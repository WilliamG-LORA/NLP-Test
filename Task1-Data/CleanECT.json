Robinson Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2010 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'll turn the conference over to Angie Freeman, C.H. Robinson Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Freeman.\nAngela Freeman\nThank you. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, CEO; and Chad Lindbloom, Senior Vice President and CFO. John and Chad will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance and we will follow that with a question-and-answer session. \n[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind you that any comments made by John, Chad or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Wiehoff\nThank you, Angie, and thanks to everybody who's taking the time to listen to our fourth quarter conference call. About an hour ago, we issued a press release sharing our fourth quarter results for 2010. I'm going to start by highlighting just a few of the key financial results on that release.\nFor our fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010, our total revenues increased 15.8% to $2.3 billion. Net revenues increased 14.5% to $388 million. Income from operations increased 14.9% to $164 million. Net income increased 17.6% to $103 million and fully diluted EPS increased 19.2% to $0.62 per share.\nThe similar metrics for the year-to-date results ended December 31, 2010, total revenues increased 22.4% to $9.3 billion. Net revenues increased 6.2% to $1.5 billion. Income from operations increased 6.5% to $622.9 million. Net income increased 7.3% to $387 million. Fully diluted EPS for the year increased 9.4% to $2.33 per share. In addition to these overall financial metrics, our press release gives more detail growth percentages by our various service offerings.\nAs Angie said, consistent with the past, we'll share some prepared comments and then open up for questions. So the fourth quarter of 2010 was the first time in a couple of years where we were able to achieve our long-term growth target of 15% in most of our key metrics. I think it's very helpful to summarize the past couple of years in our performance throughout the recession to better understand our current performance and our outlook going forward. \nTwo years ago at this time, in early 2009, we were in the peak of the great recession and experienced a meaningful volume declines in most all of our service offerings. Throughout 2009, volume growth was extremely challenging for us. We were able to grind through 2009 with a modest earnings increase. The things we highlighted throughout 2009 that enabled us to grow our earnings despite the really difficult market condition were the following: Aggressively selling and going after market share; using our strong balance sheet to absorb increased working capital needs on both the shipper and carrier side; benefiting from meaningful gross margin expansion due to the typical fluctuations in our business model; our variable cost compensation structure that keeps our operating cost flexible; and rightsizing our network where appropriate to adjust to market conditions.\nBetween a year ago at this time and early 2010, while we were feeling better about improving market conditions, we knew that throughout 2010 we would be comparing to the very high gross margins of 2009 and that achieving our long-term growth targets would remain more challenging. Throughout 2010, we were able to grow our volumes in virtually all of our services as we continued selling and market conditions continue to recover. \nGross margin comparisons did make earnings growth more challenging this year, but we were able to finish with a strong fourth quarter and 9% EPS growth for the year. The past couple of years, we discussed a lot about how our gross margins fluctuate for a variety of reasons and how we accept that as part of our business model. Overall, we're happy with our results for 2010. The recession was challenging for all of us and the past two years and have tested our business model in new ways. We're very proud that we were able to manage through the recession with an earnings increase in each of the past two years. We think that's a pretty visible statement about our business model and our execution discipline. \nWhen we analyze our results for 2010, we would highlight the following things as key contributors to our continued success: The continued acceptance and growth of third-party logistics in our business model; our expansion of services and strengthening our global network of resources; having the best people in a variable performance-based compensation system; and significant focus on automating our processes and driving productivity improvements.\nThose are some the thoughts on our overall performance and results. And now I'll transition to some more specific comments of some of our service offerings.\nStarting with Transportation Services, for the fourth quarter of 2010, our Truckload Transportation volume increased by roughly 9%. Truckload pricing for the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year was up approximately 8% versus a year ago, excluding the estimated impact of fuel. Our truckload pricing stayed relatively flat sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth this year. The economic recovery and increase in Truckload demand relative to a year ago resulted in higher prices this year. \nWithin our truckload services, the primary to topics of discussion with our customers continues to be the uncertainty of impacts going forward around regulations like CSA, hours of service and others and how the capacity site adjust if demand continues to grow during 2011. Determining pricing strategies for 2011 is as challenging as ever given the increased volatility in demand and uncertainty in the supply of trucks. We continue to promote our quality control procedures and flexible broad access to capacities as being more relevant to our customers.\nFor the LTL component of our truck revenues, our volume increased by 11%. Pricing comparisons are more difficult to quantify given that all the variations in the tariffs that we used, however LTL pricing has generally increased versus a year ago as well. The significant changes in the LTL industry landscape the past couple of years have also created a pretty high degree of change as we head into 2011. Network rationalizations and changes by the industry leaders, along with the lack of industry-wide profitability in recent years is also driving the potential for meaningful price increases heading into 2011.\nIntermodal. Intermodal net revenues for the quarter grew 9%. Our Intermodal volumes for the quarter were roughly flat. Capacity constraints did continue to limit our ability to grow Intermodal volumes during the fourth quarter. We discussed last quarter that we have made a two-year commitment for 300 containers to expand our access to boxes. We did expand that commitment by 50 more containers during the fourth quarter of 2010. Our longer-term strategy remains focused on being the best Intermodal marketing company and servicing our customers, but we do continue to look for ways to ensure that we can meet the growing demand for Intermodal services in the marketplace and ensure capacity access, while retaining a more neutral balance that we believe helps us to better provide our customer service.\nGlobal Forwarding, both our International Air and Ocean volumes increased significantly during the quarter. While much of this growth was driven by the overall recovery in the global freight markets, we do believe that our global network and service capabilities continue to strengthen and improve our participation in these markets. We will continue to invest in expanding our network and improving our global capabilities.\nGross margins. I discussed earlier the significant gross margin fluctuations in the past couple of years. Our Transportation gross margins in the fourth quarter were 17.6% compared to 18.3% in the fourth quarter last year. Over the past several years, we've discussed our pricing approach and how gross margins will naturally fluctuate for many reasons, including supply and demand fluctuations, fuel prices, mode mix and timing lags and price adjustments to customers and carriers. We view the fluctuations in gross margin as a normal part of our business model, and we continue to feel confident in our approach towards adjusting to the market conditions.\nI think it's important to note that while we cycle through the challenging comparisons from the gross margins at the high end of the range, the current quarter gross margin of 17.6% is in the middle of the range for gross margins for the past five years. Our other logistics services, net revenues includes our Transportation management fees, customs brokerage fees, as well as other fee-based revenue from expanding our service offerings. We continue to focus on account management practices and integrating services. The growth in these services continues to be strong, and is reflective of our strategy to expand services and our relationships with shippers, as well as the demand in the marketplace to improve processes and analytics.\nSourcing. As discussed in our press release, our Sourcing net revenues for the quarter decreased by 4%. We've discussed on past calls that our largest Sourcing customer, Wal-Mart, has a very comprehensive global sourcing initiative in process that's impacting our relationship. Their global sourcing realignment has resulted in lost business for us. There's really not anything new for us to add to our past comments. We continue to work through the transition with them and look for new ways to grow with them, but we do expect to continue to experience declines in volume and net revenue until the transition is complete later this year.\nThere's some new and exciting growth in our Sourcing division that's also driving new revenues for our Transportation Services, and we remain very positive about the longer-term opportunities to create value with our Sourcing services.\nInformation Services. Our Information Services revenue consists entirely of our income related to our wholly-owned subsidiary, T-Chek. T-Chek finished this strong year with a good fourth quarter. Volume growth increased fuel prices and expanding services were the growth drivers.\nMoving to our operating expenses. Our operating expense increased to 14.1% for the fourth quarter consists primarily of personnel cost increases. While we did add to our team and headcount versus a year ago, the largest portion of the increase is driven by the improvements in earnings and how our performance-based compensation plans work. Chad will comment more on that in his remarks. \nOur employees have worked hard the past few years and the increase in rewards for the strong quarter are a very positive thing for our culture and future growth. Our year-to-date personal costs reflect the variable discipline of the business. \nI'll finish my prepared thoughts with some comments about 2011 and our longer-term outlook for the future. To start, we continue to believe that third-party logistics in our business model have good momentum and increasing relevance in the marketplace. The recession has been tough, but one of the good outcomes for us is an even greater focus on things like productivity, competitive logistics, low inventories, cost savings, et cetera, that are helping to drive opportunities in our industry. While the increased opportunity is driving increased expectations and competition, we think we have a good long-term growth opportunity and our long-range plans continue to validate our long-term growth goal of 15%. We obviously need to continue to execute at a high level to achieve it, but we believe the opportunity is there and we're well-positioned to go after it. \nOur long-term growth goals are basically in three categories: To take market share; to innovate and add new services; and lastly, to expand globally. We're confident of good growth opportunities in each of those categories. Some shorter term thoughts with regards to 2011 that I'll share. All of the reasons we haven't given qualified short-term guidance in the past are more true than ever. The demand and supply variables are more volatile in most of our services, forecasting is tough and everybody's adjusting quicker to the changing market conditions. \nTransportation gross margins for the year of 2010 were around the middle of the range for the past five years. While we don't know how market conditions will change, we do know we don't have the high-end comparisons to go up like we did for most of 2010. We know heading into 2011 that our productivity metrics are generally at the high-end of our ranges. We do expect to add people as we grow. We also know that cost associated with our variable incentive plans will increase if we're successful in growing our earnings. We also know that we have better net revenue growth momentum starting 2011 than we've had the past couple of years. January is generally the slowest month of the year, and our market, especially the Truckload market, can change quickly as demand increases in the spring, especially with the uncertainties towards capacity additions. \nI would sum up my comments by saying that we're proud of 2010 and especially proud that we made it through the past two years without breaking our streak of annual earnings increases. We continue to have confidence in our long-term growth goals, and we have good momentum starting 2011 though market uncertainty is high. \nThank you. Those are my prepared comments and I'll turn it over to Chad for his.\nChad Lindbloom\nThanks, John. I'm going to give some comments on our personnel expenses, income taxes, balance sheet and cash flow statement. \nOur personnel expense increased to 43.6% of net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 42.4% last year's fourth quarter. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in our restricted stock expense. Our stock-based compensation expense was $14.5 million for the quarter compared to $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. \nThe majority of our stock-based compensation expense was driven by the vesting of our performance-based restricted stock awards. The vesting of these awards is based on our earnings growth rate. Each quarter, we accrue based on the year-to-date growth in earnings. When earnings growth rate increases throughout the year as it did in 2010, the expense accelerates throughout the year as well. \nFor the year, our stock-based compensation expense was $37.1 million compared to $21.3 million in 2009. This increase was driven primarily by a 13% vesting of our performance-based restricted stock in 2010 compared to 7% in 2009.\nMoving on to our income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 37.2% for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 38.8% in 2009. This unusually low rate was driven by reversing reserves for two uncertain foreign tax positions. The needs for these reserves were eliminated by a favorable audit outcome and the expiration of a statute of limitation. We expect our tax rates to fluctuate in the future between 38% and 38.5%, excluding unusual items such as these.\nMoving on to our balance sheet. Our balance sheet remained strong with cash and investments of $408 million. We had a very strong cash flow quarter as we usually do in the fourth quarter. Our investment and working capital decreased compared to the end of the third quarter, which is normal as volumes drop off late in the year. It's important to remember that approximately $85 million of cash will be used early in the first quarter to pay our accrued bonuses and profit-sharing.\nOur net cap CapEx for the quarter including capitalized software was $7 million. This includes continued investments in our international forwarding and T-Chek systems. We expect our CapEx, including our continued increased investment in capitalized software to be approximately $40 million during 2011. \nWe have discussed in the past our strategy of using share repurchases as a variable way to return excess capital to our shareholders. Our capital strategy has remained consistent. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 544,580 shares at an average price of $75.29. \nThat concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ed Wolfe with Wolfe Trahan & Co.\nEdward Wolfe - Bear Stearns\nWould you mind taking us through from a gross yield perspective on the Truck side the last couple of quarters? If I look at the $17.6 million Transportation yield in fourth quarter, it's up from $16.6 million in the third quarter and $15.8 million second quarter. What's driving that change? And as we get through, what should be a seasonally slower first quarter, fuel is up but there should be more capacity. How should we think about it?\nJohn Wiehoff\nThe challenging part of that, Ed, is I rattled off the four or five key variables that impacted. Some of it is typical seasonal fluctuation where different times of the year, the margins will trend. I have in front of me a schedule from the last 10 years, which is all public information around the margins and how they vary from quarter-to-quarter. And it's really challenging to find patterns from it. When you look at supply and demand variations, as well as looking at it quarterly, it's really difficult to predict where it's going to go.\nEdward Wolfe - Bear Stearns\nNot so much predict, but for instance, you said pricing was up 8% pretty steady with third quarter and fourth quarter. But the gross yield expanded 100 basis points. Can you talk to why that would happen in this fourth quarter relative to third quarter?\nJohn Wiehoff\nWell, from an overall standpoint, what we talked about last year and throughout 2009, as the market was soft; we were getting a lot of volume challenges. But the pricing was going down. So this year, throughout 2010, with each quarter, you'll see more favorable price increases compared to a year ago. But the volume comparisons got more challenging as the year wore on. So throughout 2010 that those gross yields prepped up a little bit. I think it's just a combination of pricing, comparing more favorably to the previous year and our longer-term contracts having a more stable cost of hire for these last couple of quarters than when it was jumping around last year.\nEdward Wolfe - Bear Stearns\nAnd just as my second question, where are you versus a year ago in terms of commitment to your rates with your customers? In other words, how much of your business is going to be put out for bids over the next couple of quarters relative to where you were a year ago at this point?\nJohn Wiehoff\nI would say it's fairly consistent. Again, at least we look at the marketplaces that there's no real set annual cycle to it, but there's generally more activity in the beginning of the year. So a lot of shippers are in the middle of some sort of bid process. What I would say in general what happened throughout 2010 is that many shippers ended up having more volume than they plan to at the beginning of the year. So that we had a lot of customer relationships where we ended up with incremental volume relative to what was awarded during a bid at the beginning of 2010. So what a lot of shippers are sorting through now and what we're in the middle of with a lot of our customers is looking at who performed on the freight and what the metrics were throughout 2010 and what are appropriate bid allocations for 2011. Depending upon how the market condition works, to us, the bid allocations or the bid awards are one interesting step in the process. But then it's almost more relevant to us as to how the market compares to what everybody was anticipating and whether the freight is generally being routed along those bid awards or there's a lot more freight or a lot less freight. So we're in the midst of it right now just like we always are this time of the year.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Scott Flower with Macquarie Securities (sic) [Research].\nScott Flower - Macquarie Research\nWondered if you could give us some flavor for what impact you've seen in terms of your carrier base with CSA 2010 and the scoring it may not be real-time in terms people dropping drivers up. I'm just wondering what you've preliminary seen and how this has impacted, how you see your carrier development efforts in the next year.\nJohn Wiehoff\nSo in our press release, a couple of key metrics that we disclosed and update once a year are the active customer IDs and the active carrier IDs and those disclosed in our press release were 36,000 customer IDs and 49,000 transport providers. I believe the customer number is up 1,000 from a year ago and the carrier number is up 2,000 from a year ago. And the way we've always approached it is that each quarter, we are signing up -- there's a little bit of churn in each of those and each quarter, we're signing up thousands of new on each side and there's unfortunately some that drop off for a  variety of reasons. Throughout 2010, we were able to grow our active carrier base. There's certainly been some element of all the carriers, understanding the new rules and kind of preparing for compliance and looking at the stuff. I'm sure there'll be some continued transition throughout 2011 as the rules become effective and everybody works to comply with them. The way we look at it, I guess, is that it could have some degree of accentuated churn or a little bit of contraction on that universe of carriers that are out there. But we don't see it as being a unique variable that we're really going to ever be able to isolate or believe that it will have a sort of uniquely material impact on what we do.\nScott Flower - Macquarie Research\nAnd then I guess the other question and obviously, you've added some commitment to boxes. But obviously if you look at the last several years, Intermodal hasn't grown on a net revenue basis as the other modes have, and it's got some unique characteristics. I'm just wondering how do you see Intermodal perspectively as part of your portfolio? Do you want it to be a sort of an alternative, but not necessarily something you want to be too big in? Is it something that, as the world gets a little bit of a tighter in capacity overall and shippers perhaps looking at our middle more that you want to be a bit bigger than you've been in the past? Help me with how you think about Intermodal prospectively.\nJohn Wiehoff\nI would say there's two lenses into that. One is us being in an Intermodal marketing company [IMC] and providing Intermodal transportation services to our customers as the transport provider working with the railroads and the traditional IMC role. That's where our growth and volume has been limited some of the last couple of years because of the access to capacity piece of it. And we're going to continue as an IMC to meet with all the railroads and talk about capacity alignment and make sure that we're making good business decisions about where we can profitably grow as a transport provider in Intermodal and aligned with the railroad business plans in the way that we think makes sense. Another lens into it though is that we are more and more providing outsourced solutions and process management solutions for a lot of the customers that we work with. And the most important thing in that area is that all of our customers get efficient access to Intermodal services if that's what's right for their freight. And we do believe that through a variety of methods and partnerships with other Intermodal providers or asset-based solutions that we can develop more and more solutions and are doing that now as part of our management services. So a growing part of our management fees and other services are involved in relationships where Intermodal is part of the solution. So when we talk about recognizing that it's a very important part of our portfolio and that we're going to make sure that we're bringing it to the right customers at the right point in time, and making sure that we're optimizing their supply chain and Transportation as good as possible, and then executing on that Intermodal freight as an IMC wherever we can most effectively do that.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose.\nJason Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC\nI wanted to concentrate a little bit on the capacity outlook. Because one of your competitors at a conference call earlier sounded like they had a little bit of doubts that coupler [ph] (32:52) capacity would tighten significantly in 2011. They were really targeting more for 2012. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that comment.\nJohn Wiehoff\nIt's so hard to predict, and we sort of consciously stay out of that. I would say when we've looked at it and when we talk to our customers and/or talk in the industry, if you look at all the variables and all of the factors that are involved on whether or not the supply-side is going to add capacity, there is an a lot of uncertainty. There's significant rule changes that are coming or possibly coming. There's still lots of challenges around financing and equipment orders. There's the driver shortage issue, which has come and gone and is still there statistically in terms of what needs to happen. And it's really just more of question what happens with freight demand this year. And if the demand accelerates significantly during the year, we do believe that the supply side will have a more challenging time of having capacity quickly and there probably will be meaningful price increases in tight markets. But the more meaningful or volatile variable in that equation is the freight demand and what's going to happen on the truckload side. So depending upon your view and prediction of the economy and what overall freight demand will look like throughout 2011, I think that would drive your belief on how tight the market will be.\nJason Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC\nIf I could just switch to LTL, obviously you mentioned a meaningful price increase there as well. As know you talk to your customers out there, are they preparing themselves for significant LTL price increases here in 2011, as your carriers try to start making profits again?\nJohn Wiehoff\nYes, I would say nobody really wants to use the word significant because everybody's freight is a little bit different and all of us are working on process improvements and other things to try to minimize what cost increases there might be. But I would say at the same time, there is pretty widespread recognition that there has been a lot of chasing of market share and a lot of very aggressive pricing in the depths of the recession. And that the industry has been losing money and that the outlook for 2011 is quite a bit different. So I would say as a general rule, yes, customers understand that prices are probably moving up, but then everybody is working to try to minimize what those increases will be.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.\nWilliam Greene - Morgan Stanley\nIn the past, I think you've had claims against you when there was an accident on the road, and I think you fended those off pretty well. With the new CSA regulations and given that it will give a lot of the drivers and the carriers specific grades, does that suggest to you that it'll make it easier to go after brokers or for that matter, maybe shippers that use a carrier with a poor CSA ranking? How do you think about that?\nAngela Freeman\nBill, this is Angie. I think the short answer to that is we don't know yet. And the big reason that we don't know any of that yet is because we're still in the early stages of CSA being rolled out. So they haven't released more information what's called the basics scores. I won't get on that but how the basic scores ultimately compute to be to roll up into safety fitness determinations, which is the ultimate safety rating of the carrier. That's not been determined and won't be, from what we hear, until at least this summer. So until that time, it's premature to speculate how that might impact overall so liability rolls around this. But in as much as we've been encouraging and hopeful that FMCSA would provide some clarity around the bright line of what is a safe carrier and an unsafe carrier, that would be helpful to that.\nWilliam Greene - Morgan Stanley\nAnd then as a follow-up, John, your comments you mentioned competition as something that you're thinking about. Were you being just sort of -- is that a generic comment? Was there something specific where you've actually seen competition in this segment rise in a material way?\nJohn Wiehoff\nI would say it's a general comment that we've been making over the last several years. And I guess, the way we look at it is the data that we have and the stuff that we read would suggest that logistics and third-party logistics are growing, and taking market share disproportionately. So the basic idea would be that as companies have taken advantage of lower-cost labor and complicated their supply chains, the spend has increased disproportionate to GDP. And third-party logistics has probably grown within the logistic spend and that we're not the only ones who understand that and see that. So that just in general, there are more companies and more dollars being invested in the space, so that competition in general is increasing. But it was nothing referencing anything specific or different in terms of how competition has been increasing as our opportunity has been.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Matt Brooklier with Piper Jaffray.\nMatthew Brooklier - Piper Jaffray Companies\nWanted to touch on the Sourcing business. In the quarter, gross revenue down. It was kind of flattish in third quarter. You'd indicated that one of your larger customers taking more of their Sourcing bids in-house. Maybe you could just provide a little bit more color on kind of where they are in that process, if you will, and expectations for sourcing revenue going forward?\nJohn Wiehoff\nYou're right that we were down in the fourth quarter, which was definitely in the third quarter was still up slightly. The difference is that they've gotten farther along in their plans on what they are going to insource and outsource. We still are what business are going to take away from us. We still don't know the exact timing of when this will all play out, but we expect to continue to lose items and certain DCs [ph] (38:59) throughout the remainder of 2011. As far as being able to quantify the impact, we do not have that information available. Are continually changing as well as the timing.\nMatthew Brooklier - Piper Jaffray Companies\nAnd John, you talked to C.H. being kind of in growth mode at this point in time, you're at the high end of it in terms of the employee utilization if you will. Do you have a sense for how many hedge you want to add in '11 and kind of the timing of those employee additions?\nJohn Wiehoff\nSo what we have always said from a longer-term perspective that if our long-term growth goal is 15% that with our productivity initiatives and perpetual cost improvement ideas that we would try to grow our heads at something less than that. But realistically, it would need to be double-digit growth. So when we look at 2011, again, it's very difficult to predict and we will add people as the volume and freight activities justify it. So we will add them monthly throughout the year. And then we'll adjust as the volume warrants. But we do expect that unlike the last couple of years where we started with some excess capacity and then really focused on automation and process improvement that, going forward, if we do have double-digit volume growth, that we're probably going to be adding closer to double-digit headcount increases.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Alex Brand with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.\nAlexander Brand - Stephens Inc.\nI guess, John, I just wanted to try to get some color. I think Ed went down this road, and didn't get far. But I'm going to try again. If we think about your 7% volume growth in January, and your trend is improving on a gross margin side, is the rest of the net revenue growth -- is there a trend in gross profit per load in Truckload that accounts for most of that? Or is there something else that gets you to the mid teens?\nJohn Wiehoff\nI mean, with Truckload being such a big percentage of it, it would be a safe conclusion to draw that if our Truckload volume is up, but a significantly low number than our total net revenues, then our profit per load is out.\nAlexander Brand - Stephens Inc.\nAnd as I think about -- you guys are clearly more optimistic than I think I've heard you in a while. And as your cycle turns here in your business and you're finally past the really tough gross margin comps, how do we think about operating leverage in 2011? Does the vesting of restricted stock hurt us again too much to get leverage in '11 or do you feel like there is some upside to the operating margins?\nChad Lindbloom\nThe best thing on restricted stock, well, can add varying growth rates have a drag. I think when we went in to 2010, we set up our growth rate accelerates to near 15%. We could see 1.5% or 1% to 2% drag on operating income as a percent of net revenue, while we didn't get that high of a growth rate in 2010, but we did experience about a 1% drag on personnel expenses as a percent of net revenue. So, yes, if our earnings grow faster, that could create more expense as a percent of net revenues. But at the same time, even within personnel during 2010, if you back out the restricted stock expenses or the stock based compensation expenses, you will see that our personnel expenses as a percent of net revenue did decline. So I think we constantly strive for ways to leverage the business model and become more productive including those productivity initiatives that John mentioned earlier in the call and investments we\u2019re making in technology and processes. So we do hope to gain future leverage, but the primary driver of future earnings growth will definitely be net revenues and volumes.\nOperator\nI think your next question comes from Jon Langenfeld from Robert W. Baird & Co.\nJon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated\nJust building on that question, Chad, are there any plans to issue another tranche of restricted stock?\nChad Lindbloom\nThis year, well, during 2010, one of those, what we used to call three-year awards, is now completed, that's five years of being available to best. We did do another three-year award that has still got some time on it. But since then, we have shifted to more of an annual restricted stock award program. So as of right now, we don't expect another one of those large three-year awards, if that's what you're asking.\nJon Langenfeld - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated\nAnd then on the CapEx side, can you just talk about the need for CapEx over the next three to five years? How you're thinking about that? More on a general basis than anything specific in terms of numbers.\nChad Lindbloom\nWhen you look at CapEx over the last couple of years or at least last year, you'll see that we did continue to invest in technology hardware, one of the biggest pieces of that, and we've often talked about our maintenance CapEx being in the neighborhood of $6 million, which is primarily technology equipment. Beginning last year, we started having some significant dollars of capitalized software. In 2010, it was about $11 million and that was split between T-Chek and the Transportation system. Primarily last year was focused on International Forwarding. Going forward in 2011, when I mentioned that we expect our total CapEx to be in the neighborhood of $40 million, somewhere around $13 million or $15 million of that will be or is expected to be in future technology development in software. So split both between T-Chek, as well as further improvements over our Transportation technology to drive some of those productivity initiatives that we talked about earlier. So when you look in the previous years of 2010, a lot of our technology spend was spent on enhancements and maintenance. We're definitely shifting towards building more functionality and vastly improving our systems going forward. I would expect in the next three to five years that we will continue to make some significant investments in improving our overall platform. So we could continue to see that spend in that neighborhood of capitalized software going forward.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Justin Yagerman from Deutsche Bank.\nJustin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG\nTypically, you guys talk about your business being, with your customers, at least being 50% contractual, 50% transactional. And with demand tightening or expected to tighten as we move through the year, what's the swing there? As capacity tightens, the demographics work against the truckload industry for adding more capacity. How much your business can swing to transactional in that type of a market? And then when that business is coming on at full speed, what usually is the relative gross margin premium that you guys were able to earn to kind of the average every quarter?\nChad Lindbloom\nWell, I started to explain before. I guess, our definition of contractual versus transactional is primarily driven by where we have some sort of longer-term, pre-agreed price arrangement versus where the price is negotiated more in the current spot market. And for instance, in 2010, while we may have started the year with close to that sort of 50/50, meaning that maybe half of the Truckload volume that we moved, we were allocated to some kind of bid or annual price arrangement. Throughout the year, with a lot of the customers that we interacted with, we ended up getting more freight because they had higher volumes than they had planned for at the beginning of the year. When that incremental freight comes in, in the beginning of a tightening market, it can actually be a tighter margins than was originally planned. So if we're getting incremental volume and the market is tightening up and our cost of hire is increasing, but we have not made a price adjustment upwards with the shipper, and we're honoring incremental volume at current pricing, it can actually have a negative impact on our margins. When the market gets very tight and we implement incremental pricing or start to handle incremental volumes on a purely transactional basis, where we're adjusting pricing daily based upon market conditions, that freight is generally at normal or sometimes even better margins. So it really depends upon customer-specific, lane-specific, how and when we choose to adjust the pricing based upon the commitments and the relationship as to whether that incremental volume will hurt our margins or improve our margins.\nJustin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG\nI guess, the last time we saw that really happen in a big way was probably the second quarter or it was June. The market heated up in a big way. What are the ingredients for that type of environment in your mind and how will we know it when we're in it?\nJohn Wiehoff\nFor all the reasons that we talked about with uncertainty and reluctance to add capacity, I guess our general outlook has been that if we have sustained economic growth and there's increases in the absolute demands for freight throughout 2011, you're going to start to see the peak shipping periods in the spring and summer, where you're going to have a pretty tight market. And we will see it. I mean, one of the things that we get pretty good visibility to is that day-to-day supply and demand relationship just based upon how many trucks are available and how many shipments were moving in the marketplace. So it literally for us is a day-by-day thing of just adjusting to the supply-and-demand relationship. And if those freight volumes stay high, we do believe that capacity will react slowly this year for all of the reasons we've discussed previously and we'll probably feel it pretty quickly.\nJustin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG\nAnd then the last question, if I could, would just be on the Intermodal boxes that you guys are managing. Can you talk a little bit about how you got those managed and what networks they're running on and how you kind of balance those to make sure that you've got some swing capacity for your customers?\nJohn Wiehoff\nSo all 350 boxes are on the Burlington Northern. And again, that is driven primarily through their philosophy or business preference of asset ownership and kind of the line commitments on their network. So we're managing that on their network and the program is going very well. And so we've expanded it a little bit. The pre-operating equipment, the Intermodal pools and the other railroads that we work with, there is a different philosophy and a longer-term commitment towards providing some level of capacity in the marketplace. So really, our strategy or approach with the other rails is to understand their longer-term goals and expectations. And what we do expect is that there will be, in general, more equipment available as some of the other rails do invest or some of the other pools invest in incremental equipment. So what we're looking at, as I described earlier, is for all of the major relationships, all the major railroads that we do business with is to make sure that our approach and philosophy is aligned with theirs so that we can access equipment and service on all of them on a cost-competitive basis and provide that to the marketplace. So for now, that equipment that we have a longer-term commitment to is all on the BNSF and then the other rails we continue to function as a traditional IMC.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nChristopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG\nBack to the comment before about CSA and the incremental risk that you might bear, is this something that would show up in the form of an increased reserve or some sort of an ongoing expense that you might have to carry to protect yourself?\nChad Lindbloom\nThe only increased ongoing expense that I could think of that may come into place is if the insurance companies look at us as being a higher risk because the accidents where we get sued for liability are so infrequent that those are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\nChristopher Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG\nAnd then just back to the comment about gross margin being in the middle of the range and thinking about various inputs, whether it's mix or capacity or price, as you go forward into '11, is your general expectation that you go back up or that you go back down, or that you stay here? And where are we headed on gross margins?\nJohn Wiehoff\nThe general expectation is we don't know. It really depends upon fuel prices, and it depends upon the supply and demand relationship that will change daily as we talked before. And what we pride ourselves on is being able to react under either of the circumstances. If you told me that we were going to have tremendous GDP growth this year and that freight demand would be very strong, I would tell you that the market would most likely tighten up in 2011 and we would probably expect that margins would compress and maybe go to the low end of the range. If the demand really softens and we end up with very accessible capacity throughout the year, we would probably have less volume growth and expanded margins, especially in comparison to 2010. So we don't make a forecast, we don't make it internally and we don't publish one externally. And we really more are working with our capacity providers and our shippers to try to match whatever each of the individual strategies is, and then we adjust to the market depending on how it happens.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Scott Malat with Goldman Sachs.\nScott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nOn branches, I know it's nowhere near as important as kind of the number of employees, but it's also a way that you've kind of traditionally been able to give it seem like some of your top-performing employees a platform or upward mobility. Can we think about how your branches are expected to maybe ramp up this year? Does it move up with employee growth? Does that stay more flat or how do we think about that?\nJohn Wiehoff\nI think is a good question, and for those of you who didn't notice, one of the metrics in our press release is that at the end of 2010, we did have 231 branch locations versus 235 a year ago. And that is unusual for us that we would have a reduction in locations throughout the year. The philosophy that you described around investing in new locations and expanding our network and making that part of the career path for a lot of our people, that philosophy is still alive and we will continue to pursue that going forward. Even in good years in the past, we've always had a more modest number of new locations. I think we've said five to seven, and a much lower percentage increase in the number of locations that we would be hoping to grow overall. But it is an important part of the growth strategy. When we look at the last couple of years, and I've made statements like new test to our business model and kind of new focuses on productivity and automation, one of the things that we've lived through the last couple of years is just making sure that as we were, at times, rightsizing our network and really focusing in on automation and account management practices more aggressively than we have in the past, we also cleaned up a few offices. Most of those were combined locations where we thought two offices would work better as one and get more density to it. And we've also put a pause on opening new locations while we streamline the productivity of all the current locations. Our hope would be that throughout 2011 that we would get back to some sort of a growth strategy. But again, it would be a much more modest number relative to what our longer-term growth expectations would be.\nScott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nCan you guys give us the number of sales people at the end of the year? You usually give that in the K, but I'm wondering I you have that now.\nJohn Wiehoff\nWe don't have it yet.\nScott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nJust lastly, just on January growing at midteens, just help us think about the comparisons were like for February and March of last year. Does it get tougher or easier on a comparison basis?\nJohn Wiehoff\nI don't think we gave out sequential information during the last quarter, and we don't plan on giving that out now.\nScott Malat - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nJanuary of mid teens -- so you're not saying from 2010, you won't give out February and March, is that what you're saying?\nJohn Wiehoff\nYes.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Chris Weatherby [ph] (56:39) from Citigroup.\nUnidentified Analyst\nMaybe get back on the CSA side, I guess. As you have conversations with your customers, is there any discussion or have you had any discussion particularly maybe some of your larger customers about your approach to dealing with carriers that may have lower safety scores as you go forward? I mean, has there been any preliminary discussions as of yet?\nJohn Wiehoff\nThere's been lots of discussions. As I mentioned, it's been a primary topic of conversation throughout the year. And you know, on the positive side for us, It's really been an avenue for us to highlight and remind all of our customers, all of the quality control investments and processes that we've had in place for dozens of years around qualifying carriers and making sure that they have the proper operating authority. I mean, most people seem to have forgotten that there has been a safety process in place for quite some time now. This is just an improved one. So all of the things around making sure that your operating authority is effective and that your safety rating is acceptable, those are procedures that we've had in place for some quite some time. These enhanced safety rules, the CSA that are going to come out, there are some things that we've been changing in our operating system and preparing for to be ready to implement and manage whatever new rules there are, just like we have been in the best. But as Angie suggested earlier, one of the key pieces of information that we and others are waiting for is just sort of that final translation of how do you apply all these new safety triggers and guidelines into an assessment of whether a carrier gets to keep their operating authority or not and whether or not they're on probation or fit to drive or how that works. So there's some final pieces to the puzzle that we'll be ready to implement as aggressively as we have any other change in the past than it has been a very relevant topic of conversation with all of our customers in the planning process this year.\nUnidentified Analyst\nAnd switching gears onto the Sourcing side, as you look at the gross margin progression kind of as Wal-Mart is getting further along in their realignment, have you noticed any kind of trends coming out of that? Has there been any positive or particularly negative relative to the gross margin Sourcing as a result of that change?\nJohn Wiehoff\nNo, I would say it's fairly typical and one of the primary reasons why we can't quantify, we'd love to better understand ourselves some of the questions around exactly what impact there will be and how it will phase out. But even in the past with the more dedicated programs that we've had, the volume would fluctuate pretty meaningful from year to year based on price and market conditions and the timing of their programs or promotions. So we know that certain categories have dedicated activities that were there a year ago, won't be there going forward. But there still will be fluctuations from year to year. There may be transactional or different types of opportunities within those same categories this year, even though the higher volume dedicated activity is not there. So from year to year, season to season, there's lots of normal fluctuation. And the challenging part for us now is that we know certain committed activities where we were automatically replenishing and managing a category will not be there. What we've got to do our best to try to stay involved in the activity and sell product and stay involved in those categories. But we know that just looking at the last couple of quarters and looking going forward, the likely outcome is that we'll have declines for at least the next couple of quarters.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Tom Wadewitz with JP Morgan.\nThomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co\nI wanted to ask you a little bit, Chad, on some of your comments that you provided on restricted stock expense. They were helpful to give a framework. If you're in 2011 and your kind of normal framework or expected growth is 15% net revenue growth, would that imply that you'd see a further significant step-up in your restricted stock expense? Or would that type of scenario imply that versus the $37 million in 2010 that you'd be reasonably stable?\nChad Lindbloom\nIt's really difficult to predict but it's more about earnings. But I would say if we grew exactly 15%, restricted stock as a percentage of net revenue, it will probably go up slightly compared to where it was in 2010. Part of that reason, there's only one of those three-year grants, which was granted in 2008 and started vesting in 2009 and will finish vesting in 2013. There was two of those large three-year grants last year. So that will provide a little bit of tailwind, but the increased earnings will also provide a little bit of a headwind. So my guess is at exactly 15% earnings growth, it would be a slight increase in net revenue per -- we consider the stock expense as a percent of the net revenues, but not as major as we experienced in 2010 from a growth perspective.\nThomas Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co\nAnd how do we think about that you said you kind of gone from three-year programs to one-year programs. So I guess, you don't have two three-year programs vesting at once, but you do have two programs, right? In 2009 you got the three-year but then also a one-year program that'll be vesting?\nJohn Wiehoff\nWe made one of those one-year grants in 2009 that began vesting this year. We made another one at the end of 2010. That will begin vesting in '11. So the impacts in moving to one year is already baked in.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Peter Nesvold with Jefferies & Company.\nH. Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc.\nIt's been a couple of years since I've read the case, but I think it was the Schramm case back in '04, which is where you're held liable for an accident  for negligent hiring. And if I remember back to the legal theory behind that, the agency theory, it would seem like that theory applies directly to a shipper as well now under CSA. I know this question came up a little bit earlier, but I'm curious, in your conversations with shippers so far from CSA, is that dialogue coming up at all? Do shippers see maybe more of a value of hiring a broker to have the intermediary there to maybe buffer that legal liability?\nAngela Freeman\nI wouldn't go that far. But it is accurate to say that the theory of what's called negligent hire that you hire the carrier that you should've known was not safe. Thus, that risk does apply to anybody who hires a carrier, whether it's a third party, a broker or a shipper. So that does inform some of those conversations that we're having with customers about how under the new CSA environment when there's a lot more data and information to manage and potentially the choices you make have more weight, that there's good reason to think about working with somebody who's got good quality control to play some processes to make sure that they're staying up-to-date on the information that's relevant.\nH. Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc.\nAnd as a follow up, on the Landstar call about an hour and a half ago or so. They run through some numbers that I thought it was interesting, and I know we've talked a lot about CSA already in this call, but I think it's going to be something that people ask about a lot for us in the next few months. They say that they went through their carrier base. They're eliminating about 10% of total carriers. In terms of the percentage of trucks, it was only a few percentage of trucks because they tend to be the really small guys. And even of those couple of percentage points of trucks they're eliminating, only half had actually moved to load for them in the last 90 days. Is there any kind of comparable analysis that you could walk us through, or is there anything that you could provide the market perhaps in the future to help us understand exactly how all this impacts your business and your ability to source capacity at attractive rates?\nAngela Freeman\nI think again as the CSA rules evolve and we have more clarity and when we know, we don't have any clarity today around how the basic scores translate in to the safety fitness determinations, then we'll know which of the carriers we might currently be working with today will no longer be viable choices for us. But because today we don't know what that impact might be, and in fact I don't believe the FMCSA has provided any color on what percentage of the total carrier base in the country they think will fall under the new category, we simply don't know. But it's a good point that as more information comes available, we know everybody's very interested. We'll be doing more analysis to try to determine which if any of the carriers we currently work with, we won't be working with in the future.\nH. Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc.\nIs there any time timeframe in which you're anticipating that you might give more guidance on that?\nAngela Freeman\nThe published information on that is currently stating I believe that at sometime this summer, when what they call the safety fitness determination rules will come out.\nOperator\nOur last question comes from Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch.\nKen Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch\nBack, if I look at your acquisition history, there were only two years out of the past 13 that you didn't make any acquisitions back in 2001 and 2010. Now that you've got this $408 million in cash, I just wonder, Chad, now that the market's off the bottom do you see the discussions picking up pace? How are you thinking about it in terms of using that cash?\nChad Lindbloom\nOne of the things that we talked about over the last couple of years is that we did slow down the amount of acquisition or amount of effort we are putting into international forwarding acquisitions while we rolled out our system. Now, as we have a worldwide platform that would make integration efforts a lot easier than they currently are. So I think we're still kind of sticking to that path where we probably don't expect a significant amount of activity, prospecting our international forwarding acquisitions during 2011. But as far as the market heating up or coming off the bottom, through the downturn, we continue to look for acquisitions. We just didn't find the right ones that met our criteria. So we are actively looking for acquisitions, and we'll also continue to return cash to shareholders if we don't find ways to deploy the cash that's on the balance sheet.\nKen Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch\nAnd then just a follow up, on the 7% volume growth you talked about in the first quarter versus last quarter, I think you've posted a 9% volume growth. Should we look at that as a slowing year-over-year basis you looking at as comps are getting tougher. I just want to understand how you're looking at that 7% growth in terms of pace of business.\nChad Lindbloom\nI would say both things that you said are shared by a lot of us internally that comps are definitely getting more difficult but that January doesn't feel like demand has been real strong. But part of the challenge is that January is always the slowest month of the year from an absolute demand standpoint. So it's tough to get a gauge on it. When you get out into the March, April timeframe, you get a lot better sense. We do, at least, in terms of how fragile that supply-demand relationship is and if demand is going to tighten up fast enough that there's going to be meaningful price adjustments. So tougher comps, maybe little bit of a so-so start, but it's January.\nAngela Freeman\nUnfortunately, we are out of time. So that will have to be our last question. We're sorry we couldn't get to all the questions today. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter 2010 conference call.

(NYSE:PFE)\nCiti Global Healthcare Conference Call\nDecember 8, 2016 14:10 ET\nExecutives\nMikael Dolsten - President, R&D\nAnalysts\nAndrew Baum - Citi\nAndrew Baum\nAll right, I have a couple of slides. Okay. I'll -- so I think we're going to start the session if everyone would like to take a seat, it's the last session of the last day, so from here on in, it\u2019s home run. So -- look, thank you for joining us today. We're delighted to introduce I guess speaker for this keynote, Mikael Dolsten. Mikael is President of Pfizer R&D as many of you know. We've also got Chuck Triano and colleagues who run the Investor Relations team with us in the audience today. I know Mikael wants to stay to give us a brief overview and then we'll just take segue to the Q&A. So thank you for joining us.*\nMikael Dolsten\nThank you very much for inviting us here. Like always, we start with forward-looking statements that include cautionary language about our presentation. You can find a copy of the slide at our filings and our webpage. \nSo we wanted to just have a kind of a quick glimpse as we have -- look at our track record since 2010-11, year to today. As we have kind of focused only on what we think are the most productive areas. We have built a portfolio with a mix of small molecule, biologicals and vaccines, and a highlight to some of the -- about 20 key approvals since that starting date of which about half are new medical entities, on average three approvals per year, one to two of them being NMEs. And you note, IBRANCE, our leading novel cell cycle inhibitor for hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Prevnar 13, the number one vaccines in the world including more recently, adult indication next to the previous infant; INLYTA second line renal cells carcinoma; XALKORI, [indiscernible] poster child for treatment with precision medicine lung cancer; XELJANZ, the first launched JAK inhibitor for inflammation diseases, RA; Eliquis that are preferred by cardiologists, noval oral anti-coagulants for stroke prevention, venous thrombosis. And to the right, two of the recently acquired drugs with either marketed for some indication like Xtandi in prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, and Crisaborole which is in late registration phase, PDUFA date, early January next year for atopic dermatitis.***\nWhen you look at the pipeline that deliver this flow of Phase 3 and approvals, we have about 90 projects. Slightly more than 40% in Phase 3 registration, slightly less than 40% in Phase 1, and about 20% in Phase 2; about two-thirds are NMEs and about 50-50 are small molecules versus biologicals; and that really is quite aligned with the goals that we set a few years ago. \n2016 has been a productive robust year for us. We added a second indication IBRANCE in U.S., the re current breast cancer in fibroid [ph] and we got approval for both, advanced and recurrent breast cancer in Europe. I'm making it clearly - the class leader in both continents.\nXALKORI was approved for a second indication, ROS positive non-small cell lung cancer, and we're actually exploring a third indication, a MET positive lung cancer in our clinical development. We added a once a day formulation of XELJANZ and Prevnar 13 got approved for infant in China expanding it to a very important market for future use in prevention of pneumococcal disease.* \nWe are in submission Phase 4 of a few different drugs. Inotuzumab and Mylotarg are two classical antibody drug conjugates for liquid tumors, both in filing phase for U.S. and Europe. Inotuzumab has also breakthrough designation. In immune-oncology we're able to move our PD-L1 inhibitor to the first filed indication, Merkel cell carcinoma where we have both breakthrough status and [priority] [ph] review.\nAnd finally, we expect project end of this year ertugliflozin to be filed in three different forms together with U.S. Merck, monotherapy, fixed dose with JANUVIA and fixed dose combination with metformin.** \nSo looking at the earlier to mid-stature of the portfolio in 2016, I think we had a quite good momentum in building up a portfolio with a number of very meaningful and some really transformational drug opportunities.\nIn Alzheimer we have now focused on secretion inhibitors and we have a clinical Phase 1 data that are favorable, shown potency in reducing amyloid for BACE and the first Gamma Secretase Modulators that has a design and activity in clinical studies. The other component in Phase 1 that I wanted to highlight is to with the best of my knowledge the most advanced dual Tyk2/JAK1, really interesting profile based on what we learned with XELJANZ and particular Tyk2 extend activity to inhibit IL-12, IL-23 like cytokines which we think will be critical for improved profiling diseases like psoriasis, Crohn's, [indiscernible] etcetera.***\nI'm very pleased to share with you that's our C. difficile vaccine which is a unique high-technology genetically engineered two-component vaccine has reached positive proof-of-concept criteria showing very high percent of individual reaching the bar for meaningful immunogenicity levels against the two toxins and their levels reached were regarded as very high in a large number of individuals.\nRecently at ASH we communicated at Glasdegib a SMO [indiscernible] inhibitor had favorable data in a subset of AML. And we have shared I think six different Phase 3 studies ertugliflozin, a top line level as we prepare for submission. XELJANZ is now reaching its second step, going into new regions, and new indications. Tofacitinib, the active ingredient reported strong data in ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis, and we are in advanced registration phase for the RA indication in Europe. You can also see some of the early phase assets P-cadherin Bi functional antibody, a really novel agent which is now the number 10 immunoncology NME in our pipeline in the clinic.***\nA JAK1 inhibitor dosed in atopic dermatitis, we think it has a profile that would hit very nicely to IL-4, IL-13 cytokines that monoclonals have shown to be very important in that disease. And then Avelumab that I mentioned briefly for Merkel cell carcinoma, started six different phase 3 [cross][ph] solid tumors including one additional combo study with Inlyta for renal cell cancer. We think Inlyta has a really interesting profile as a targeted agent together with [IL] [ph] compounds as shared earlier when we combined it with KEYTRUDA from U.S. Merck.****\nVery briefly when it comes to internal versus external, we really have our strategic ambition to be a networked R&D organization, some strong capabilities internally welcoming biotech and pharma partners and you can see three example of that approach. Product acquisitions through M&A, Medivation, access to Xtandi, Talazoparib among other things, Anacor which was the company providing crisaborole, the topical PD-4 inhibitor. Next to that we have strategic acquisition of technology and early product. Bamboo is a company engaged in gene therapy and provided to us what we think is the most comprehensive manufacturing of clinical gene therapy material in the United States and also have two project for entry into neurological disease gene therapy scheduled 17 and 18 for first in humans. And then a partnership with Western Oncolytics that provides us with an oncolytic virus particularly interesting for cancer therapy of what we call cold tumors with moderate to low immune activity.**** \nFinally, Bind as a small technology acquisition provides us with non-particle technology and very timely we had a partnership with them exploring targeted agents in nanoparticle for prostate cancer. One of those agents seems to do very well, preclinical [indiscernible] studies would Xtandi, so we were delighted as these two acquisition very timely coincided.\nI would conclude on looking at what's next when it comes to novel science and medical entities in 2017 and 2018. We are taking the next step in immune-oncology, moving the field from monotherapy to doublet and triplets and you can see there is old cohort what we think are really unique doublets and triplets with opportunity to be industry-leading in this next step of immune-oncology. We expect upto three Gene30 [ph] clinical trials going in this time period. About 10 different Phase 2 studies with next-generation JAK inhibitors across derm, rheum, and GI segments. And with vaccines, I'll end and say not yet C. difficile that we will now plan in regulatory discussions to move to Phase 3 during first part of 2017. We hope at the end of 2017 or possibly, earlier 2018, to have a breakthrough like this time of an aureus-V vaccine that we think is unique and can be really important. And finally, we are now in clinical phase with a next-generation of [indiscernible] vaccine covering up to 20 different serotypes.\nI conclude on that and thank you for attention.\nAndrew Baum\nThank you, Mikael. So maybe before we get into a conversation about the individual assets in your portfolio. Help us understand how you're thinking about building out Pfizer oncology from an organic basis from an R&D function because within your business you have the vaccines part, the small molecule part, biologics part, you have remap [ph] on the antibody engineering; and yet you're dealing from an immunotherapy perspective, if we believe all roads lead to Rome. Highly complex system to understand why some humans are not immune responsive, how to make achievements; and it's going to enroll carefully-timed together across the organization, lots of different parts. So are there any structural organizational changes that you think are required or do you feel the current separation that exists within Pfizer is something that is going to stay in this multiple?\nMikael Dolsten\nYou know, you can never be sure about the future but I would say, I think we have a very well aligned strategic structure, and let me say why. So [indiscernible] we have our center for small molecule design in cancer and it's the group that have made all this great targeted agents from XALKORI to fall on Tofacitinib [ph] to IBRANCE and are actually working right now with our next-generation cell cycle inhibitor that will address some of resistance to molecules like IBRANCE off the patients being exposed for years that we hope to having the clinic in within 12 to 15 months.\nIn the San Francisco area, we have our specialized immune-oncology group that have worked on the recent 4-1BB, OX40 check point modulator that brings us into what we think is leading doublet and triplet. Going back to South San Francisco, we have our cancer vaccine door-to-door with our small molecule vaccine. And the cancer vaccine has sold many years built significant capability with two perform, one is the multi-antigen vaccine that is co-administrated with CTLA-4 antibody locally and likely a PD-1 Pfizer antibody systemically. If now we're not filed for prostate cancer, and we see early interesting as signals. And we also have the oncolytic viral platform that they alluded to through a partnership.\nThe third group that is [indiscernible], New York, has deep expertise in functional genomics and help us identify future target that can augment activity of molecules like IBRANCE and can act in synergy with checkpoint blockade. They also are our skill center for antibody drug conjugates and nanoparticles. So I hope you got the sense that each of them have unique skills, each of them are embedded in an academic network, you need to start in the northern California or in the metropolitan [ph], New York, that has been actually instrumental for us. For example, our genomics activity [indiscernible] been in close partnership with [indiscernible] laboratories and we're pulling up some new targets that we do in chemistry honors [ph] that we think can give us in the future if [indiscernible] and cancer metabolic target that when combined with IBRANCE improved the long-lasting cell-killing substantially. So this is the type of network we have put together to tap into the best of science in United States but doing it in a complementary riding and overlapping range.\nAndrew Baum\nSo moving down to the products and if we take the premise that here next 10 to 20 years ago, you have a long-term immunotherapy, if not much longer. And the question is how you get more patients to respond? One area which I know Pfizer has a legacy of investment in is antibody drug conjugates, and which is a map which is now what we're surfacing that I know we went to repair that investment disappointment is. Obviously the most drafted those but I know you have a raft of interesting early stage molecules, so we're talking about the PTK-7 target before we came on. So perhaps you could talk to what you have the advanced tolerability efficacy and then we can sort of segway [ph] into how we can leverage that through combinations with checkpoint blockade?\nMikael Dolsten\nYes, it's a great question. So, you know we have noted in recent team on checkpoint combination studies, that checkpoint modulated by themselves to treat the world in tumors that or what we call hot -- that high-level of PDL1 that maybe -- more than 50% of patients are positive while in corresponding similar lung cancer patients that are low and their efficacies is much more modest. Chemotherapy seems particularly in the \u2013 in this cold tumors, be able to cause cell death and damage that leads to a subsequent immune response and by combining chemo with the immune-blockade you can get probably the best of the two. We thought that going forward, and systemic chemo will overtime be a bit of the past and that's why we are quite excited about antibody drug conjugate because they carry -- in a targeted manner with better tolerability chemo into the tumor.\nAnd I think the data that you mentioned that you observed with PTK7 showed substantial response rate in well advanced ovarian cancer, in the 30% range. Please remember checkpoint inhibitors in this space would show about half at most. We know that the key with checkpoint inhibitors is the long-lasting durability with antibody growth conjugates who get good response rate, better tolerability than systemic-chemo but you are not likely to get that long lasting response. What we have seen with PTK7 and similar construct in a preclinical studies is that tumors that are really cold, you find or [indiscernible] quickly become enriched immune cells going into these immunogenic cell death. And that's why we are very excited at the moment, we are just in the final defined phase, how our PTK7 -- PDL-1 type of trial would look like. And whether we go with PDL-1 only or in additional studies doublet to immune checkpoint inhibitors.\nWe do think -- whether you use ADCs or nanoparticles that are targeted to tumors, filled with selective agent that will have combined and the tumor effect favorable both, immune modulation on the microenvironment, we think that is a really interesting game for cold tumors. While for the hot tumors, we think you probably will do well when you guys double or triple IUIU blockade. So I hope that gave you a sense for how strategically we have placed our best and just -- and for the type of tumors where you have a very poor ability to provoke immune response, initially tumors that have low degree of mutational burden which is required from immune response. Those are the tumors that we will go with CAR-T platform and also with our bifunctional antibodies because you circumvent the need for this mutational burden. And this story is really how we think as Pfizer, we have built immune-oncology platform that will in the future have an ability to target a very comprehensive group of tumor patients, and possibly the most comprehensive availability's standpoint.\nAndrew Baum\nSo on a similar vein as -- but through a different route, increasing number of patients to eminent [ph] responsive. You've obviously now taken extend DNT or portfolio. And you touched upon -- me taking above from the new antigens. I didn't see on your slide an intent to initiate the trial combining with checkpoint blockade but of course, many of your peers have done that, Astrum and others. How are you thinking about that? Where you were targeted? Any thoughts would be interesting.\nMikael Dolsten\nGreat question, and I'll be brief as this agents are new in our portfolio. We -- you know, we have noticed there was actually a study with XTANDI and PDL-1 inhibitor that did show added value to such small studies and this is an area we're now looking actively into, how our checkpoint inhibitors could work with a drug like XTANDI for prostate. I also wanted to mention that Talazoparib that was part of the Medivation acquisitions is used particularly for tumors that have high limitation of burden as support-inhibitor. And we think that asset will do extremely well with our immune-oncology portfolio. So that's another area where we are looking at actively what would be the best strategies for those two asset.\nAndrew Baum\nAnd then in terms of -- and this is again picking up a conversation before we started but perhaps expanding on the side on that sort of \u2013 that GUI [ph] phases of chemotherapy because to end one you may increase an epitope spreading, you may cause immunogenic cell death but on the other hands, you're creating subclonal populations of mutated -- mutations and tumor cells which may in fact move you away from having a favorable effect to chemotherapy. Now obviously, we haven't seen the data but interested in how you're thinking about that -- selecting patient populations using diagnostics noted to try and address that.\nMikael Dolsten\nYes. I think it's a great question and that's why, you know, I think there could be some concern to use chemo IL for tumors that are already immunogenic where you just need to release the brakes for PDL-1. There is enough of the immunogens available and you may not want to cause additional mutations at this stage while for cold tumors you really need to have both immune response. I think overtime there will be more sophisticated approaches than chemo, that's why we're investing in a disease where can deliver a much higher payload into tumor because mutation particular appear when the amount of chemo is insufficient. And that's also what we've added is nanoparticle platform where you can load it with as one or two targeted agents which may be a better way overtime to go than traditional chemo.\nAndrew Baum\nYou have aside from evalamap [ph], you have CD137 for 1PP, you have OX40; so perhaps on OX40, we already saw some early data from Roche in combination with that PDL-1 which was underwhelming, frankly. So -- vast acknowledging differences between molecules and so on. As your scientists have looked for that data and thought about what to take home, what was their conclusions about whether it's dosing, scheduling, indication or molecular -- I'm interested in that. And then just last time, just on the other checkpoints, on CD137, notably it doesn't have the hepatotoxicity which Bristol [ph] has. Is that serve you to -- to the lack of all the diminished effect of function, or is that other differences on the Media type end which make us more likely to contribute to the differential safety efficacy.\nMikael Dolsten\nGreat question and one of my favorite topics. So thank you for bringing it up. Both Both, our 4-1BB, OX40, are designed as IDT-2 antibodies with reduced risk for 788 and cytotoxicity but with great agonist properties. So we think they optimize for signaling through the cells to augment and so staying PDL-1 in used immune responses. We have combined our 4-1BB with avelumab and earlier we combined it also with Keytruda. And data so far, which is early data, we had a little more advanced with Keytruda but data that accumulates suggests to me that this is a productive combination, good tolerability, and seem to do better than the mono PDL-1 from emerging clinical data. I would like to see more to be able to conclude where and how to use it, but I am encouraged what I've seen. OX40 as you said, showed mainly disease stabilization, some senior responses but also confirmed at some biomarkers that it was having a different profile than 4-1BB. So we are planning early next year, you always want to have a good start of the year. Then we are ready to doze to first patient with a triplet of avelumab, 4-1BB and OX40. We think it's the -- from a rational immune design, and from preclinical studies, it has all the bells and whistles to take off the break, augment cytotoxic and helper cell -- immuno cells to play against the tumor.\nThe second kind of doublets and triplets platform we have is Avelumab, 4-1BB with IDO1. We are right now in clinical studies with our IDO1 inhibitor that we co-discovered with a Belgium biotech company and we think for some tumors that would be a very interesting triplet. We are right now in mono and moving to doublet, hopefully end of 2017 or 2018 we will have triplets. I think both those triplets will be led by Pfizer, that's our aspiration and to the best of my knowledge we are the only company that have internal access to these four different agents, avelumab, 4-1BB, OX40, IDO1.\nAndrew Baum\nAnd presumably, I mean when I look at that first triplet that you mentioned, you've got two active costumers for your molecules and a checkpoint, presumably with those thing, you're going to start very, very, very low because of the tox risk, so that will take a while to find the dose before you can -- is that the right way of thinking about it?\nMikael Dolsten\nIt is a very thoughtful question. We are planning to define on pieces here. I don't think we need to start death low because we have doublet data on both of them; doublet of various combination of avelumab, 4-1BB and OX40. Each of them have shown good tolerability. So I don't think we need to start that some ultra-low and should be able to doze escalate but in principle you're right, there are a number of doze step you need to take. But we certainly June 2017 to be able to get an early read on the clinical activity, across the spectrum of tumors and then moving to dose expansion cohort in specific tumor types.\nAndrew Baum\nAnd you high costs molecule, is that in the clinic or about to go into the clinic?\nMikael Dolsten\nThe one that's next to go into the clinic for us is likely going to be a getter [ph] molecule. It's going to be like in the clinic second half of 2017, it adds to our [indiscernible] and offers another opportunity next to OX40 to target regulatory components of the immune system.\nAndrew Baum\nAnd this is from Rinat?\nMikael Dolsten\nIt's also from Rinat.\nAndrew Baum\nGot it, okay.\nMikael Dolsten\nRinat leads our checkpoint modulators and also to get with selective, have a capability for CAR-T cells that we are producing there. As you know we're on clinical studies with our new CAR-19. It's an allogeneic platforms so you don't need all these cumbersome, one patient, one harvests, one infusion; you can create an off-the-shelf product. The second indication that we're hoping -- 12 to 15 months or so to going to will be in myeloma with another CAR-T. Again, allogen 8 [ph] unique, likely first in the industry for both of them.\nAndrew Baum\nSegueing away from immune-oncology just for a second, could we talk about CDK 4/6.\nMikael Dolsten\nYes.\nAndrew Baum\nWell, obviously you are the industry leader and with that -- with that we have made huge impact already on the disease. The competition is maturing, now with Lilly and with Novartis. I'd like to get your impression of how much the competitive threat from a scientific safety efficacy point of view you see because frankly, we saw a drug which is going -- hepatotoxicity of QTC and is late, but I'm -- I'd be interested in whether you've seen hepatotoxicity anywhere approaching what was seen in the clinical trial with IBRANCE. There is no QTC, we know that. And then if you could comment on Novartis's comments, that they believe they will be first to market with the faslodex combination. How much do you think that's really going to change the competitive landscape, given the faslodex may become more the gold standard for managing of these patients and remind us where you are with a faslodex combination.\nMikael Dolsten\nYes, I think you summarized rivocycline [ph] but did anyone else, when you said it's late into the market with liver and cardiac rates report that's adverse events. That's me quote you, not me stating you. Our Drug as being you know, now used by 40,000 breast cancer patients. It's you know based on Paloma 2 and 3, answer yes. You know really good efficacy, it is well tolerate. Patience seems to report good life quality. That's been some monitoring for mutual feels, but clinically the patient seems to have few problems and we have not seen, this type of issues that you reported from Novartis as being part of our profiles to any significant extend. We think that the molecule has been out in the market very well perceived by physicians and patients. Established market share for as far second line exceeding 40%. And it gives us a very strong position. We are leaders when it comes to breast cancer which is adjuvant therapy to cure patients. Of course we delayed the risk of a recurrence, where we have two studies going, Penelope and Palas [ph] that we will looking forward around 2020.\nThen we have combination studies in breast with a PSD-K inhibitor, we're running a few studies in other tumor types, head and neck, the pancreas, subset of full mandatory, we expect some data to share in 2017 and 2018. And then I already mention that we will put in 12 to 15 months or so, to have another sieve cycle inhibitor that can deal with resistance that inevitably unfortunately cure patients being on talk [ph] to drugs. And we have also developed a insights on how CDK 4/6 inhibitor. And move cancer cells to senescence but they take a long time before they go from 18 to cell death [ph]. And we have identified the vulnerabilities and a planning a you know, to also address additional drugs.\nSo I just did that journey to give you a sense of a clinical extremely strong position, breast cancer, early breast cancer or beyond breast and future combinations based on our insight. Convective first predicts that, which is the name for Fulvestrant. And we actually had date on Fulvestrant in our PALOMA-3 studies while our PALOMA-2 was based on letrosome [ph]. And (IBRANCE) combined very well with Fulvestrant.\nAndrew Baum\nBut in terms of the registration trial with Fulvestrant.\nMikael Dolsten\nI think Fulvestrant is a brand name -- that\u2019s label template provided that they thought recurrent breast cancer is including Fulvestrant to AstraZeneca intramuscular given drug\u2026\nAndrew Baum\nBut that was the drug used in the trial?\nMikael Dolsten\nThat was the drug used in PLAOMA-3 trial, letrozole used in PALOMA-1 and 2. We have additional trials looking at other hormonal blockade including combined -- compared to chemo for certain patient type of study quote.\nAndrew Baum\nSo -- we are going to be running out of time very shortly but one question I wanted to ask is, given Christmas is around the corner and when you're thinking about your wish list for 2017 in terms of business development; what areas you thinking in terms of either platforms or therapeutic areas; I mean you can be -- as I'm sure you won't be specific but any indication you can give of why you think you would like to bolster your organic competences. I'm sure the audience would find interesting.\nMikael Dolsten\nYes, okay, I'm reading -- I was thinking to just have a less ambitious Christmas gift and maybe that's a New Year, and thinking about what drugs do the portfolio. On one I would say we will continue to have appetite for our strategic investment areas. Right now I think we have a very comprehensive immune-oncology portfolio but we would always built and if there is a new agent appearing, you may have seen that we have invested recently in -- novel -- see, there are four construct that are aimed to be local active in the tumor to circumvent that systemic talks seen with [indiscernible]. We have two collaboration on Bioathlon [ph]. So that would be an example of novelties. Strong checkpoint modulators that to better we're active locally than systemic [indiscernible] is one example.\nWe have invested quite a lot in Gene's therapy, we have spectacular data to get with our Islamic song vote. Please check out the (NYSE:ASH) presentation, it's just spectacular, nine patients where you can give them synthetic factor 9 of any that down. Intense affected 9 that makes them independent of any further infusion while previously were dependent on infusions. And we're going to Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy, it would love to see us being able to change fatal outcomes for boys with that disease and we'll certainly keep our eyes open if there is another gene therapist as we have one of the -- I think best manufacturing facilities for clinical studies. Maybe you know, I should end to say that there are certain new science area; one is Nash in the metabolic space, we have, you could see last slide we have two clinical phase, KHK inhibitor and an ACC inhibitor, certainly that's -- I think a novel exciting space.\nOne of the few areas of metabolic disease where you could come to market without big outcome studies and I think it would be a disappointment if I didn't mention that you will always be open on your eyes for breakthroughs in neurological diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and then it's going to be a combination therapy. Maybe, new agents that deal with newer inflammation which seems to be a major culprit, that would be nice New Year's gifts. So I'm opening in the corridor for anyone that have a good suggestion of how we make the New Year's gift list comes through for -- and in myself -- and we love to have good tips. Thank you for listening in today.\nAndrew Baum\nI don't think I can say anything better. Listen, many thanks Mikael for joining us, thank you for the audience today and if you have further doubts, please don't hesitate to reach out. Many thanks.\nMikael Dolsten\nVery pleasant to talk to you thank.\nAndrew Baum\nLikewise.\n\n",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our discipline and successful execution in 2005 led to very robust performance of the core business, resulting in strong revenue and bottom-line growth, despite a challenging year. In 2006 we anticipate major approvals for Rituxan in rheumatoid arthritis and Tysabri in multiple sclerosis. Let me expand on these few points. In 2005 we posted revenues exceeding $2.4 billion, which was topline growth of about 10%; non-GAAP net income of 554 million, which represented 12% growth over the prior year. Revenue performance was driven by Rituxan and Avonex. Rituxan is the number-one selling therapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and is now a $3.4 billion global brand. It is growing 16% in the U.S. and over 50% outside the U.S. In rheumatoid arthritis, the sales force has been fully hired. The action date is the end of this month. We and our partner Genentech are prepared to launch Rituxan for rheumatoid arthritis as soon as it is approved.\nFor 10 continuous years, Avonex has been the number-one prescribed therapy for MS worldwide. Avonex is a $1.5 billion brand. Over 135,000 patients worldwide choose Avonex for its lasting efficacy and convenience. Our international business now exceeds $600 million, growing 22% year-over-year. In Europe, Avonex has taken share in virtually every market. We completed our restructuring and have a platform for growth in 2006 with opportunities for Rituxan in RA and Tysabri for MS. The past year has certainly been an interesting year, and it didn't exactly unfold as it started. I will review the year here quickly.\nSuspension of Tysabri made 2005 very challenging indeed. The emergence of PML in association with Tysabri treatment was a serious and unexpected finding that led to the suspension of Tysabri. Subsequent safety review required a lot of work and significant expenditure of resources as we went through the year. We completed what we needed to do on the Tysabri work with the safety investigations. We completed the two-year trials and then filed the supplemental BLA at the end of September. With the prior review designation, the PDUFA date for Tysabri's sBLA is in late March, and the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Advisory Committee is scheduled for March 7.\nDue to the dozens of patients that have signed up to speak during the public session, the FDA has notified us that the meeting will extend into a second day to allow for a longer session of public testimony. Given the high interest in this event, we expect trading of Biogen Idec stock on NASDAQ to be halted during the Advisory Committee. We look forward to this next step in the process toward making Tysabri once again available to MS patients. But beyond Tysabri, numerous other things were going on in the Company. The Rituxan RA stage three trials finished up in April, and we filed the supplemental BLA in the third quarter. The PDUFA date is coming up in a couple weeks at the end of February, and we're very optimistic about this opportunity.\nWe also filed a label extension for Rituxan in front-line aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and just last week the FDA granted this label expansion. As part of our overall plan to expand that label, we will be filing for indolent, front-line and maintenance use, and that's on track for the first half of 2006. As we looked at the business in the wake of Tysabri and what was going to be required here, we sold a couple of assets, including the large-scale manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California. We decided we would divest Amevive, and we're in the process of divesting that product. We also made a number of other moves, including restructuring the Company, and in doing so created a lot of P&L space for us to take advantage of external growth.\nWe recognize the need to increase our long-term growth prospects by significantly augmenting the number of programs in our mid to late-stage pipeline. The PDL collaboration for three products which fit across our key therapeutic areas is an example of the type of deals we seek to pursue to enhance our pipeline. We have earmarked approximately $200 million a year for business development and external research opportunities, starting in 2006, and that compares to approximately $50 million earmarked for business development in 2005. The operating cash flow of our business over the past year exceeded $800 million. We essentially have a debt-free balance sheet, so we're in a strong financial position with great cash flow to the business and a good foundation to start with. Now I would like to turn the call over to Bert Adelman. Burt?\nBurt Adelman, Executive Vice President of Development\nThank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to take you through our pipeline, and the format that I'm going to use is to divide the pipeline into our key strategic business units, neurology, rheumatologic disease and oncology, and start with our most advanced programs and then give you some insight into our earlier development activities in each of these areas. So, beginning with our neurology franchise, and beginning with Tysabri, taking up from where Jim left off. As many of you are already aware, today the FDA informed us that clinical trial dosing for Tysabri in patients with multiple sclerosis can resume. And in these regards, we expect to begin dosing in an open-label multicenter safety extension study of Tysabri as monotherapy in patients with relapsing forms of MS. This will be in the United States under the IND.\nSimultaneously, we are in active discussions with European regulatory agencies to reinitiate dosing at those sites in Europe that participated in the Phase III trials, also as an open-label extension study of Tysabri as monotherapy. The patients, obviously, who will be eligible for these trials are those individuals who previously participated in the Phase III MS program. We already know that a very high percentage of these patients have indicated a strong interest in participating in these trials, so we expect that accrual will be excellent. Now, I'm not going to discuss the protocol in detail. I'll give you a heads up on that, because this news is brand-new, and we believe that it is appropriate for us to first communicate directly with our investigative sites, and they with the patients, how the study will be run. But obviously, as I've said, this will be a monotherapy trial, and we will be using this as another opportunity to learn as much as we can about testing for PML. So we will be drawing blood from patients to do various tests to continue to learn how best to understand the risk of PML.\nJim has already told you that the Advisory Committee meeting will be extended through March 7th and into March 8th because of the overwhelming patient and patient group interest. We're preparing for that and we look forward to the opportunity to discuss all that we have done to bring Tysabri back to patients in this important forum. In addition, as the regulatory process is moving forward for Tysabri in the United States, it is also actively moving forward in Europe, and we are working closely with the CPMP in our effort to bring Tysabri to the market for relapsing forms of MS in Europe.\nNow I will move on to Rituxan. I'm sure many of you know that we have, along with our partners at Genentech, an exciting program looking at Rituxan in both primary progressive and relapsing forms of MS. The Phase III primary progressive trial, which is called Limpus (phonetic) is completely enrolled. However, it will be sometime before we see the data, as the primary endpoint of that study is a two-year EDSS disability endpoint. The Phase II relapsing-remitting trial has also completed enrollment, and we expect to have results of that trial sometime during the first half of 2007.\nNow, we've already told you about the important progress we've made in our BG-12 oral fumarate program. I'll just very briefly repeat that we announced in January that this oral compound had met the primary endpoint of a Phase II MS trial. The data around these results will be presented at a future medical meeting, and I actually don't know what that venue will be. But we are working actively with our partners and with regulatory authorities to define the path forward for BG-12 in MS. At the same time, we are in discussions with the regulatory agencies in Germany regarding the BG-12 file in psoriasis.\nDaclizumab, the antibody to the IL-2 receptor, which we've partnered with PDL, is currently in a clinical trial in MS, and we are working hard to develop ongoing Phase II MS trials for Daclizumab as monotherapy and as combination therapy. Hopefully, we will be starting the monotherapy trial during this summer. And finally, our oral A2A antagonist program in Parkinson's disease, in collaboration with Vernalis, will hopefully move into Phase II sometime this year.\nNow moving on to our oncology franchise, as Jim already mentioned to you, we are very happy to be able to announce that the FDA approved an expansion in the Rituxan label to include up-front therapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and we are happy that the FDA has enabled us to bring this important therapeutic approach to patients with aggressive forms of B-cell lymphoma. We also anticipate filing Rituxan for indolent front-line and maintenance therapies sometime in the first half of '06, and we believe that these are very strong data supported by trial results from our front-line Rituxan CVP, Cytoxan, vincristine and prednisone trial, and the ECOG 1496 trial. These supplements will enable us to expand the label for Rituxan across the spectrum of indications for which well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated its important efficacy. We're also just to finish on Rituxan, we also continue to accrue patients into a relapse chronic lymphocytic leukemia trial in Europe and the U.S.\nNow, moving on to Zevalin, we have submitted to the FDA our Phase III protocol for Zevalin as a component of therapy to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. And we hope to initiate that trial in collaboration with our partner Schering AG sometime during the second half of 2006. Our Anti-CD80 program, we have decided to move this antibody into a Phase III trial for relapse low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and we hope to start accruing patients sometime in the second half of the year.\nFinally, our very exciting early program, the M200 program, an antibody program partnered with PDL that is directed against a protein necessary to facilitate angiogenesis in the site of a tumor bed; we'll be taking that program into a series of open-label pilot Phase II trials, and we look to some important data over the next year or two in this program. There will be some abstracts submitted to ASCO, so hopefully we'll have some exciting data even this year at ASCO. Our anti-lymphotoxin beta receptor program is in Phase I in solid tumors, colorectal and lung, and our adeno-interferon beta gene therapy program continues to be evaluated as an IV form in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and liver metastases.\nAnd finally, the list is getting long. And finally, our Phase II anti-CD23 program in CLL is maturing, in that we are collecting the last of the data in that trial, and hopefully by midyear we will be able to make a decision as to whether we're moving that program into late Phase II or early Phase III.\nNow, to move on to our new therapeutic area, rheumatologic disease. Obviously, everyone is aware of our plans for Rituxan. The history is well-known. We completed a large Phase III trial. It was submitted to the FDA in August. It was granted prior to review. And the expected action date from the FDA will be toward the end of February. And this first indication for Rituxan is in the TNF inadequate responder group.\nAt the same time, we have an extensive program to define the value of Rituxan in retreatment. We are looking at joint erosion data, and we have initiated a large Phase III program for Rituxan in DMARD inadequate responders. We'll also initiating trials of Rituxan in Lupus, an obviously very serious autoimmune disease with very limited therapeutic options for patients. So we're very excited about that program. We do have some interesting early Phase I, Phase II data to suggest that there is an important D-cell component to Lupus that can be accessed by Rituxan therapy. The second generation CD20 program, there will be some results coming up shortly in the Phase II rheumatoid arthritis trial, and we will share them with you when we have them available to us.\nFinally, two final early programs, lymphotoxin beta receptor program. We've begun enrolling in a Phase II RA study for D-Mard inadequate responders with that fusion protein. And in collaboration with PDL, we've begun enrollment in a Phase II RA program using the HuZAF anti-interferon gamma antibody strategy. So, to recap expected 2006 milestones, we're hoping to file six INDs, three are for new molecular entities. The anti BR3 in CLL in conjunction with our colleagues at Genentech. This is part of our expanding portfolio of therapies directed against B-cells, both in malignancy and autoimmune disease. Neublastin for neuropathy pain and the alpha-b beta 6 antibody for interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Finally, obviously, we're looking forward to hearing the results of the Rituxan regulatory process by the end of February, and submitting the Rituxan front-line low-grade and maintenance in the first half of the year, and of course, Tysabri in the U.S. and Europe. Thanks, and I'll now hand the mic over to Peter.\nPeter Kellogg, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Burt. Before I move on to the financials, let me remind everyone that we provide table three of our earnings release as a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. Because we recognize the importance of earnings computed in accordance with GAAP, and in accordance with Regulation G, I'd like to remind you that on table three in our press release, we reconcile our GAAP P&L to the adjusted non-GAAP performance that we discuss. This is presented in a tabular manner and breaks out the reconciliation by major driver and by P&L line item.\nThe main items excluded from operating non-GAAP EPS in Q4 were, as always, we adjust the purchase accounting charges, which were $74 million for the amortization of intangibles, and $5 million in stepped up inventory value in the cost of sales line. Secondly, we have written down $36 million of Amevive inventory, based on the anticipated sale of that business. Third, we had severance and restructuring charges of $12 million, which are the fourth quarter's impact from our 2005 restructuring and organizational changes that you have all heard about previously. Fourth, we recorded an impairment loss on sale of assets of $15 million, driven by the anticipated sale of the NICO clinical manufacturing plant, based on current negotiations with potential buyers. And finally, in addition to the normal tax effect on these items, we have also incurred a onetime tax charge of $11 million due to the repatriation of approximately $196 million in foreign earnings, of which $175 million was repatriated at the reduced tax rate under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.\nNow, as normal, I will review the P&L operating performance of Biogen Idec and will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP P&L, driven by the reconciliation in table 3. We believe this P&L better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of our integrated business. Let me begin first by making a few observations about the full-year 2005 P&L performance. We ended the year with 10% total revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS growth of 12%. And as Jim mentioned earlier, some of the key highlights of the year include the fact that total Avonex worldwide sales grew 9%. Internationally, Avonex grew 22%, and as Jim mentioned, is now over $600 million in sales, quite an accomplishment for this high-performing operation.\nOur Rituxan business continues its strong double-digit growth. In 2005 it grew 15%, despite heavy investment in rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune trials, and in the buildup of the RA sales infrastructure at year-end. Finally, we've accomplished these strong results in a year that required a lot of discipline in managing our costs. We maintained our topline momentum, we've done the homework on Tysabri, we delivered double-digit EPS growth, and we restructured the Company for external growth. So, quite a full-year.\nNow, let's move through the fourth-quarter P&L results, beginning with revenue. In the fourth quarter, our total revenue was $633 million, 8% growth over the same period last year. Breaking out the product revenues, starting with Avonex, which is the number-one MS product worldwide now in its 10th year on the market. In the fourth quarter, Avonex worldwide sales were $413 million. In the U.S. the Avonex product sales were $242 million. Despite losing some market share in the first half of 2005, we're very pleased that Avonex has regained some of those losses and remains the market leader in the U.S.\nOn the international front, our fourth-quarter Avonex product sales outside the U.S. were $172 million, up 24% year-over-year. Avonex's fourth-quarter international sales in local currency was 28%. The corresponding ForEx impact in Q4 was negative at roughly $5 million, or a 4 point negative impact on growth. Net, Avonex had a very strong quarter internationally, driven primarily by its consistent messaging of long-term efficacy and low neutralizing antibodies. Most importantly, on a patient share basis, Avonex continues to be the most used international MS therapy. We estimate our leading international market share to be in the low 30s, with Rebif, Betaseron and Copaxone falling behind. In addition, we continue to gain market share internationally in all of our direct markets, and are growing slightly faster than the overall MS market.\nTurning to Amevive, in the fourth quarter the Amevive product sales were $12 million. Zevalin had fourth-quarter product sales of $4 million. And as a reminder, you will recall that in the fourth quarter of last year, which we're lapping, we included $4 million of international deferred revenue from our distribution partner Schering AG. So, the Zevalin performance in Q4 is lapping a big quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, Tysabri product sales were actually -$200,000, and as was the case in the prior quarter, you may recall this represents the amortization of certain product approval milestone payments and credits amortized over the life of the patent of Tysabri.\nOur royalties in the fourth quarter were $22 million, and this takes us to our revenues from unconsolidated joint business. Now, on a full-year basis in 2005, as I mentioned earlier, the revenues in this line were $709 million, up 15%. In the fourth quarter, our revenue from unconsolidated joint business was $182 million, an increase of 6%. As we always discuss, this number has several elements. First, we receive our share of the U.S. Rituxan profits. U.S. Rituxan sales were $484 million in the fourth quarter, up a healthy 13%. And our fourth-quarter profit share from that business was $128 million, up 9% versus prior year. So please note that the profit share growth of 9% was clearly impacted by the collaboration's continued investment in the Rituxan RA opportunity, both in developmental trials and commercial buildup for the RA sales infrastructure in the fourth quarter.\nSecondly, we receive royalty revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the US, and in Q4 this was $42 million, up 24% versus prior year, driven by the impressive growth of, internationally. Third, we are reimbursed for selling and development costs incurred related to Rituxan. This was $12 million in Q4. Please note that this was $20 million last year, and this reduced level of reimbursement this year also contributed to the lower overall growth rate on the unconsolidated joint business line in Q4. Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L, in the fourth quarter our cost of sales were $72 million, 11% of revenue. Our fourth-quarter R&D was $168 million, or 27% of revenue. You'll notice that our R&D in the fourth quarter was down considerably from the third quarter, but please recall that in the third quarter we incurred $50 million for the initiation of the PDL collaboration.\nIn the fourth quarter our SG&A line was $158 million, or 25% of revenue. And in the fourth quarter our OIE line was $12 million. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 33%, which leads us to a full-year tax rate of 31%, in line with prior guidance. And our fourth-quarter diluted shares outstanding for calculating EPS was 345 million shares, which brings us to our fourth-quarter adjusted non-GAAP EPS of $0.48 per share. And on a full-year basis, our 2005 adjusted non-GAAP EPS is $1.57, a 12% increase over prior year. Now I'd just like to touch on a couple of other finance topics, before I hand back to Jim. First let me talk about 2006 guidance.\nI would just like to again reiterate that our P&L outlook for 2006 has not changed since the third quarter, when we announced the expected financial guidance to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.10 non-GAAP EPS. This does not include the impact of FAS 123R. With respect to the implementation of FAS 123R, please note that this will begin in Q1 2006, but we do not plan to apply FAS 123R retrospectively, so the GAAP income statement for 2006 and subsequent years will not be completely comparable to 2005 and earlier years.\nSecondly, the implementation of FAS 123R creates an incremental charge to our GAAP P&L related to the expensing of stock options based on the Black-Scholes valuation methodology. We estimate that this FAS 123R impact for the expensing of stock options in 2006 will be in the order of $0.06 to $0.09 per share. These charges will be distributed across the R&D and SG&A lines of the GAAP P&L. Going forward, our current plan is to communicate our financial results with and without stock option expensing, so you will be able to view the numbers both ways. We have updated our capital spending estimate for 2006. We expect it to be in the range of the 190 million to $275 million, which is a slight change to what we announced on the Q3 earnings call; we basically adjusted the lower-end of that range.\nIn the area of share repurchase, we maintain an ongoing stock repurchase program with the board authorization to buy up to 20 million shares through October of 2006. Now, during 2005 we purchased approximately 8 million shares under the program. Just fewer than 12 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this program. That's it for the financials. Now I would like to hand back to Jim Mullen for some closing remarks. Jim?\nJim Mullen, Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Peter. In 2005 we took several bold and disciplined decisions to redirect our long-term future. Over the last 12 months, we proved our resiliency. For 2006, we expect continued growth of our core business for the expansion of Rituxan into RA and the approval of Tysabri in MS in the U.S. and year. Together these major approvals will provide a platform for Biogen Idec to continue to seek partnerships and collaborations that will further our mission. In addition, we have the resources to develop our promising internal pipeline. While we focus on achieving these vital milestones, we will continue to maintain fiscal discipline. Thank you, and I will now turn the call to Elizabeth for questions and answers.\nElizabeth Woo, Vice President of Investor Relations\nThanks, James. We're ready to begin the Q&A session, and I would ask participants to ask one question and one question only, and to reenter the queue if you have subsequent follow-up questions, to allow more of your colleagues to be able to ask their questions. With that, operator, please open the line for the first question.\nQuestions-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nAnd at this time I would like to remind everyone if you would like to ask a question please press * and the number 1 on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from Adam Walsh with Jefferies & Company\nQ - Adam Walsh\nHi. It's actually regarding the Tysabri trials in the mess that will begin soon. I was just wondering how will you monitor these patients for PML, and will Tysabri-naive patients be eligible to enter the trial in the future?\nA - Burt Adelman\nThis is Burt, thanks. First of all, as I said this is a trial, it's an open-label safety trial for patients who were in the Phase III program. Obviously, there will be other studies of various kinds that will be available for naive patients, but this study going forward is for patients that were already part of our clinical development program. We are evaluating, with respect to PML, we are reevaluating a whole series of potential approaches, most of which are based around using PCR-based assays to look for evidence of JC virus DNA in plasma, serum or perhaps associated with buffy-coat cells. That's the most advanced technology. That technology is used clinically to make the diagnosis on CSF specimens or tissue specimens. So we are basing our strategies on the use of that technology.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of M. Ian Somaiya with Thomas Weisel Partners.\nQ - Ian Somaiya\nHi, thanks for taking my question, just a follow-up. Maybe specifically, did the FDA ask for any sort of specific monitoring techniques or frequency in terms of how frequently the patient should be monitored for PML or JC virus in these open-label studies? How do they correlate with some of the recommendations you might have made in your filing for the drug?\nA - Burt Adelman\nA clinical trial is different than the commercial environment. As we have discussed, there will be a risk map as part of the overall strategy for bringing the product back into the market. I won't discuss the details of the risk map now until all of that is fully worked out with our colleagues at the FDA. Clinical trial manages risk through defined inclusion exclusion criteria, so we'll be deciding patient eligibility based upon that. As I said already, we will undoubtedly be continuing to examine the usefulness of plasma, serum and buffycoat-based PCR assays for the presence of JC virus. But I'm not going to go into any greater detail at this point in time, because this is new news, and we believe the appropriate first audience for this information are the investigators who will be accruing patients into this trial, and ultimately the patients. And perhaps at a later date we will be able to discuss trial designs and findings.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Lazard Freres & Company LLC.\nQ - Joel Sendek\nThanks. Without really describing the trial design or anything, can you tell us whether you are going to have an efficacy endpoint on the open-label study, or if it will only be safety?\nA - Burt Adelman\nYou know, I would say that this is an open-label study where all patients are receiving treatment, so it will be difficult to actually have strict efficacy outcomes. This is not an efficacy-based study. This is primarily an open-label safety extension study.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Bear Stearns.\nQ - Mark Schoenebaum\nHi, thanks very much. Maybe I missed this; can you give us ex-U.S. Avonex market share now, and how that's changed year-over-year? And also, can you refresh us on the market share data for U.S., please?\nA - Peter Kellogg\nSure, thank you Mark. So, outside the U.S., obviously, as you know, we have to do some triangulation. We estimate our market share to be in the low 30s, very low 30s in terms of percentage. And quite frankly, the other two interferon products are just behind us, not too far behind. So the three are pretty close, and Copaxone follows that. In the U.S., our market share is roughly 40%. And again, we are the market leader in the U.S.. In the U.S., obviously, that's based on self-reported sales that all the companies do, so it's pretty closely triangulates to the IMS data that you see, but it is the final shipments that we also all have to report back to IMS. But I don't think it's usually available to normal sources.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Maykin Ho with Goldman Sachs\nQ - Maykin Ho\nHi, based on what you have indicated about the extension study, right now it's only with monotherapy. Is the FDA concerned about the combination in terms of the risk profile? And if indeed that's true, and Tysabri reenters the market with just monotherapy indication, how should one use it? Because the refractory patients, obviously, have been treated mostly with combination therapy.\nA - Burt Adelman\nHi, May-Kin, thanks. Again, I'm not going to go into detail about label negotiations that are ongoing, but what I will say is that we have incredibly strong data supporting the efficacy of Tysabri as monotherapy in patients with relapsing forms of MS. We believe that the mechanism of action of Tysabri is relevant at all times, at all stages, in all patients who have relapsing forms of MS. So I think that our belief is that the biologic relevancy of Tysabri is strong at all points in the course of relapsing MS.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein.\nQ - Geoffrey Porges\nOkay, just a followup. Burt, on something you said earlier. You mentioned other trials being initiated later in the year. Could you give us a sense of what type of trials we should expect from you? Would you be looking at more treatment-experienced patient population, safety studies, or would they have efficacy endpoints as well? What would that look like?\nA - Burt Adelman\nI would say all of those are possibilities. Obviously, we are waiting anxiously to complete our label negotiations with the FDA and the EMEA, and undoubtedly there will be some post-approval requirements. So those will form the basis, probably, of any ongoing clinical development program.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Craig Parker with Lehman Brothers.\nQ - Craig Parker\nHi, Burt, this is not a backdoor way to ask about the safety study, but I'm interested in a broader question, your thoughts on alternative dose and schedule strategies with Tysabri, both lower dose, less treatment dosing, or perhaps even drug holidays.\nA - Burt Adelman\nYeah, we're thinking about all of those. They're appropriate questions. I will say that the general thinking about developing antibodies to integrin receptors, be it Tysabri, or say ReoPro. Our sense has always been that to get any level of efficacy, you have to saturate the receptors at somewhere between a 70 to 80% level. So if you reduce, it's almost a yes/no phenomenon. So if you drop the dose, you probably lose all the efficacy, rather than sort of have a graded loss of efficacy. So we don't believe that alternative dosing strategies would make a lot of sense, because right now we know the efficacy profile. Now, whether or not drug holidays might make sense, that's an interesting question. And fortunately we have a portfolio of product opportunities to treat relapsing forms of MS with, and it may well be a logical approach to treatment to consider having patients on one treatment for some period of time, and then moving to another treatment. So I think the good news is that we've got just the kind of portfolio of approved and products in development to address that kind question.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with SG Cowen.\nQ - Eric Schmidt\nGood afternoon. Peter, I think your partners at Elan have made a comment as to the sales levels with Tysabri you need to achieve in order for the collaboration to be profitable. Could you just give us your views on that?\nA - Peter Kellogg\nHi, Eric. Actually, I'm not going to disagree with them, per se. We usually don't break out our product lines' breakeven points and all that. Obviously, in our launch here we're spending more money than we likely will have as revenues. That's always our standard watch-out. And of course, how we spend money against the program will be a function of how it develops, obviously. So, if this thing continues to be really exciting, then we will obviously pretty well. Elan and Biogen Idec work together very closely in the collaboration. We have joint committees for all the different areas, and we sort out a budget together and work closely. So we are not going to disagree with anything Elan laid out. Elan, obviously, does by a little more information on Tysabri as it's one of their core products. And so we generally don't try to get into talking about product's P&Ls at this point.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of David Witzke with Banc of America Securities.\nQ - David Witzke\nYeah, thanks. Question regarding Avonex pricing. I believe the last increase was 8% last May. How should we think about timing, and if you can, magnitude of increase in U.S. this year? Then I guess, ex-U.S., what's the competitive intelligence on BioPartners on generic beta and when that could be on the market, and how that could change pricing dynamic in Europe? Thank you.\nA - Peter Kellogg\nOkay, Dave this is Peter. Let me take the first part of that question, and for BioPartners maybe I'll pass it over to Jim. It's kind of more of a speculative question really. In terms of pricing in the U.S. for Avonex, I'm assuming that's what you were talking about. We did take a price increase in December of 9%. So that you'll see rolling through our financials going forward. So I think the question is resolved in terms of what's coming forward in that. I'm sure it takes care of things for a while. And quite frankly, that leaves us in a very competitive position with all the other products on the market, with the exception of one which is at a premium to ours, which as you know is Rebif. But the rest are all very closely aligned in terms of pricing when you look at it on a per-year basis. Relative to BioPartners, let me, if I can, turn that over to Jim. That's sort of an open-ended question really, in terms of anything that's been developed worldwide without any influence on pricing.\nA - Jim Mullen\nWell, it's hard to speculate on actually even the dates as to when BioPartners could get a product into the market in Europe. A lot of that will revolve around both what they did from a clinical trial basis, as well as how the Europeans are moving on approval of bio generics. So they have, as you guys all know, recently put out some guidance on a few products. So clearly, they're thinking about it. But they're also very cognizant of matching us in safety efficacy issues. As a practical matter, the trials that the BioPartner has run have been 22 micrograms three times a week. So I don't think we see that actually as a very strong profile coming into the market, but I think the timing that we don't expect it to be very soon.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kantor with RBC Capital Markets.\nQ - Jason Kantor\nHi, thanks. You seem to have a lot of confidence in the Rituxan priority filing, having hired everybody. Could you comment on what if any data you have submitted in the interim, if there's any chance that that gets credited as a major amendment, and how we should be reading into the fact that there is no FDA Advisory Committee for this one?\nA - Burt Adelman\nSo, this is Burt. In answer to the last question, of course, that's entirely up to the FDA. They don't take us into their confidence as to how they decide whether or not to have an Advisory Committee meeting. But I would assume that they felt the package was strong, and that the issues were pretty clear, and the intention of the companies and how to use the product seemed very appropriate and in line with the safety and efficacy data that we had. We haven't changed our guidance to you about the PDUFA date and our expectation to get a decision from the FDA. So that's how I would answer the first part of the question.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Elise Wang with Citigroup.\nQ - Elise Wang\nThanks. I just wondered if you had a little more elaboration on the guidance for the year. Specifically, I know in the past, the last quarter you mentioned operating expenses would be in the range of 1.4 to 1.5 billion. I did want to get an update on that, as well as any details you can give us in regards to, I believe, again, your partner Elan made some comments about spending levels for Tysabri as a group, and then also in addition to that, what might be spent in the collaboration with Protein Design Labs.\nA - Peter Kellogg\nHi Elise this is peter am going to take that. So, you're right; in the third-quarter earnings call we gave a range for operating expenses in our guidance, and that hasn't changed at all. So that's still true. And just as a key point, that covers R&D, SG&A, and it also includes what Jim and I have often referred to as the $200 million that's been set aside for external growth activities. So that's all embedded in that guidance. So basically, on the P&L there's no real update to our guidance at all, so that's still true. Coming to the fourth quarter, I think you can see that makes a lot of sense. Relative to the question of the Tysabri spending for 2006, again, Elan covered a couple of points on that. We always stand back from that and don't get into spending collaboration by collaboration. The PDL spending is embedded in the operating expenses that we've talked about. It is something that we planned for, obviously, as we went through the year, so that's all embedded in the guidance as well for operating expenses. In terms of magnitude of the PDL spending, we don't really, again, break that out. But obviously, we're moving forward with some of the trials and so forth, so there are expenses related to the collaboration, and that's all been baked into our R&D thinking. So basically, at this point I think we are really on course. We did a lot of work this year, restructuring some of our costs, looking at some of the strategic assets that we had or assets that we decided were not strategic. And we've been in the process of selling some of those off. And I think it sets us up in a really good position to drive into '06. Jim, do you have any other comments there?\nA - Jim Mullen\nYes, just a comment. The reason we don't go through trying to break out each program is we don't find that to be terribly valuable. We're managing the whole business. You can see what occurred last year. We react to the product events that are in front of us. Some of them turn out to go one way, others go the other way. We're going to manage that very actively as we go through the year, so I don't see that there's a lot of value in us parsing out in great detail what we think is going to be the spending on a program when we're sitting here in early February. What we do have fairly high confidence is that we will be able to advance our internal programs and all those in collaboration, and that we've got sufficient money and resources to do so. And we've got a very active and robust pipeline. And it advanced very nicely last year, and we expect good progress this year, as well as to put a few more products into that pipeline.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Ende with Merrill Lynch.\nQ - Eric Ende\nThanks for taking my question. With respect to Rituxan in RA, I'm assuming you guys have extensively reviewed the Orencia data at this point, and the amount of data that they have. I was wondering if you guys can kind of go through and compare the amount of data that you guys have relative to what Bristol submitted for Orencia, with respect to really the safety side as well as retreatment. So in other words, really the number of patients that you have at different points in time for each of those.\nA - Burt Adelman\nEric, this is Burt. I don't think I've got all of those numbers in my head, but what I will say, we are looking for an initial indication in TNF refractory patients, and we ran a fairly large trial there. In the context of the 120-day safety review, we were able to submit additional data on patients who have received retreatment. And we have a very extensive safety database from the use of Rituxan for many years in oncology. So, I think we actually have a bigger safety database that is germane than perhaps even the Orencia database. And we will, obviously, be continuing to update that database because of the extensive ongoing clinical trial program.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Gene Mack with HSBC.\nQ - Gene Mack\nHi, thank you for taking the question. First, I was just wondering if there any in the agreement with Elan, do you have any sort of best efforts criteria in the U.S. in terms of depending on what kind of label you get, especially if it's something that's where we're going to see use in the front-line, and we need to now start to think about this? Is there a best efforts agreement with Elan that might run counter to your interest with Avonex, given the higher profit margin there? And just real quick, Elan seemed pretty optimistic about starting up a trial or restarting development in Crohn's disease, and I was just wondering if you share that optimism.\nA - Peter Kellogg\nHi Gene, this is Peter. Let me take the first crack at that one. Without getting into details of the contract, clearly, we have spent an enormous amount of money on Tysabri. We have considered it a core part of our MS franchise, as well as one of our really big opportunities to move into Crohn's and other areas. And we and Elan are very much aligned on all details of how we move forward, whether it be the commercial activity or the clinical activity, or the financial commitments we make. So I don't think it's really a topic that is one that needs to the worried about at all. We are extremely committed to moving Tysabri forward and making it a big part of the therapeutic choices in the MS community, and all the other areas where it can be used appropriately. And clearly, we had good Crohn's data that you've seen in the past. So that's another area that we would be moving forward on. What we have done at the collaboration is agreed post-suspension to zero in on getting back in front of the FDA and the EMEA with the MS information and focus on the MS piece first, really get that taken care of, and then to move on to other indications, including Crohn's. So that, clearly, has been the work that we've been doing so far. So it's probably not to say that Crohn's is kind of it's just the more we really zeroed in on getting MS rolling first. And I think we don't, as Jim mentioned earlier, we don't break out all the financial spending and so forth that we do on Tysabri, but I can tell you as the Chief Financial Officer we've spent a whole lot on Tysabri to get it here, and we fully intend to make it a tremendous success. We are very committed. In terms of the contract, there's lots of joint management of this collaboration in the contract, so there's all kinds of areas where we agree on budgets and long-range plans and everything. It's a very close collaboration, and we and Elan are completely locked together on this one in terms of how we look at the opportunity.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Bret Holley with CIBC World Markets.\nQ - Bret Holley\nYeah, hi Burt. I had a question on the extension study. These are prior Phase III patients. And presumably, since the suspension of Tysabri, those patients have been receiving other therapy. And I was just wondering how you're going to handle that in bringing them back onto Tysabri.\nA - Burt Adelman\nRight, so good point. And that is undoubtedly the case. And we will have developed, in collaboration with the FDA in this protocol, an algorithm for patients switching to Tysabri. And I'm sure that it will be something that we will discuss, perhaps in the context of the Advisory Committee meeting. But again, as I said earlier, I'm not going to discuss the details of operating this protocol until we have had an opportunity to make sure that all of our investigators and the eligible patients understand the details directly through us.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Ron Ellis with Prudential.\nQ - Ron Ellis\nJust a question about the panel. You mentioned that it's going to extend into March 8. Do you think that the questions to the panel will be posed on the 7th or the 8th now?\nA - Burt Adelman\nI think the format, the panel gets the questions, obviously, at the beginning of the meeting. And the format, the meeting is being extended to allow for more public presentation. And that comes in between the FDA and the sponsor presentation, and then the actual panel discussion of the list of issues. So, I suspect the discussion of the list of issues will either complete or may not even start until the second day.\nQ - Ron Ellis\nSo then, the stock would be held on both days?\nA - Jim Mullen\nWe expect the stock to be held as long as the Advisory Committee is still in session.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Augustine with Credit Suisse First Boston.\nQ - Mark Augustine\nThank you. I wanted to ask about Q4 results over in Europe with Avonex, because the growth was pretty high relative to where you had been in Q4s over there, so whether it's a reflection of inventory price or any other unusual factors, please let us know. Thanks.\nA - Peter Kellogg\nAlways in the international there's things moving around up and down and so on. There was very strong volume growth, just first of all, just to start. However, a few things that are a little different in Q4 versus Q4 a year ago, just to mention. One of them is, and I think we commented on this during the Q3 earnings call, and that is that as we have reviewed our FIN 46 accounting approach for some of our joint ventures, we concluded over the summer that our joint venture in Italy should go through a FIN 46 consolidation. It should be a consolidated entity. You may recall in Q3, as a result of that, we had slightly lower revenue in Italy, because we pushed these sellthrough points a little further out. In other words, we used to book revenue when we sold into the joint venture, and then once you decide to consolidate that, you book revenue when the joint venture sells the product onto the market. So in Q3 our revenue was slightly suppressed from that. But then in Q4, now we have a full quarter of accounting for the joint venture on a consolidated basis. So that actually helped our revenue, but not a major factor, but that was one kind of anomaly. But we've got very strong volume growth, we have some pricing benefit overseas, and then that's been offset slightly by the foreign exchange. So really it's a very healthy business performance in both the direct markets and the distributor markets around the world. So it's just a great quarter. And I think what we like to look at, because international is complex with all the mix and so on, is we do like to focus on just how we're doing against the competition in terms of market share. And the team overseas has been consistently posting volume growth in excess of the market growth. And they've been gaining share. And that's just great performance, because in a number of markets they compete in, Copaxone was just launched in the last year or two. So to gain market share in that setting is really solid. There's probably not a whole lot more complexity to that. We had a little bit of product sold for some clinical trial activity that's anticipated by another company, but that was very small relative to the overall volume. So basically, a very strong performance really, some pricing benefits, offset a little bit by ForEx.\nElizabeth Woo, Vice President of Investor Relations\nOperator, I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator\nOne last question, your final question comes from the line of Steven Harr with Morgan Stanley. Steven your line is open.\nOkay we will move to Alex Hittle with AG Edwards.\nQ - Alex Hittle\nThank you. I was wondering if you could fill us in on where the pricing now lines up in terms of what comes back to Biogen between a patient who for a year is on Avonex, as opposed to a patient who would be on Tysabri, per the price, before Tysabri was pulled from the market.\nA - Peter Kellogg\nOkay, Alex I will take a shot at that, Peter. Just so you understand, this is a complex question. I think you're saying as a patient is on Avonex versus as a patient is on Tysabri, how does that affect our financials? So let me answer it that way. First of all, Tysabri was launched at a higher price then Avonex, in line with the clinical results that we have crossed, and so it really is first of all not really comparable one-to-one to Avonex. Secondly, it is a new mechanism of action, and the clinical profile I don't need to speak to; I think you've all analyzed it very thoroughly in all of your reports, but very exciting clearly. And I think everybody who looks at that expects us to grow the market considerably. And remember that MS of the patients that one might think would be on therapy, maybe 55% or 50 to 60% of them are actually on therapy. There's a great number of patients who are what we refer to as off therapy or quitters, or in the middle of switching. And they're dissatisfied with the current therapies for a variety of reasons that we've all talked about, whether it be tolerability or a perceived efficacy, or whatever.\nSo, we expect that innovations, what the MS market has been screaming for, clearly, is some form of innovation in terms of a new product. Tysabri was really the first new significant product to be launched into the MS market since 1996 or '97. So a long time since anything major has been launched. And so we really think that Tysabri will be, first of all, a premium product; number two, it will expand the market; and number three, relative to our portfolio. We've shown this many times over the years in different presentations clearly, it's going to expand our portfolio and be very positive for both the top line and the bottom line of Biogen Idec.\nSo we, obviously, looked at that very closely. And likewise we've looked at other products that are potentially coming into the MS area, and we're excited about all of those. We think the MS market is ripe for innovation, and Tysabri is, we think, a major innovation for the market. So we are quite comfortable with all of that.\nElizabeth Woo, Vice President of Investor Relations\nThank you everyone for joining us on the call today.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, we do appreciate your joining us today.

Go ahead, Mr. Oberton.\nWill Oberton\nThank you, Ellen. And thank everybody for joining us today. Also, I thank everybody for the support you have given us over the last several quarters because things have been a little tougher and we are starting to bring it back. I\u2019m very proud to report that we had a nice quarter. The second quarter turned out very well for Fastenal. Our sales are really on track with where we thought they would be.\nIf you recall back to our January conference call, Dan and I talked about the sequential trends and where we thought they would come out. And after the call, we got some people who were cautioning us on being a little bit optimistic, but fortunately they have played out exactly where we thought they would be.\nIf you look at the trend line, I believe five out of six months have been at or above the sequential pattern \u2013 historical sequential pattern. June came in right at 21.1%. At the end of May, we thought maybe June would do a little bit better, but actually it turned out that May was just a blockbuster month. We had a lot of things lined up for us. And so we are not at all disappointed with June. May was just a spectacular month.\nThe sales really were driven by our manufacturing customers, which were up 29.8% for the company \u2013 for the quarter, excuse me. Very, very good pattern. Construction customers did come back just a little bit. They were way down in the first quarter, came back to flat to plus 0.5%. So that\u2019s actually a very positive sign. We don\u2019t see a lot of activity there, but in some of the areas like oil and gas and some of the other more mechanical areas of construction we are seeing some life coming into that business.\nOur active accounts have not been growing the way that we would like them to. They were up 3% for the quarter. We have done a lot of research trying to understand that better, and what we found, it\u2019s really being driven by the lack of actives as being caused by two things. One is that our construction customers, a lot of the residential, which isn\u2019t a big piece of our business, but it\u2019s a big piece of our actives, and the small commercial contractors are just not showing up with the frequency they did at one time. Many of them are just very \u2013 not a lot of business.\nThe other thing that\u2019s hurting our active accounts is that we have opened fewer stores, and new stores have always been one of the greatest drivers of active accounts. So all of the actives were only up 3%. We are pretty comfortable with where we are after we have looked at the data. In the manufacturing side, we had very nice growth in actives and that\u2019s driving that 29.8% growth in manufacturing business.\nGross margins came in at 52.1%, right on track with where we thought they would be. And Dan is going to give a little more color later in the call telling you where the breakdown is, but we are improving in all areas of our business with the gross margin. And we are comfortable that that trend will continue going forward based on everything that we are seeing.\nI\u2019m very happy with the progress or the results that we are able to show on expense control. Our expenses were up 7.9% against the 20% sales growth. And if you take out the labor, we did a great job and pretty much every area of expense control. And the reason I see take out the labor is the two components of labor are base salary or standard pay was in great shape, but our commissions and bonuses were way up. And that\u2019s a great problem.\nIt\u2019s great for our employees to come back and make good bonuses and good connections. And that\u2019s a problem that we would take every day. So overall expense is up less than 8%. I think everybody in the field, everybody on the Fastenal team has done a really nice job of hold the line when things are picking up. And it\u2019s not easy at this time because we\u2019ve been really tight for about 18 months, but it seems like everyone is rallying to make that happen.\nAt the beginning of the year, we talked \u2013 Dan and I and all the regional and senior people talked to people all year long and we said we really have \u2013 if things go well, our expenses are going to go up for one of two reasons; either we get a little bit loose and just spend the money on miscellaneous things or we stay real tight when we spend the money on bonuses. And I\u2019m happy to report to you and to the Fastenal employees that we are able to spend it on bonuses, not the other things, so that people get their jobs.\nHeadcount standpoint, our headcount was up a little bit. I actually had hoped that our store headcount would have grown a little more. We will see headcount growth throughout the year, not much in support. We are going to hold very tight in support and distribution. We may see a little bit in the distribution as volume picks up. But through the rest of the year, I can see between 300 and 500 FTE at the store site spread throughout the year. And that\u2019s really just to deal with the volume and make sure that we continue on the (inaudible) calling on customers.\nMost of that at the store would be part-time employees and a handful of full-time sales people. Another group of sales specialists are people that we are going to be adding, and these people will come out of our stores and be replaced by newer employees, as we are adding between 80 and 95 sales specialists. And some of those came into the second quarter and the rest would be added mainly in the third and the fourth quarter.\nThese people will be sales specialists in various areas, from government sales, vending sales, manufacturing sales, product specialists, that would be out working with our customers, driving business through our stores to help drive up the average store size. We have had some very good results with people we\u2019ve put in earlier in the year, and so we are going to continue to add that again to drive people \u2013 drive revenue through our existing store sites.\nAnother area that I\u2019m very happy with our progress is our pathway to profit or our pretax profit goal. If you look on page six of our earnings release, we have the chart that shows the profitability per store or per store size. And the one area that is probably the best progress that we\u2019ve made is in the small stores.\nAnd we have talked about that in both the first and the second quarter conference calls that we have been working very hard and that in probably the calls last year, working very hard in those small stores to reduce the expenses and get them to grow faster. So we have really made progress in two areas. One is we have greatly reduced the number of stores in that category and the other half is we have cut the losses by half in that group of stores. But in every category, our profitability has moved up nicely.\nThe 30 to 60, 60 to 100, 100, as you go down that list, every one is up I think a minimum of 2 percentage points over the previous year. And that\u2019s due to hard work, good expense control, improvement in margin, and everybody that\u2019s focusing on their business and taking it \u2013 looking at one store at a time to improve the profitability. So I\u2019m not ready to say that we are right back on track to pathway profit, but we are getting really close, and I think we are going to start marching forward assuming that the economy holds out for us. And so far, so good in that regard.\nThe last thing I want to touch on is store openings. We were very cautious in the second quarter, opening stores. And in June, we thought we would open a few more stores. One thing that\u2019s happening there is we have to break the district managers lose a little bit. We have been really tight on it with adding people and controlling their expenses.\nAnd so when things started to pick up, they were holding on to the rope pretty tight, didn\u2019t want to let go. And so we have to nudge them to open the stores. We are doing that. We believe that we will open between 80 and 95 stores in the back half of the year, and we would really be right back on track with our pathway to profit. That would give us 6% to 7% store openings on a second half of the year basis. And we are comfortable that we can get that done.\nWith that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Dan. Dan is going to give you a lot more color on the financials and then when he is done, we will open it up for questions. Again, thank you very much for your support.\nDan Florness\nThank you, Will, and good morning, everybody. I will touch on some of the things that Will touched on. I\u2019ll try to give a little more color without doing too much, but just some highlights. As Will mentioned and I refer everybody to that table we have on the bottom of page three, and again we started talking about this back in January.\nWe looked at a period in history, a period we chose as \u201998 to 2003. We felt the characteristics of that timeframe have many similarities with this timeframe. We had a prolonged period of industrial slowdown that started with the Asian flu in \u201998, really continued until the 2003 timeframe when it started ticking up. We pulled back our store openings in that timeframe, so a lot of similar dynamics in play.\nAnd as you can see on the pattern, five out of six months were at or above it. February was below because of weather impacts. May jumped out a little bit. Again, that was just a blockbuster month. And so, very pleased with the progress we have seen. And based on what we have seen thus far in July, we anticipate that trend line to continue. And let\u2019s see how that plays out.\nFrom a gross margin standpoint, and this is a sequential comparison, we\u2019ve picked up 100 basis points of additional margin \u2013 gross margin. And if I split that apart, about half of that improvement came at what I\u2019d consider \u2013 excuse me, 30% of that improvement came at the transactional level. And that was our day-to-day activity at our stores, people pricing product, challenging themselves to raise our margin. About 20% of it came at the organizational level, what we\u2019ve called the profit of our buying programs. About half of the improvement those two pieces combined.\nWe talked earlier in the year rebates continuing in our vendor programs, which are really volume-centric programs, which were mauled pretty severely. And as we went through 2009, we made nice progress there. From Q4 to Q1, we continued to make progress there from Q1 to Q2 that came up about 25 basis points of our improvement. So that\u2019s 75% of the improvement. The last 25 is all the other stuff.\nWe continue to make great progress in this timeframe with what we are doing with our freight programs. We continue to make \u2013 eek out 5 basis points, 8 basis points there in additional improvements. If you lump them all together, it adds up to about 25 basis points. So there is our 100 basis points of improvement.\nAs I look at that going forward, I think we have nice momentum on the transactional side and the organizational side. The rebate piece, we still have some incremental means, but they are becoming more marginal because we have really recouped back to historical patterns. As Will mentioned in the end market arena, our manufacturing business, when I compare Q1 to Q2 on a year-over-year basis, our improvement almost doubled.\nOn the non-residential piece, beginning in May, that looked positive. It\u2019s not helping our growth, but it\u2019s not going backwards. And we don\u2019t see anything in the near term that would cause that to change. But again when I get back to that trend pattern, we talked about the sequential patterns, that\u2019s really inherent in what we are looking at is continued weakness in the construction.\nI won\u2019t touch on any more other than, as Will mentioned, our store statistics, meaningful improvement in all categories. Particularly proud of that first group because that\u2019s not a case of business coming back, manufacturing business picking up that we saw the improvement. When you look at those stores doing less than 30,000 and the fact that our losses in that group dropped in half from a year-ago\u2019s percentage of sales, that\u2019s just hard work by our district managers and focused effort to say I\u2019m going to break these stores, I want to break them even faster. And they are making really nice progress in that area.\nThe pathway of profit information, one item I\u2019ll give a little color to, FTE headcount. If we look at since we began the pathway to profit and break out that information in the middle of the page, our store FTE is up about 11.5%. So during that timeframe, we\u2019ve continued to invest heavily in store personnel as we moved on the pathway of profit. Obviously, took a bit of a step-back in the last 12 months because of the economy, but continued to invest in our selling capabilities at the store. The remaining headcount is about 4.8% down.\nIf you look at the last two groups combined from where it was in Q1 2007 and that really plays into the fact that a lot of our support headcount are predicated on store locations, not sales, and getting very nice leverage there. One item I\u2019d point out, if you look at the distribution and manufacturing numbers on a year-over-year basis, you would see they are up. That up has caused that increase has caused entirely from the Holo-Krome acquisition. If you strip that out, that headcount would be down normally from last year as well.\nAs Will mentioned, operating and administrative expenses saw really nice leverage. And I\u2019ll share a few pieces of information. As everybody knows, our earnings are up roughly 60% on a year-over-year basis. If we look at all the incentive compensation we pay out, store commissions, profitability bonus, project area bonuses et cetera and lump all those together, our incentive comp was up almost 80% on a year-over-year basis.\nAnd our profit was up 60, which is nice \u2013 when I think about our support areas, when I think about our store personnel, in 2009, a lot of conversations, talking folks through about what was going to happen as that year played out and a lot of that was believed in where we can go as an organization and where to get through 2009 together.\nAnd I think second quarter of 2010 is a nice exclamation point to being through with 2009 and that we were able to reward our personnel for a job well done as we went through the year and I believe lot of legs to that. Also I\u2019m happy to say our profit-sharing bonus, which disappeared in 2009, was up nicely when I look at 2010 year-to-date and the second quarter.\nOne other item I\u2019d touch on, in the non-payroll operating expenses, our occupancy improved sequentially, as we would expect with we are out of the heating season. We still have a lot of opportunity there and a lot of work to do, and we would expect to see continued improvements in our occupancy expense.\nInterest statistic as looking at our fuel consumption over the weekend, and since 2008, our fuel expense \u2013 and a piece of it is in operating expenses, a piece of it is in margin because the diesel fuel in our semi fleet in margin, that is down 38.3% from the second quarter of 2003. If I average out the drop in fuel prices, both diesel and gasoline combined, they are down about 26%. So we did a nice job of picking up a whole bunch of efficiencies in that two-year period above and beyond just the unit cost expenses.\nWorking capital, accounts receivable were up 23% on a June-to-June basis, essentially in line with the sales growth. We were at about 21.1 the last two months, so a little bit added. A lot of that was driven by the fact that our industrial business is growing faster, our large account business is growing faster, as well as some of our international business growing faster. And some of those customer bases have terms that goes slightly longer and then pulls up our days, a fraction of a day, but very nice job on accounts receivable side. And our bad debt expense essentially dropped in half from where it was running in the timeframe of last year.\nInventory, that\u2019s one item on the quarter I\u2019m frankly disappointed in. If I look at our store inventory, the store component, year-to-date that\u2019s down about $2 million. That should be down around 10. And so when I look at what we\u2019ve done year-to-date overall with our inventory being up about $14 million, I\u2019m disappointed that it\u2019s at high. We still have very nice momentum. The $2 million that we have taken out occurred in the last several months. And so we have nice momentum, but we need to push hard in Q3 and Q4 to continue to manage that inventory number as we move forward.\nCash flow standpoint, a nice job year-to-date, 96% of our earnings have \u2013 is our operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings. And free cash flow is just north of 70%. And if you recall from previous calls, our target number is 80% to 90% for operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings and free cash flow of 50% to 60% and for well above those numbers six months into the year.\nWith that, I will turn it over to the Q&A.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Tom Hayes from Piper Jaffray.\nTom Hayes \u2013 Piper Jaffray\nGreat. Good morning, gentlemen.\nWill Oberton\nGood morning, Tom.\nTom Hayes \u2013 Piper Jaffray\nJust wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on your expectation on the \u2013 you mentioned some great performance on the profit by store size. Just your thoughts on timing on those smaller stores and your expectations on timing to get those stores to more breakeven.\nWill Oberton\nThat size of zero to 30 will probably never be at a breakeven. What they do is they migrate out and then we open new stores. So that pool is somewhat consistent, if that makes sense. But based on where they are, we think that the operating losses should be anywhere from 8% to 12%, not 24%. We were \u2013 we are putting additional expense and are trying to drive growth and we weren\u2019t getting much \u2013 seeing much improvement in the growth. So we backed up the expenses. They are still growing at the same rate. They are spending less money to get there. But they never \u2013 we never foreseen going to profitability.\nDan Florness\nIf you think about that group, the average store in there probably does around 20,000 a month. So there is about $10,000 in gross profit dollars and there is \u2013 right now, there is $12,000 of operating expenses. That math doesn\u2019t really change. The fact that we took that 12 down from 14 a year ago was quite an accomplishment.\nTom Hayes \u2013 Piper Jaffray\nNo, it is. You\u2019ve done a great job across the whole spectrum of store sizes. As a quick follow-up, we haven\u2019t talked much lately about the private label progress as far as your growth in that area. Just wondering if you could provide any update as far as new lines, are there growth rates in the private label versus kind of the broader spectrum of products.\nWill Oberton\nI actually don\u2019t have the growth rate on it, but we continue to work hard developing our private label brands and continue to find success and higher margin. But the actual numbers, I don\u2019t have with me.\nTom Hayes \u2013 Piper Jaffray\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from David Manthey from Robert W. Baird.\nLuke Junk \u2013 Robert W. Baird\nGood morning. This is actually Luke Junk for Dave this morning. My first question is, as we are getting back on track with pathway to profit here, could you maybe talk a little bit about maybe thinking about contribution margins going forward on whether the very strong 44% year-over-year that we saw this quarter?\nDan Florness\nGood morning, Luke. When I look out at Q3 and Q4 as an example and I look at year-over-year basis and look at sales growth, as you see in that table on the bottom of page two and you look at those patterns, what we are getting to the point where we get midway through the third quarter, we started to anniversary the comparisons and then our real operating leverage is getting back to two things. Pathway to profit, because our growth now is on a constant year-over-year basis; and the second piece is our ability to enhance our gross margins. We were very pleased with the 44%. We are hopeful that we\u2019re going to move out the balance of the year in Q3 and dropping off a little bit in Q4 that we are able to maintain upper 30s type of incremental margin.\nLuke Junk \u2013 Robert W. Baird\nThat\u2019s helpful. And then if we turn to pricing, I know you mentioned in the release some \u2013 the bias would be positive this year and we\u2019ve been hearing from some of our contacts (inaudible) some higher Fastenal prices coming over from Asia in the second half. How do you see that hitting the market if you move forward?\nWill Oberton\nThere are some \u2013 there are higher Fastenal prices that have kind of backed off a little bit recently over the last month or so. It\u2019s backed up a little bit. We see pricing going up, but it\u2019s going to be in the low-single digits. The Fastenal product line has a long tail because people have a lot of inventory. If we see any benefit, it will be in the latter half of the third quarter going into the fourth quarter as we see a little bit of benefit. But right now it\u2019s a little bit murky because of the uncertainty in the overall economy. It\u2019s not like it was back in late 2007 or the angles are going up at this acute angle. Slight increases here and there.\nLuke Junk \u2013 Robert W. Baird\nOkay. Thanks guys.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.\nWill Oberton\nGood morning.\nAdam Uhlman \u2013 Cleveland Research\nHi guys, good morning. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color about the sales trend that you have been seeing, if you could talk about sales by geography across the US. What did you see in Canada? And I guess Mexico is still kind of small for you, but \u2013 and then also if you could just talk a little bit more about how you guys are growing your non-residential construction sales right now, if you have done any work and how much of that is new account growth versus better oil and gas and mechanical customers, as you mentioned earlier?\nWill Oberton\nI can touch on the geographical. As far as the construction, we don\u2019t have all the fine detail on that, but geographically we\u2019ve actually seen a nice pickup across the country. There is no area that\u2019s weak. We are particularly strong in Eastern Canada. Western Canada is doing about at the same level as the other part of the business. The one area \u2013 I guess that there was one area that we are seeing a little bit of weakness is basically the Rocky Mountains, basically from Montana to New Mexico. That strip is a little bit soft for us. But some of that is that we get real \u2013 we were doing better last year. It didn\u2019t taper off as fast and so it\u2019s not coming back as fast. The brighter spot that we have is our international business. Asia is doing very well for us. Singapore, Malaysia, China are growing well above 50%. And we are seeing there is a lot of good things going on there. In the US, it\u2019s really pretty even coming back other than that Rocky Mountain area.\nAnd then as far as the construction, most of the large jobs that we are seeing are energy related, either coal-fired power plants that are going on. There is a lot of oil and gas in North Dakota, some construction up there putting in wells and infrastructure. We are hearing a lot of business with that. We\u2019re seeing rebuilding down in the Houston area with a lot of the refineries. We are doing some really nice business there. Most of the business that we are seeing was coming from existing mechanical contractors that are doing well. The part of commercial construction that\u2019s missing is you just don\u2019t see a crane up and down in the cities.\nAnother area that we\u2019ve really seen it basically completely gone is where they have put big boxes throughout the first half of 2000 to 2006. There was a Target, a Wal-Mart, a Home Depot going up in about 100 or 200 of our cities at any given time. And that is really nice business for us that\u2019s usually local regional contractors and they are locking in the store. If there is a Home Depot going up to pick up $3,000 to $5,000 a month in miscellaneous business until the project is done. That business is just non-existent today.\nAdam Uhlman \u2013 Cleveland Research\nOkay, great. Thanks for the color. And then just a follow-up on the international business. Some time ago you had some aspirations of opening up quite a few of international stores. Can you just update us on your thoughts there?\nWill Oberton\nDan is going to show \u2013 he is pointing out the number, but I can\u2019t read it.\nDan Florness\nYes. International locations, when I look at this year, close \u2013 almost 10% of our openings are international. And if we look at that from a percentage standpoint, that\u2019s meaningfully above where they are as a percentage of our business. And that trend is going to continue to broaden. The limiting factor always on locations, the section that we have international business is two things. One, when I think of our \u2013 I'm going to exclude Canada when I say this because Canada is far enough along developed that these two pieces don\u2019t really come into play. It operates very much like our US-centric store-based business.\nBut when I think of international, I would think of the two limiting factors. One is always the development of people and the ability to open stores. And that\u2019s a limitation that we\u2019ve always had in our organization. The second one is, when you look at particularly our Asian business, our model there is a little bit different. It\u2019s more of an OEM-centric faster model where we have fewer locations with larger business per location. So the dynamics of peer store openings are a little bit different, but we will continue to invest heavily in people into those international locations.\nAdam Uhlman \u2013 Cleveland Research\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\nWill Oberton\nOn a positive note, the international business is trending \u2013 from a profit standpoint, is trending at or above the company numbers. So that\u2019s not a concern.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Brent Rakers from Morgan Keegan.\nBrent Rakers \u2013 Morgan Keegan\nGood morning. First, just there is a comment in the release that reads, payroll was tracking in the 60% to 65% of SG&A range through the first quarter, and now it has moved back to the 65% to 70% historic range. I was hoping you can maybe give me a little color, because obviously there is not that kind of sequential jump Q1 to Q2, but I was hoping you could just talk through that in a little bit more detail.\nDan Florness\nWell, I mean, if you look at it historically, when you look at all the components of payroll, base pay, bonus pay, profit sharing, our school of business dollars, our healthcare dollars, historically we were in that upper range. Last year, unfortunately, because if you think about the business model, when you think about the components of operating expense, that is the most variable expense we have. Occupancy in the short-term much less variable because you have your locations and your expense is your expense. You can change the thermostat. You could renegotiate leases. But those are \u2013 that's about it. You still have a base of locations.\nAnd so that dropped last year because that variable expense dropped dramatically. When you look at on a year-over-year basis, that is sequential basis for that matter. Earlier I mentioned that our profitability, our commissions and profit bonuses combined were up almost 80% on a year-over-year basis. That combined with our FTE stabilizing and growing on a sequential basis is causing that expense as a percentage to grow faster than everything else until it\u2019s getting \u2013 it's moved back to where its norm is. Last year wasn\u2019t the norm.\nBrent Rakers \u2013 Morgan Keegan\nOkay. Great, that's helpful. And then, Will, just maybe \u2013 just to make sure \u2013 I want to clarify this. The target for the second half of the year in terms of FTE additions, 300 to 500, plus you also referenced another 80, so that means maybe approximately 400 to 600 sales force oriented additions on an FTE basis second half. Did I hear that correct?\nWill Oberton\nWell, about half of the 80 have been put in place. So it\u2019s correct if you just took it down by \u2013 you take it down by 40 to 50 and you\u2019re right.\nBrent Rakers \u2013 Morgan Keegan\nOkay, great. And then just one \u2013\nWill Oberton\nAnd also understand that most of that at the store level will be part time. So as a percentage of labor, it\u2019s not nearly as high as it sounds because it\u2019s a lower cost level, a lower rate.\nBrent Rakers \u2013 Morgan Keegan\nOkay. And then maybe just a follow-up, just to kind of tie what Dan said earlier. There is also talk about keeping the non-store based headcount relatively constant with where it is now. Is that as a percentage of total numbers or just constant with current levels, because as you add more stores, would that provide the need for more additions there?\nWill Oberton\nWe believe we can hold our support labor out. There will be some additions in distribution, but they will not be nearly as high as our sales growth should be. We are going to work very hard to hold the support pretty much flat. And whatever dollars we have, we want to put them into sales positions, growth drivers. We really believe if you can only invest in certain parts of the business closer to the customer will give us a greater return. And we found through the slowdown of 2009 that, you know, do we compromise a few things when we have fewer support people? Absolute, we always do. But our people have got better prioritizing and really getting the things that are necessary, that are most important. So hold support very tight, invest in sales, and see how it plays out and grow our business.\nBrent Rakers \u2013 Morgan Keegan\nGreat, thank you.\nOperator\n(Operator instructions) Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.\nSam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James\nGood morning, Will. Good morning, Dan. How are you?\nWill Oberton\nGood.\nSam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James\nSimple quickie there. First off, with respect to the rebates, Dan, I thought I recalled last quarter you mentioned that you expected the rebates to continue to improve in terms of having a positive contribution as the year progressed. Now it looks like \u2013 was there a pull-forward or an acceleration of that timeframe into Q2? I'm just trying to get a sense of juxtaposing what you said last quarter with what you are looking at now.\nDan Florness\nHistorically, that component of our margin is worth about 100 basis points. And last year what happened as we went through the year, that 100 dropped down to \u2013 in the fourth quarter, it was at about 30 basis points. We lost about \u2013 sequentially through the year, we lost about 70 basis points. We gained about half of that back in the first quarter. First quarter we had about 65 basis points. That number, if you look at what we earned in the second quarter, we are at about 97 basis points \u2013 we are basically back to 100 basis points. A little piece of that fits an ending inventory because of the way turns work, and so in our P&L, we picked up 25 basis points and we are running right now at 90. I see no reason why we won\u2019t get back to 100. When I talk about the contribution going forward, I see that being at 100 basis points. I didn\u2019t think 10 basis point sequential improvement was enough to talk about.\nSam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James\nGot you. Very helpful. Thank you. And then with respect to the new store productivity, very impressive getting the younger stores \u2013 less of a lost leadership standpoint. Talk about the new store productivity from a sales basis, where you're looking at from stores maybe a year old, what the average sales rate is for those stores versus perhaps a year or two ago. Is it a combination of additional leverage or is it more heavy lifting at the store level irrespective of sales trends?\nDan Florness\nYou know, I don\u2019t have those facts in front of me. So I\u2019m going to talk a bit from the hip [ph]. As Will mentioned earlier, when we have improving trends in sales growth, what happens is stores graduate out of that group and they move to the group and then to the third group to fourth to fifth et cetera. So when I look at that group, could the average store in there be 5% or 10% higher than it would have been a year ago? Maybe. But that won\u2019t really change that number because the piece that would be getting paid out and then added commissions and maybe adding people because that store is growing, or adding hours to the part-timer.\nIt really changed because we lowered \u2013 essentially we took couple of grand worth of monthly expenses out of those stores because the district manager decided it wasn\u2019t bringing value to my question and I\u2019m going to do without it. Now the fact that we might have given the DM a nudge to do that, that\u2019s irrelevant. The DM took dollars out of that store, because if the store is growing faster and it\u2019s getting to higher level, that\u2019s what drives us to graduate from that group.\nSam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James\nGot you. Last question, if I might. Will, you mentioned last quarter that your econometric model was suggesting that organic growth rates would perhaps peak at around September or October. Anything you are seeing now that would perhaps push that a little bit or bring it forward, or is that still the time frame you are looking at?\nWill Oberton\nYou mean year-over-year sales growth numbers?\nSam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James\nYes, sir.\nWill Oberton\nThat actually \u2013 I'll let Dan \u2013 Dan is jumping on me here.\nDan Florness\nActually, if you look at that trend pattern, once we get past July and then to August, you really see a pattern that starts to mirror that historical pattern.\nWill Oberton\nThat\u2019s actually above the historical pattern.\nDan Florness\nYes. But then so the growth then is on more of a steady-state business. That\u2019s what I was alluding to earlier when I was talking about the pathway to profit and what\u2019s going to drive our profitability improvements in the future. When we talk about September and October, that\u2019s really a comment not unique to 2010. That\u2019s every year in our business. Those are our peak sales months on an absolute dollar basis for the year because our business \u2013 our business is always running forward and growing.\nWhat happens in November and December is there just aren\u2019t enough business days and you have so many holiday impacts with businesses that are shut down for part of the Thanksgiving week, that are shut down for the Christmas-New Year timeframe. So the quality of the business days in November and December plus construction business slowing because the seasonality fall off. And historically, we look at our business and once we get through October, we now are developing our plan for the next year on our sales trends because January and October \u2013 really September-October, the daily average in that timeframe tends to mirror over historically what we\u2019re going to see the following January. So it was an absolute dollar peak, not a sales growth peak.\nSam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James\nI understand completely. Thank you much.\nDan Florness\nYes.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.\nHamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse\nThank you. Just wondering if you could comment about sales trends between your larger accounts versus your smaller customers? As well as, is it fair to say that everything you're seeing in the market right now is just a straight sell-through? Your customers are still pretty cautious regarding restocking. Any color you can give there would be appreciated. Thank you.\nWill Oberton\nAs far as the large accounts versus the small accounts, we are seeing better growth numbers out of the large accounts. But it\u2019s probably more about what type of account typically our manufacturing customers or our largest customers are growing nicely. And many of the small towns, as I said earlier, are the residential and non-residential contractors who are not doing very well at all. So I think it\u2019s more about the type of company than what the businesses we are in versus the size that they are. Even our small manufacturing customers are growing nicely. And what was the second half of your question?\nDan Florness\nI\u2019ll answer that. The second half was about sell-through versus inventory. This is a belief. I don\u2019t know this to be a fact. But I know \u2013 businesses that I talk to, people that I talk to, nobody is too excited about putting their neck out too far right now on two fronts. I don\u2019t think people are adding \u2013 are willing to put their neck out adding people too fast right now because there are not \u2013 there is enough uncertainty still about the future. And so you are not seeing a lot of headcount added by any company.\nThe second one is inventory. I think a lot of people have a very good memory of 2009. A lot of business that squeezed really hard where they have a certain inventory level to support their business, the business fell through the floor and all of a sudden, the stuff coming in the one door is greater than the stuff that\u2019s going out the other door. And a lot of companies built up inventory. And that\u2019s what amplified what happened in 2009. And we were no different.\nLate in \u201908, our inventory grew dramatically. And the inventory we dropped in the first half of \u201909 was really working off the bubble that built in the last three months of \u201908. And so I don\u2019t believe people are adding to their inventory other than to meet their shipping needs of the next few weeks or the next month depending on their business cycle and their supply chain. And so I believe the business we are seeing is real and it\u2019s not being lifted by inventory build.\nWill Oberton\nIf you think of the historical pattern, what Dan is talking about, what customers talking, less inventory, goes all the way back to the early \u201890s, the early recession \u2013 recession in the early \u201890s. Coming out of that companies started just in time inventory and a whole bunch of trends throughout our industry to lower what they had. Then in the early 2000 slowdown, it became much greater. CFOs were getting involved in their businesses. Call it Class-C items. We don\u2019t need that tool crib worth $600, $800 and millions of dollars. Let\u2019s get rid of that and let the distributors do it for us. That has been good for our business for 20 years.\nWe believe this trend is even stronger because the hit was even worse with the economy. And what I\u2019m hearing and I\u2019ve been talking to lots of customers, what can you do to close down my tool crib and you guys just take care of it? That is a very positive trend for Fastenal because we have more inventory closer to more customers and almost \u2013 probably than anyone else there. So we are very optimistic that no one will ever rebuild their inventory and they will depend on Fastenal to be their supply store for their factory. So it\u2019s very positive.\nDan Florness\nWith that \u2013\nSam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James\nYou\u2019re welcome. Thank you.\nDan Florness\nWith that, I\u2019ll close out the call. We are at 9:44. Close out the call by again thank you to shareholders listening to this call for your support and belief in Fastenal over the last 18 months through some pretty trying times. Thank you to the employees that are listening to this call for weathering through 2009. It wasn\u2019t a lot of fun. And a last item I\u2019ll turn out there, and this is from \u2013 I've been traveling for the last couple months and I was with Ken Nance who heads up our business in \u2013 from basically Dallas and then into Southern California.\nAnd when I was out there visiting with the Southern California DMs back in May, very impressive group, and he said something and he repeated it yesterday in the Board meeting that I thought was interesting. And one thing he really preaches to his guys, I\u2019m not sure if he read it in a book or if he came up with it or if he heard it from somebody else, but he said, the first thing I always impress upon my folks, you have to believe that we can do something. Once you believe it, then it gets a lot easier. You plan, you execute, and you repeat. That\u2019s all we do every day. Will, anything you want to add?\nWill Oberton\nNo. Thank you very much.\nDan Florness\nThank you.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s program. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.\n\n",

It\u2019s great to see all of you here and also welcome to those joining us on the webcast today. So this is the first analyst meeting we have had in a couple of years. We made a decision at that time to talk more frequently to you at events like launch events, which we have done, and more recently at Build and at E3. But with everything going on in the company, we thought a focused event, focused and dedicated to the investment community was the right thing to do. And so I welcome you here. I also want to acknowledge that for many of you, especially coming from the East Coast, this is one of several consecutive weeks who are travelling out west and we do appreciate all the time that you are spending with us.\nSo before we get started, I do want to cover the forward-looking statement. So the presentations today contain forward-looking statements, which are any predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors in this presentation and in the Risk Factor sections of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.\nSo with that before we dive into the agenda for the day, and we have a really great one, I do want to cover a couple housekeeping items. First, we are streaming today\u2019s event live on the Microsoft Investor Relations website at www.microsoft.com/investor. The PowerPoint slides and transcripts from today\u2019s event will also be available on our website following each presentation. And secondly, most of you have already probably received an e-mail containing a link to a survey. The feedback we get from you about the event is really important. We would very much like to get your feedback. We also have a drawing. For those who complete and submit a survey we will have a drawing for actually one of our new Xbox One consoles at launch. And I know there is a bunch of gamers out here who are eager to get your hands on one. So please do submit the survey.\nSo with that, this is normally the time where I would cover the agenda, but as Amy and I were planning for the day, she really also wanted to come out and welcome you and share her thoughts for the day and set the context as we start the day. So with that, I want to introduce Amy Hood, our Chief Financial Officer. Great, thanks Amy.\nAmy Hood - Chief Financial Officer\nThank you. Welcome. I can honestly say it\u2019s a real pleasure to have you all come out, be able to meet and shake hopefully a lot of hands after. I got to say hello to a few of you before. It means a lot that you will come out and spend some time with us, and we look forward to being able to share with you the journey we are on as we transition this company. You will hear a lot about that today.\nBefore I do that, I want to welcome John Thompson, who is our lead Independent Director at the Microsoft board. John is the Head of the Special Committee that\u2019s directing the CEO succession and search plan. While I know you have lots of questions on that, I wanted to go ahead and let you know there will be no further update on that today. The board continues on the process that we laid out in late August. So while I appreciate the questions we are working the process that we laid out and we will update you when appropriate.\nWith that, I want to talk a little bit about what the agenda today was meant to do and want to do it in the context of the strategy that we laid out and Steve laid out in July. Our goal is to have Kevin start the day. Kevin is going to cover really how we are already executing today in the field on this transition, how we are already building momentum and we are already taking share with this plan. It\u2019s really a plan we have been executing in many ways for years and laid out in the first way when we put the word devices and services in our 10-K a year ago. And so I look forward to you guys hearing from the person closest to the action about what we are really seeing in the market today and where we are taking share.\nAfter that, we are going to have an engineering panel, which has our key engineering product leaders that will be hosted by Tami Reller. I appreciate that many of you submitted questions. I appreciate that you put forward the hard ones. And I look forward to having Tami ask our engineering leaders those questions on your behalf today. Then we will open it up if there is further questions you can just ask directly. I think that will give you each an opportunity to get a sense of how the devices and services and high-value scenarios are really how they are working everyday to build that vision for the future. And that\u2019s what I hope you will hear specifically in the engineering panel. I also think it\u2019s a good opportunity for you to see the new leaders in their new seats. Many of you have not had that opportunity. I can tell you I take great energy from working with them everyday, and I hope you will feel that same positive energy from them on the stage. We will take a quick break and hopefully we will be on time. That would be a feat but I am committed.\nThen me, Amy Hood, the Chief Financial Officer, I am very proud actually to be able to say that. And I will talk a bit about the business model transformation and the changes in our business model that devices and services with high-value activities means. We have already made big transitions, but I think we can do a far better job of explaining to you all what that looks like. And I heard that feedback in my past five months on the job and I look forward to giving the first steps in explaining that today. We will also talk about the impact that\u2019s going to have on our reporting statements as I talked about at the end of Q4. Then I will turn it over to Steve to talk really about how we are setting this company up to capture all the opportunity that we see. After that hopefully we will have a chance to talk one-on-one at the reception and look forward to many more conversations with all of you in the future and looking forward to showing you the progress and the acceleration that I think you will see from us.\nSo with that, let me introduce Kevin Turner, our Chief Operating Officer who I think is the best man for the job in terms of explaining what we are seeing and all the progress and success that we are having in the market. With that, let me turn it over to Kevin. Thanks Kevin. Good to see you.\nKevin Turner - Chief Operating Officer\nWell, good afternoon. It\u2019s great to be here and it\u2019s great to be able to share what we are doing in the company and the things that we have going on. We have a lot of change. Certainly, we are embracing, but I am really, really proud that you came out and that we get to spend this time together. So I look forward to the day and the discussion.\nYou know, my mission and purpose today is to really lay out for you where we have strength, where we have momentum, where we see growth opportunities and absolutely show you while this business faces some headwinds in our PC market, with the PC market growth and with the acceptance of Windows 8 in the marketplace, we have a full transition that\u2019s underway. In fact, we have an incredible transition that\u2019s underway. And we have got some incredible momentum and some incredible growth and we see some incredible opportunities that I will touch on today. So that\u2019s my purpose and mission for you today.\nNow, as we get into it, in an FY \u201813 sense, I thought I would also give you some more context around that momentum. There is a couple of things that you may or may not have pulled out or delineated in our numbers that I will share. In the enterprise side for last year, our enterprise agreement billings were up 13%. Our unearned revenue, in other words, the deals that we have signed, but we have not booked, are up 12%. That if you compare that to any significant technology company that has any profitability that was best of the best across the enterprise last year. Big time, big time growth, big time opportunity and I think we are just getting started.\nOffice 365 became the fastest growing product in the history of Microsoft last year, fastest to $1 billion. We did over $1.5 billion last year, and it continues to accelerate and grow. Bing advertising grew 32%. Qi Lu and his team did a fabulous job increasing our revenue per search. And we see great momentum there. Double-digit revenue growth across SQL Server, System Center, Exchange, CRM, Lync and SharePoint big drivers of the revenue growth and where we saw a lot of volume.\nStrong market share gains, ladies and gentlemen, across our enterprise cloud and I will share a little bit more context on that with you in a moment, SQL, Hyper-V, our virtualization product, Lync, and Xbox. Xbox became the worldwide console share leader last year and we are very proud of that performance as well. Additionally, we have a giant XP install base. But guess what? We have made so much progress on that XP install base. It\u2019s down to 21% worldwide. And we have plans to get that number to 13% by April when the end-of-life of XP happens. This has been a major and multiyear initiative for us and one that we have worked very hard on to make sure we can execute towards.\nMicrosoft China, Brazil and Russia all exceeded $1 billion in revenue for the very first time in the history of the company. And there is a lot of significance around that in the BRIC markets and we like the momentum and where we are going. China incidentally is the fastest growing market in the company today. And it\u2019s been a long, long time since that\u2019s been the case at Microsoft and that is the case today.\nCustomer satisfaction, ladies and gentlemen, in our enterprise accounts is at an all-time high. And I am very, very proud of that. Our folks in the field in the frontlines have really done a spectacular job working with our customers, building their trust, developing and implementing the solutions at a faster rate than ever, and it\u2019s showing up in all of the surveys, both internally and externally. And one of the things that you may or may not know about our business and this transition that we are in is we have made a very graceful transition from our traditional enterprise agreements and the licensing agreements that made Microsoft so profitable for so long as we transition those agreements and those customers into the cloud. We have done a phenomenal job landing them gracefully from a transition perspective and I feel very good about that. So those are some under-the-cover highlights that I wanted to share with you about our business.\nNow, I also have a chart here that we don\u2019t show much externally. So today, it\u2019s been updated for you to be able to see and get the flavor. We don\u2019t break our business down too often for you by customer segment. But if you look at our business and the makeup of the company today, well over 55% of the business is enterprise and additionally, there is some OEM business there that belongs in enterprise, but that\u2019s how we count it and market. 19% is OEM, 20% is consumer and online and a fair piece of the OEM is also consumer and online. And 6% is our small and midsize business. And then when you look at that full picture as a segment, it\u2019s really telling of where we got a lot of strength and it\u2019s complemented with our consumer presence. And I will talk more about that in a moment.\nOn the product side again, the Office Division is the biggest division in the company at 35% of our overall total; Server and Tools is second at 26%; Windows is third now at 25%; Entertainment and Devices at 13%; Bing and Online at 4%. So you can see the shape and transition of our business on this particular chart that Windows is now the third largest business in the company.\nWhen you also look geographically, 44% of our revenue, ladies and gentlemen, comes from the U.S. and Canada and 56% comes from the rest of the world. I show you and illustrate these pie charts so that you can see we have a very balanced and diverse business, not only from a customer segment standpoint, but from a geographic and the theaters of operations where we operate and also our products and services.\nNow, another chart that we don\u2019t show that often is the productivity and efficiency. In the field, in our field sales and marketing group, we have around close to half the company sits in this particular organization that I get the chance to work with. And over the last several years, we have done some incredible things from an efficiency and effectiveness standpoint to continue to drive the productivity up in the field in a big way. And when you look at it, you think about that efficiency and effectiveness. That includes the headwinds that we have got with our OEM partners with the PC market. We are still driving productivity increases in the field. And a big, big credit goes to the productivity as well as the solutions that our engineering groups are bringing to the marketplace. So efficiency and effectiveness has been alive and well here at Microsoft and continues to be something that we are going to continue to drive going forward.\nNow, let me touch on devices and services. You are going to hear a lot about that throughout the day. And let me tell you from my vantage point, a few things about it. Devices and services, to me it doesn\u2019t mean that we are going to make all the devices. We want a healthy ecosystem. We absolutely love partners and we want that open ecosystem, but it does mean we are going to make some of the devices and some of the hardware. And so you are seeing us get into some of that first-party hardware. And it also means that on the services side, that really the scale services that we have in the company are really in the consumer space. And as a result of having those consumer services, we are able to deliver world-class business services at scale, which we couldn\u2019t do otherwise, which makes us a very, very fundamental competitor.\nAnd so when you think about the opportunity of these two worlds, I want you to understand that we see and know about the seams between hardware and software integration. We know that. That\u2019s been exploited against us in the past. But going forward, we have got a much different lens to be able to engage more deeply with our partners by having first-party products. And it is when we announced Surface a little more than a year ago, there was a lot of consternation, let\u2019s say, in the OEM channel. As a result of that consternation, today when you talk to the OEM channel in most instances, they would tell you that the progress we made in 8.1, because we have a first-party product at Microsoft, is far superior to anything we have ever delivered from hardware-software integration to our OEM partners going forward. And again, you are going to see that more and more of the seams within the technology and the hardware and the software are going to go away and dissipate as we get better and better and certainly continue to build our capability in this area.\nNow, there are four giant mega trends we see in the marketplace, where customers are spending money. They are cloud, social, mobility, and big data. We see these mega trends as excellent opportunities for us to be able to drive growth. But let me start with the cloud. Gartner says that the public cloud market by 2015 is a $180 billion opportunity. We agree with that. In fact, we may even say it\u2019s going to be bigger than that by 2015. If anything, we are bullish on how fast customers are moving to the cloud.\nOne of the areas that we made a lot of traction on this past year was the progress we made in our consumer cloud services. In the consumer cloud service space, we have a 13% growth in users year-on-year. We are averaging now 5.6 billion queries per month on our Bing product. Almost 27 points of the market share in the U.S. on this particular product. And we have an application out there called BingItOn.com. And for everybody that goes to that site that does side-by-side searches with the next-biggest competitor, we win two out of three times. And so we have got a lot of traction in this particular area and a lot of momentum that we are driving. Thanks to the hard work of the engineering group, 460 million users on MSN. Xbox LIVE is now one of the largest paid services in the world at 48 million Xbox LIVE members in 41 countries, and that business continues to explode. Skype now drives a third of all international phone traffic, and people spend over 2 billion minutes, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion minutes per day on Skype.\nOutlook.com, 400 million people use Outlook.com. This product is growing again; it\u2019s vibrant; we have re-launched it; we took Hotmail, made it contemporary and modern; and we are seeing a lot of traction and pickup on Outlook.com. And SkyDrive, one of the fastest adopted products in our history, now has 250 million people using SkyDrive, which is incredible. The thing I want people to understand about these consumer services is these are all multi-tenant, at-scale, gigantic services that allow us to do a very, very good job on the enterprise services. And we have learned a ton about how to do these services at scale, how to manage the bandwidth, how to make sure that we have the right cost-effective solution that we would have never been able to do had we only concentrated on enterprise services first. Now, the traction we\u2019ve had on enterprise services is phenomenal. Office 365, which I talked about, 1.5 billion from a run rate perspective, we should blow that away this next year, ladies and gentlemen, that is the fastest-growing product we\u2019ve ever had. And it continues to be very widely adopted, and I will talk more about that in a moment.\nWe\u2019re now really getting into public sector and government. In fact, we have got a million government employees in the U.S. moving to Office 365. And more importantly, we have had some significant wins in Canada, India, Australia, the UK, France, and Germany on our cloud as well. So the momentum in the public sector space for public cloud is incredible.\nAzure is growing at 200%. And more impressively, 50% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure. And so we have really come out of the gate. We came out of the gate with some advanced technology from our Server and Tools team as it relates to platform as a service. They have added the infrastructure as a service capability in the last year, and we really see the uptake happening in an accelerated way. And we have enterprise cloud services in China. And to the best of our knowledge, ladies and gentlemen, we are the only multi-national technology company in the world who offers public cloud services in China. And we have an incredible amount of pent-up demand. And that is a beautiful thing for Microsoft. Because as you know, we are IP-challenged in China, and now in the cloud services world, everybody that uses the service pays for the software and the service. And so that\u2019s we see that as a significant strategic enabler for us to continue to make a lot of progress on.\nOur CRM Online business is growing over 80%. And Kirill and the Dynamics team have done a phenomenal job on this particular product, and we are really seeing a lot of great uptick and traction. Now, I wanted to share with you some of the details. And I won\u2019t clear all of this slide, but I wanted to give you the context of this particular slide. This is a slide we use with customers. This is a slide we use to really go in and show the breadth and depth of the Microsoft enterprise cloud services that we offer today.\nLadies and gentlemen, we offer three distinct types of cloud: private, hybrid, and public across three distinct types of workloads and applications. And if you take infrastructure and platform with Azure and SQL Azure and Windows Azure, we also provide a service there with Intune where we remotely manage desktops. We have an incredible offering in that space. Now, on the business solutions side, Dynamics CRM, Dynamics ERP, which Kirill and his team are cloud-enabling and working hard on that, as well as our partners, is also a very, very accelerated growth business for us.\nAnd then the big space, which is productivity and collaboration, is something that, again, we are very, very strategically well-positioned. This is what we offer in market today. And if a customer has Active Directory and System Center completely deployed, we can take them to the cloud with ease. In that way, they have common identity, they can take advantage of the virtualization, common management, and the development environment is very unified so that the enterprise doesn\u2019t have to care whether it\u2019s on premises, hybrid, or in the public cloud. So we have got a leading and comprehensive enterprise cloud offering. And that\u2019s backed up with the significant momentum that we have.\nNow, let me give you a statistic. This past year, we grew Office 365, deployed seats, over 350%. 350% deployed users we added in FY \u201813 alone. And it\u2019s still accelerating. We are only at the tip of the iceberg of this particular opportunity. And I already touched on 200% growth in Azure and 80% growth in Dynamics CRM, CRM Online. So when you think about Dynamics and CRM, you think about Azure and you think about Office 365, we have significant momentum.\nSome of you ask from time to time, though, well what are you doing about Google in the enterprise? Well, right now, we are winning them back one account at a time, one hand-to-hand mission at a time. In fact, this past year, we had 440 customers won back in FY \u201913 alone. And that\u2019s an incredible compliment to the technology and all of the work that our Office 365 team did to enable that and it\u2019s a compliment to our people who have earned the trust of customers. Because it turns out that security, privacy, data protection, enterprise-grade cloud are very, very important to enterprise customers. And we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change; we only see that accelerating. And it helps that we don\u2019t read people\u2019s e-mails and snoop their WiFi and those type of things, because it gives them comfort to be able to invest in our solution. But that\u2019s something, again, from an enterprise perspective, is very, very important for us to continue to drive that.\nNow, here is a slide we\u2019ve never seen before because we get a lot of questions about this transition to the cloud, you know, really is it underway? Well, I took four actual accounts. You can see there a business technology consulting company, a car company, global electronics company, and an entertainment company. This was our Microsoft enterprise revenue before they went to our cloud. After our cloud deployment, this is our revenue opportunity. You see, Microsoft has never been considered a mission-critical IT provider, service provider in the enterprise. Today, we are. That\u2019s the new Microsoft. The new Microsoft says we are getting a much richer and deeper share of wallet, ladies and gentlemen, from those customers who go to the cloud with us. And we see this over and over again. So we have a great opportunity to be able to leverage that and continue to leverage that. And you have got both Office 365 and Azure accounts so that you can see the full assortment of our offering in the marketplace. We think this is a tremendous opportunity for growth and upside.\nI also get a lot of questions. Well, what are you doing about private cloud? How are you really competing against a really good competitor like VMware? Well, you know what, we started with zero share. I love this chart because in \u201808, we had nothing. We were absolutely at zero. If you look at what\u2019s happened, really in the last 7, 8 quarters, it\u2019s been an incredible shift of what\u2019s happened. VMware peaked its share at 54%, and they are down to 52.4%. All we have done during that timeframe is go from 22 points to 30 plus points. And we are just driving and winning share according to IDC, every single quarter. And we are just going to keep doing that. I mean, we are growing at almost three times their rate today for two reasons, ladies and gentlemen, we have better technology. When Windows Server 2012 came along and the new release of Hyper-V the product group gave us a better technology platform to be able to go in and win this business. And as a result of that great technology, we also have a better value proposition. We are about a third the price. And so when you think about better technology and a better value proposition, it really is a powerful formula to continue to accelerate the growth. And we are going to continue to drive that.\nNow, the second big mega trend I want to talk to you about is social. And specifically, I want to talk to you about enterprise social. If you take the market of just unified communications and you take CRM and put those two together, we see it as a $38 billion opportunity according to Gartner, and that\u2019s a huge, huge potential for us because we have a lot of assets lined up in this space. When you look at what we have got to leverage and lean on in the enterprise social space, two out of three information workers worldwide use SharePoint today. 85% of the Fortune 500 use Yammer. And the Yammer-paid network is a wonderful company that we acquired a while back, the paid users on the Yammer network last year grew 200%. 90 out of the Fortune 100 are using Lync and Skype is still growing like crazy 300 plus million Skype users and now that we have integrated Lync and Skype, and I will touch on that in a moment. It\u2019s an incredibly effective scenario that we have to be able to take the enterprise social to the next level.\nOne of our biggest assets certainly is Active Directory. And the ability to put Active Directory in the cloud gives us this incredible opportunity that we have on identity and management and single sign-on and all of the things for provisioning of the cloud and enabling of the social enterprise. Now, when you think about the unified communications space, what we are able to do with the Lync business and the Skype business, and Tony Bates formerly and his team have done an incredible job bringing these things together. Lync is a billion dollar product. Skype has 320 million users. And in addition to that, you might not know, Skype by itself grew connected users last year 30%. That\u2019s an incredible number. And it\u2019s only accelerated since they became a part of the Microsoft family.\nAnd the ability to take Lync and Skype, now Microsoft is shipping more enterprise voice lines on unified communications than any other technology company in the world. And we are just going to continue to drive and leverage that opportunity, because SharePoint as a product, ladies and gentlemen, was extremely powerful behind the firewall. It was formerly the fastest growing product in the history of Microsoft until Office 365 came along. With the new release of SharePoint, we not only do a great job behind the firewall, we also built hooks in the product that allow external data feeds from LinkedIn, Twitter, you know pick your favorite social mechanism, you now have the ability to get internal and external data feeds to be able to exploit the capability. And when you put it together with CRM, Lync and Skype, Yammer and the integration of the Yammer into SharePoint and Office 365, we have got an incredibly compelling story as it relates to social and the enterprise.\nAnd one piece of social that I had to touch on here because it\u2019s so impressive is in the Xbox LIVE space, 48 million users as I said in 41 countries. Couple of stats you may not know, 42% of the Xbox LIVE subscribers in the U.S. now watch 30 hours of digitally distributed TV and movies every month. And also we are proud to be able to report now nearly 40% of the Xbox LIVE audience in the United States is female. That\u2019s a giant change from when we launched our platform. And Xbox delivered over 18 billion hours of entertainment globally in 2012 alone.\nAnd we are excited about the upcoming Xbox One launch. We believe we have got an incredible offering with Xbox One as it relates to multiplayer experiences and services. It\u2019s going to give you, we have wrapped a lot of entertainment with the product as well and we believe we have got our strongest game line up, and the external pundits say it as well that we have ever had to be able to offer the company. So we are excited about the potential of what we can do with Xbox and Xbox LIVE from a social perspective.\nNow everyone knows mobility is on fire. Mobility has changed how and where people work and communicate today. It\u2019s a mobile applications and mobility-first market out there. It\u2019s the driving force behind the Internet of Things. And according to Gartner, it\u2019s $716 billion in devices that will be spent by 2017. The two key areas that we are going to focus on, on mobility first and foremost is around productivity. We are really driving for the best Office Mobile experience across all platforms. And we want to provide a great experience on both iOS and Android phones. And when you think about what we have done, we now have Office Mobile for iPhone in the Apple app store. It\u2019s free for those Office 365 subscribers. And it\u2019s available in 135 markets and 29 languages.\nOffice Mobile for the iPhone lets you view and edit across Word, PowerPoint, Excel and you get the similar experience to what you get on a Windows Phone. And we have Office Web Apps available for iOS, high-fidelity document viewing in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote on the iPhone and we have some viewing and some editing available on the iPad. And so we are continuing to work through how to bring and be the strongest productivity player across all platforms, including iOS and Android in the marketplace.\nThe second big area that we are focused on in mobility is we want to be the leader in mobile device management. And with the new release of System Center, we not only manage Windows devices, we also manage iOS and Android devices really well. And we wrapped with Intune, we have an incredible story to be able to bring mobile device management to a whole new level across all devices. So in the bring your own device world, we have a great solution with System Center to be able to help enterprises and businesses really and deeply manage all devices.\nYou know we have a great release with Windows 8.1 coming out. And I wanted to touch on that for just a moment. In 8.1, we have got some incredible enterprise features. We have got tremendous IT controls built into 8.1. We have got the ability to do remote data business removal. We have got open mobile device management available, so you no longer have to have a server at your enterprise to be able to manage the mobile devices. We have got direct access, which require no separate VPN to be able to get into the network. We have got something called Workplace Join, which is very exciting. The ability for someone to show up at work with their own but personal device for them to be able to use Workplace Join, for the enterprise to be able to control the business data on that personal device, and in the event that employee leaves the company, loses the device, the corporation, the enterprise, has the ability to remotely wipe and clean the business data only on that device without touching, harming, or impacting the personal data. This is powerful.\nIn fact, we had 117 of our largest CIO customers here this week at our Global CIO event. This was one of the most talked about features we had at the event, the ability to really control bring your own device and really have the high-powered security, management encryption technologies that we have come to invest in over the last probably 13, 14 years in this particular area. So I am very excited about our device management strategy.\nWe have also made some impressive progress as it relates to Windows Phone. The one thing we know about Windows Phone is when people use it, they really, really like it. In fact, we won a lot of surveys this past year on the quality of the experience. And yes, we are proud of the fact that we have now scratched and made progress to be the third largest selling smartphone OS in the world. Now, we are a distant third. So we have got a lot of work to do there, but we are making progress and continuing to innovate in a giant way.\nWhen you look at some of the progress we have made globally, Latin America up 900%, India 400%, China up 300%, Asia-Pacific up 300%, Middle East and Africa up 700%. Again, the momentum in the marketplace, particularly outside the U.S., is accelerating for us. And we are going to continue to double down and leverage that. And one of the things that we are very excited about is the capability that Nokia brings to the company. Not only do we have an impressive line-up of devices, the 1020 at the high end, which has a 41-megapixel camera. It\u2019s the best smartphone camera in the world, all the way down to the Nokia Lumia 521, that is really selling well from an opening price point perspective in emerging markets. This past week, we launched the Nokia 925, where we got into metals \u2013 Nokia got into metals and its available here at AT&T. It\u2019s our thinnest and lightest offering. It\u2019s a very, very impressive phone.\nAnd so the capabilities that Nokia brings with us on distribution, supply chain, the ability to continue to leverage the economies of scale that they bring, we are very excited pending regulatory approval of the potential and possibilities of this particular acquisition. But I also want to stress the fact that we remain very open with our phone system and we have phones available from HTC, Samsung, Huawei, TCL, Alcatel, we want to continue to have that opening existing. And we are going to continue to provide that because we believe that\u2019s an important part of our offering going forward.\nNow, for the holiday, a lot of questions have been raised around what about the tablets, what about the devices? This year we have got a very impressive holiday set of devices coming out from our OEMs. And I have got to tell you, I haven\u2019t been as excited as I am in a very long time around Haswell and the potential for Haswell devices and BEETLE devices and what they can do in the marketplace. Haswell from Intel gives us the capability to have a fan-less device on an X86 platform, which means thinner, lighter, better battery life. And so that is going to open up a whole plethora of new devices, new styles, new form factors in the marketplace. And again, we are very excited from tablets to two-in-ones to affordable touch notebooks to ultrabooks all the way through the big all-in-ones out there that you see. So we are working hard with our OEM partners across the board to bring the very best devices we can to the marketplace. But to do that, we have got to improve the retail buying experience. It hasn\u2019t been what any of us would have liked.\nAnd we have got a couple of rollouts going on right now in Best Buy and Dixons that I will give you a little color on. In the Best Buy stores, we have done 200 stores so far. And we are absolutely seeing an increase in the Windows device category after we reset the store with the Windows Store. And all of the learnings that we have gotten from our physical stores, we have cranked into how to do this extremely well within the Best Buy store. And the ability to get that synergy and make the Windows PC buying experience, the Windows tablet buying experience, the Windows Phone buying experience get that to a whole new level is what we are allowed to do with this new format. And I encourage you if you are in town the Best Buy here in Bellevue is reset. It\u2019s one of the 200. And you should check it out. We are also doing something very similar in Dixons and working our way through the key retailers around the world to really figure out how to improve this in-store experience and be able to become much richer and certainly much more impressive from a device buying experience standpoint.\nThe last mega trend I will touch on is Big Data. IDC claims this is a $24 billion opportunity by just 2015. We would agree with that. Our Big Data assets line up like this, SQL, certainly at the heart, double-digit (Technical Difficulty)\u2026\nChris Suh - General Manager, Investor Relations\nThanks for your patience. We had a power outage in the building. We are doing it as quick as I can \u2013 as quick as we can back there the teams are running, but I just did want to give you an update. Thanks for your patience. We will get going very shortly. And as soon as we are up and running with the webcast as well, because this event is webcast. We will come back out we will start the panel, but hang tight and thanks very much.\nWhen I talk to most of you, you tell me how interesting it is to cover Microsoft. I guess this just adds to the folklore. So we are back. We had a partial power outage. The teams have worked furiously and we are back online. So welcome back everyone. Welcome back to those on the web. We are going to go ahead and keep with the schedule. I do want to let you know also that Kevin\u2019s full presentation will be posted shortly to the Microsoft Investor Relations as you can access the entire presentation in its entirety. We did just take the break and so we are going to go ahead and move straight into the panel. And with that, I want to introduce Tami Reller, Executive Vice President, Marketing.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nThanks Chris.\nChris Suh - General Manager, Investor Relations\nThanks Tami.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nGreat. So it\u2019s a great pleasure to be here and we are back to business. I am very honored to be able to host this panel. I think this will be a very good way for you to get a chance to see our engineering leaders in action, hear from them, and get some perspectives on the opportunities ahead, the challenges ahead and some of the priorities that we have as a company. And so I\u2019ll bring them out shortly.\nI mean, on July 11, we announced a pretty significant reorganization to really drive the transformation of our company. And I can tell you that in the two months since that time, I certainly have seen the senior leadership team working more effectively together and that was the goal really to breakdown barriers and instead of working in any kid of silos to really work as a team. And so that\u2019s part of the objective that we have today too is to allow you to see that team in action. So we will spend the next 45 minutes both answering questions that you have already posed to us, and we will take those on. And then we will also open it up to your questions. So with that, let me ask the panelists to come on out and we will get started. So panel come on out. Thank you. Please welcome them.\nTerrific. So while they are getting settled, let me just do some introductions. I think you probably have a good sense of who these folks are. We have Julie Larson-Green, who leads our Devices and Studios Group. Welcome, Julie. We have Satya Nadella, who leads our Cloud and Enterprise Group. We have Terry Myerson in the middle, who leads our Operating Systems Group, and that\u2019s across PC, tablet, phone and Xbox on the Operating Systems side. We have Kirill Tatarinov, who leads Microsoft Dynamics and has for many years. And we have Qi Lu, who heads up our Applications and Services Group and that now includes Skype and Office. So I think we will touch on a number of those topics as we go through this.\nAlright. So I am going to dive us right into the questions that came from you all already. And I think some of these questions came from several of you, but let me kick it off. So the first question came in various forms. I am going to use a question from Kirk Materne of Evercore. And he asked the following, what is the general thought in terms of the availability of some of Microsoft\u2019s key productivity apps, he notes Office and Word specifically on iOS, specifically the iPad and Android devices? How do you decide strategically what to ship and on what operating system? So Qi, that is definitely for you.\nQi Lu - Head, Applications and Services Group\nThanks, Tami. Thanks for the questions. So strategically we use a combination of two factors to guide decision makings on what to ship on what devices and on what timetables. The first factor is customer interest and customer experience. It is quite important for us to ensure that there is genuine customer interest, customer needs, and at the same time we can also deliver a quality experience that serves our customer needs. The second factor is economics, and financially it has to make sense for Microsoft. So those are the two factors that guides our decision-making. So for example, we have developed versions that are touch first for tablets for some products in our Office suite, Lync and the OneNote. And we make those products available on non-Microsoft devices such as the iPad. Now all set the Office suite will also have Skype and the SkyDrive, and they are available on Android and iOS devices. But within the Office suite today we have versions of products that are designed for the desktop, for mouse and the keyboard. They are available on Windows and on Mac. And they are touch-enhanced for Windows, but they are not designed to be touch first. And then we have Web versions of those apps available across all the devices, and those apps are also available via Terminal Services.\nNow, we are working on touch-first versions for our core apps in the Office suite, Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and we will bring these apps to Windows devices, and also to other devices in ways that meets our customers\u2019 needs, and the customer value of those experiences, and in ways that economically make sense for Microsoft, and at a proper timetable. So, that\u2019s how we think about making these decisions as the question is being posed.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nThat\u2019s great. Thank you, Qi.\nSatya Nadella - Executive Vice President, Cloud and Enterprise Group\nAnd I will just add that on the enterprise infrastructure, we have been living with these principles for a long time. And if you look at where we are with the hypervisor, we support both Windows and Linux. When it comes to the System Center and the ability to manage a variety of virtualization infrastructure, there are many customers who today use System Center to manage even ESX from VMware. When it comes to device management, we in fact, have our mobile device management in System Center and Intune that manages Android, iOS, and Windows devices. And then on the development side, again, Linux is a runtime. We have Java support. So we have a pretty open way to go about both infrastructure products and developer products. And it really stems from the same principles that Qi talked about, and also the fact that enterprises are heterogeneous, and we recognized that and so that we are executing on that strategy.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nThat\u2019s terrific. Thanks Satya. Thanks Qi. I would also note that Kevin Turner had a slide in his deck that really highlighted our offerings today on that front, and so that\u2019s another good reference point for those interested there. So our next question we also get a lot. We got a lot in submissions for today as well. This one came from Hari at Neuberger and asked, how are you going to make progress toward a common development platform across multiple screens, specifically phone, TV, PC and tablet? So, Terry, that obviously is right at you, and I know this is near and dear to your heart.\nTerry Myerson - Executive Vice President, Operating Systems Group\nThanks. We have been together, brought all the OS groups together at the company for about two months now. And we really haven\u2019t been wasting any time in terms of organizing all of our efforts in the operating system area around three key beliefs.\nThe first of those is that we really should bring \u2013 we should have one silicon interface for all of our devices. We should have one set of developer APIs on all of our devices. And all of the apps we bring to end users should be available on all of our devices. The second belief was that all of our devices are becoming more cloud-powered. So whether we are branding them Windows or Xbox, we really need one core service which is enabling all of our devices. And the third belief was that each of our devices require a tailored experience to be really special for the customer. Whether that\u2019s a three-inch phone, or it\u2019s a 9-inch tablet, or a 14-inch clamshell, or a 60-inch television playing Xbox games, we want to facilitate the creation of a common, a familiar experience across all of those devices, but a fundamentally tailored and unique experience for each device.\nSo our team is now organized in this way. We had a core team that will bring those silicon interfaces together, bring those developer platforms together, approach delivery of apps to the customers in a common way. We have one team delivering the core services that will light up our devices. And then we have satellite teams each focused on each of the device categories, so each of them can be reflective of what the customer expects in that place. We got a very clear vision of what we want to get done, and we are moving very fast.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nGreat. Thanks Terry. And I am going to jump in with another quick follow-up directly to you, because I do know it\u2019s on the minds of the people in the room. And that is, can you talk a bit about the role that Windows RT plays going forward, how do you think about that as you just described the vision?\nTerry Myerson - Executive Vice President, Operating Systems Group\nSure. So we have two very important chipset families in everything we are doing in all of our devices and that\u2019s X86 and ARM. The ARM devices in particular in phones have incredible share due their battery life and the connectivity options available with the systems on the chips on the ARM ecosystem. Windows RT was our first ARM tablet. And as phones extend into tablets, I expect us to see many more ARM tablets, Windows ARM tablets in the future. With regard to Windows RT 8.1, which really is two significant new improvements this year. The first is that Windows RT 8.1 supports the next generation of ARM silicon. So it\u2019s really got great performance characteristics. And secondly, the full Outlook experience is now available on Windows RT. So with the full Office \u2013 the full Office suite is now available for the customer.\nJulie Larson-Green - Executive Vice President, Devices and Studios Group\nWhen we came up with Surface, the idea to do Surface, and that tablet it was really about bringing the best of a tablet and productivity all in one thing. And we still really believe in that vision and going forward. We have learned a lot, where 8.1 adds a lot of capabilities and gets us closer to that vision. It was a V.1 and that we are committed to going forward with that.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nThat\u2019s great. And, in fact, Julie I\u2019ll probably go to you next and ask you some Surface questions, which I know are in the room, as well. We have a Surface event next week, so obviously that will be a time for us to talk more about the future. But if we say what have we learned from what we have done so far, and how are we thinking about how that\u2019s informing how we are going forward?\nJulie Larson-Green - Executive Vice President, Devices and Studios Group\nSure. And we are very committed to creating great first party hardware and continuing what we started with Surface. I think what we learned a lot is that you need to have balance to be successful in the market. So you need to have the combination of great hardware, great software, apps and services in order to win. And we learned this with Xbox, when the first Xbox came out it was hardly any games, it took a while for us to get going with it. And we are very optimistic about what we are doing in terms of the changes that are being made in the software, the applications that are coming online, the services, and improving the hardware, both in terms of speed, performance, and the integration with the software. Now something mature like, say the PC market itself, Surface Pro we saw the uptick on that very quickly, because it was a mature market with a mature software, and with a mature set of services. So I think we are learning about the nascent part of trying to create this kind of Surface holistic device and we are going to continue forward. And we have a lot of things to announce on Monday that I am excited to talk about.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nThat\u2019s great. Thanks Julie. And then part of that balance is clearly our ability to execute in the market, and that\u2019s something where we continue to just tune and get better and learn and it is making a difference. And so in addition to all of the product work that we are doing, both on the hardware and the software, again we just continued to get better and better execution at retail and with our commercial customers in executing on Surface.\nJulie Larson-Green - Executive Vice President, Devices and Studios Group\nAnd in particular we are seeing a lot of uptick with students who want that user simplicity, the productivity of the tablet, but also the entertainment and communication that comes with that.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nYes, definitely one of the fastest growing segments there. So that\u2019s terrific. Alright, so Kevin did a terrific job talking about enterprise and our execution there, our opportunity across enterprise and so let\u2019s talk enterprise, panelists. So it seems like not that long ago that people would say that Microsoft was even credible in the enterprise. So clearly with all those statistics we saw from Kevin no one is saying that now. So we are going to start with you, Satya, and I think there\u2019s one part of our business in the enterprise that\u2019s definitely been on a roll, and that\u2019s our SQL business, which I know you love talking about. So we have got several questions around this, but let me phrase it this way. Can you continue to outpace Oracle, and how will the big data trend really impact Microsoft going forward?\nSatya Nadella - Executive Vice President, Cloud and Enterprise Group\nYes, I mean the SQL business is just an amazing business for us. I mean this last fiscal year we crossed $5 billion mark and we grew 15 points, which is what 3x Oracle, and 2x the market. And so we are now \u2013 I mean we\u2019ll always add usage share leaders, but for the first time now sort of revenue share is growing and Kevin referenced that. And so we have crossed IBM in revenue share and we are gaining share versus Oracle even on the revenue share front. So that\u2019s just a fantastic growth story for the company. But the story behind it is the technology and what\u2019s happened is we\u2019ve become much more competitive on the high end. So SQL Premium growth is being fueled by the fact that we have all time peaks in terms of mission-critical workloads coming onto SQL. And then we lead when it comes to self-service BI. So on the edge, because you have lots of data doesn\u2019t mean you have insight. So in fact, it leads to fueling of the warehouses on the edge, and Excel, and SharePoint, and so that loop is something that is really vibrant for us and we see the growth. And we are adding to it.\nSo we have now added Hadoop capabilities in Azure as well as the distribution for Windows Server. This cloud BI, our Power BI service is just an amazing service for us. It\u2019s got natural affinity to both Azure and Office 365. So we are very excited that\u2019s going to launch now. And then SQL Server 14 is going to be a pretty big step forward. It\u2019s going to have an in-memory database, which we have always had when it comes to analytics now in the core engine. So that means you are going to see something like 7x, 10x increases in speed of your core OLTP applications without having to rewrite them. And that I think is going to be a very, very important value proposition that resonates with our customers.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nPerfect, thank you. So Terry, how about Windows and the enterprise, what are you seeing?\nTerry Myerson - Executive Vice President, Operating Systems Group\nWith Windows, we are continuing to see strength and commitment from the enterprise. Kevin talked about our progress in migrating customers off of Windows XP. Now, we have 75% of all enterprise desktops running Windows 7 and that contributed double-digit growth in the Windows volume licensing business contributing over $4 billion in revenue last year. The Windows 8.1 release that\u2019s becoming available now has had a strong focus on the enterprise both bringing back sort of the familiarity of Windows for productivity work, bringing back start button, revitalizing the desktop for that core Office user, but also focusing on innovations for the enterprise, great improvements in biometrics for customer IT departments that are looking at adding that layer of security. We also have some great work to support the IT challenge by bring your own device trends, supporting remote business data wipe on all Windows 8.1 devices. So with everything we do in Windows, we have this focus to making sure that Windows is that great enterprise desktop for productivity work, as well as any other form of desktop deployment that an enterprise might have for data entry kiosks, whatever it might be. We want Windows to be that most secure, most manageable lowest TCO way to deliver that desktop experience.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nGreat, thank you. Qi, I will ask you about Office 365 in business, what are we seeing?\nQi Lu - Head, Applications and Services Group\nYes, we see tremendous momentum for Office 365. And just to build on what Satya said, Terry said, I believe KT also talked quite a bit about it, we are growing at a very, very rapid pace. And last quarter our run rate was about $1 billion annual run rate. Now, this quarter it\u2019s already moving up at the run rate of $1.5 billion annual run rate and it\u2019s continued to accelerate. It\u2019s very, very strong. And it\u2019s available in 125 markets already. And over the last 12 months, among small and medium-sized business we grew 150%. And some of the specific products, for example, Yammer, now it\u2019s fully integrated as part of Office 365. Worldwide, we have over 200,000 organizations signed up for using the Yammer, and there is more than 1 million registered users for that products, it\u2019s social fabric for our future generation of enterprise productivity suite delivered through the cloud. So there is tremendous momentum.\nThere is a couple of things I do want to emphasize on this. One is the way we can drive product innovations for the generations to come, because that\u2019s part of building of cloud. And we have this concept of evergreen customers, because in the on-prem world upgrading to a new version to get new features is so hard, a lot of work. Now anytime we ship new innovations all our customers gets the benefit immediately. But even more importantly, the cloud you can observe what a customer does immediately, the pace of innovation picks up with cloud-scale infrastructures and the machine learning capabilities. There is so much more we can drive based on what we learned from our enterprise customer base to drive future product innovations.\nAnd one more thing I want to emphasize is the engineering muscles, and this is truly one of the great stories that are unfolding because our engineering teams is going through this massive transformation. They have deep know-hows, years of knowledge on how productivity works, how enterprise workloads work, how our customer use our products. Now, we are going through the hard journey of moving them to the cloud and building strong service muscles. And we are going through the transformation so that you technologically go to next generation, but our customers are going through this very smooth migration path. So the net, this is truly a strong, strong locomotive. I really want to leave with you with that particularly important concept. It\u2019s a very, very strong locomotive with lot of growth on business. It\u2019s going to be a future earning for Microsoft with a lot of power and with engineering muscle, with new way of driving innovation for enterprise. And this locomotive can carry many strategic payloads for our company for years to come. So it\u2019s quite exciting for this to happen.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nGreat. Yes, thank you all three of you. And Kirill, maybe I will ask you a two-part question. Terry talked about 8.1 for enterprise and the focus there. I know that probably means something to you as well. And then I will also ask you about cloud-based enterprise apps and where you see the future there and how you think about that for the growth of dynamics and what opportunity you see?\nKirill Tatarinov - Corporate Vice President and Head of Business Solutions Group\nRight. Well, it\u2019s a tremendous growth area for the company. And as Kevin noted earlier today, we have pretty phenomenal assets in the market and we have also \u2013 we also see tremendous opportunity for the future. Dynamics CRM was essentially one of the first services we delivered in the cloud to the enterprise in a way it blazed the path to all of the Microsoft moving into the cloud. Dynamics CRM also pioneered our approach to the cloud, where essentially our customers can run the same solution, from fully multi-tenant Microsoft cloud partner hosted also deployed on their own services and private cloud on-premises. Now, today two out of three new customers choose Microsoft cloud as their preferred deployment option, but those customers also tell us that, that choice is very important to them, especially those customers who got burned by salesforce.com and switched to Dynamics CRM tell us that. Now overall Dynamics CRM business has been tremendous growth story, 36 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, over 40,000 customers, 3.5 million users, it\u2019s a growing business at scale and we are really proud of what we accomplished there. We are also proud and excited about the opportunity to take share from all of Oracle and salesforce.com in that market.\nNow in Dynamics ERP which in and of itself is over $1 billion business for us today. We actually see small organizations increasingly looking for cloud as a deployment option. And that\u2019s why we have Dynamics GP and Dynamics NAV, our SMB solutions now delivered on Azure with our partners, who essentially put their industry vertical solutions on Dynamics on the Windows Azure platform, great win for platform, for our applications, for our partners, for our customers and yet again, it\u2019s a full flexibility of the mode of the deployment. And next year our flagship Dynamics AX will be offered in the same manner for larger organizations. So overall, I would say it has been a great story.\nWindows 8 is tremendous opportunity for us to bring business solutions in a modern application fashion to the enterprises. In fact, next month Dynamics CRM 2013 which is a major user experience release for us, a major push in this modern applications, will be delivered. It will run in this native modern app fashion and we have received tremendous feedback from customers and partners who have seen this application. So it\u2019s a great business as increasing number of our enterprise customers add Dynamics to their line-up of products from Microsoft, we see our role as trusted advisor to the enterprise getting much stronger. We see our overall share of wallet in the enterprise grow very significant and overall opportunity for growth is phenomenal.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nThat\u2019s great, that\u2019s great. Thank you very complementary to what Kevin talked about in terms of trusted advisor. Alright, so Rick Sherlund had a question which is also on a lot of your mind and that has to do with apps. So as a leadership team this is something we talk a lot about for sure, but Terry, I will have you take this one. And maybe start by talking about some of our progress and how we are thinking about the opportunity ahead? I think talking about both would be good.\nTerry Myerson - Executive Vice President, Operating Systems Group\nWell, as Tami said, this really is a significant area of focus for our leadership team and my team in particular. We understand where we are at. We have a plan. We are making progress, and we think we are going to be a leader here as we execute our plan. The signs of progress are pretty significant there. With Windows Phone, we now have 49 of the top 50 apps. With Windows 8, we are seeing great apps, which really take advantage of the platform from great brands, Facebook app, Twitter app, Foursquare app really taking advantage of the Windows 8 platform as they bring their apps to both tablets and PCs.\nOur developer programs just keep growing and keep getting better. We just released Windows 8.1 to the web. Great tools are coming, which really facilitate differentiated apps being built very efficiently. We just had our developer conference in San Francisco. Thousands of developers came to learn how they can take advantage of the platform. We are lowering our fees for developers, introducing competencies for developers to recognize publicly those ISVs that have shown the capability to produce great Windows apps. So we really are working our (indiscernible) on this locally, globally. We are looking at all of it. We are looking at domains for ISVs. We are looking at consumer apps. We are looking at enterprise apps. We are looking at how the virtuous cycle works on other platforms, how it should work on our platform. And it really is a top priority for me and my team and we are working it.\nSatya Nadella - Executive Vice President, Cloud and Enterprise Group\nSo one thing I would add is when we think about the platform as Terry and team are working on even bringing all our client platforms together and the tooling around it is in fact going to facilitate a lot of the sharing of the assets for the developers, which is very, very important for us. But there is no application that gets built today in the enterprise or in the consumer space that doesn\u2019t have a huge cloud element. In fact, even Office 365 is a programming surface area. So we are really building out our tooling across all of our assets and enabling these developers to exploit our broadest platform. And I think that\u2019s another source of innovation around our platforms that I think will translate into sort of unique app experiences for our platforms.\nJulie Larson-Green - Executive Vice President, Devices and Studios Group\nAnd we have all that work going on for our game developers as well to take advantage of the cloud. So multiplayer gaming is incredibly important and you have these very powerful endpoints that people can play their games on, but you need the truth in the cloud, and so Azure now helps developers take advantage of that and create these very high-quality applications that can use the power of the cloud both for state and keeping a sense of the universe between these multiplayers but also to offload computing.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nGreat. And speaking of Azure that was also a common question through all that you inputted, Brent Thill had this one. He said how will you differentiate your cloud infrastructure versus Amazon\u2019s? So Satya, that\u2019s yours.\nSatya Nadella - Executive Vice President, Cloud and Enterprise Group\nYes. So when we think about Azure, in fact, Qi said it well when he sort of started talking about Office 365. We really don\u2019t conceptualize Azure in its isolation. In fact, we think about the Microsoft cloud as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics, all coming together. If you think about it, any customer who has signed up for Office 365 effectively has also signed up for Azure, because the Azure AD or the Active Directory gets populated for every tenant of Office 365. SharePoint extensions, so you build a SharePoint application in Office 365 while its extensions are in Azure. You buy any of our server products, you get Azure with it. So you have backup, you have Hyper-V replica for disaster recovery.\nIf you buy SQL Server, you can have read-only secondaries in Azure. You get Visual Studio, you get to do source code control in the cloud, you do build in the cloud, project management in the cloud, and not only that, we also package up all of what we do in Azure as part of our server product. In fact, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving some of our server products\u2019 premium growth in build-out of private clouds because we really want a vision where distributed computing will remain distributed going forward. And that means we need to be able to even support people who want Azure functionality in their own datacenter. So we are pretty unique in all of these fronts when it comes to in comparison to Amazon. In fact, Amazon also carries a bunch of our workloads and is a reseller of some of our workloads. But as far as we are concerned, it\u2019s about really coming, bringing the assets I talked about together in unique ways for both IT as well as developers.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nThat\u2019s great. Good. Alright, I have got one more question that I am going to ask of you. So I will tell the audience that if you want to think about questions, we have microphones that will come to you, so if you just raise your hand. When you ask your question, if you wouldn\u2019t mind just standing up so we can see you and introducing yourself briefly that would be super helpful. So get ready. This is the last question. We have got a number of different questions asked in a number of ways, but essentially all asking about the Nokia deal and how we are thinking about that. And so no surprise that, that\u2019s of particular interest. And so maybe we will tackle this in a couple of different ways. Terry, I think it would be good for you just to talk about it from an engineering perspective. You are closest to that, have been closest to that team. So what will be different, how do we think about what the advantages will be having the team part of our team?\nTerry Myerson - Executive Vice President, Operating Systems Group\nWell, I am pretty excited about having the Nokia folks as part of our team. It\u2019s really just from the point of view of accelerating innovation, and really trying to produce these really epic devices. When it comes time to collaborate on creating these great devices with any of our partners, which is what my team does. It works with all of our partners to try and bring the innovations on to Windows. There is times where you get to that hardware/software boundary where sometimes having two companies, there is just the company boundary gets in the way of the collaboration. And we are moving that seam. I mean, we have this proven ability to work together with the Nokia team. It\u2019s a great team. But sometimes that seam between the companies has slowed progress or sometimes hindered and what we could get done. And so removing that seam I think really will enable new things and not just for the first-party devices from Microsoft, but also as we invest in that software, all of that software makes its way back into the platform, at least the platform components, which we then make available to all of our partners. So I foresee even better, more compelling, more innovative hardware support coming from our platform and more epic devices coming from Nokia as a result.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nGreat. And I think on the integration side I would just remind folks that at the time we announced the deal we actually had integration executives that had already been named and have been mobilized. And so we think that\u2019s a great running start just to make sure that everything is successful once everything closes. On the marketing side, I think we have tremendous opportunity to not only be more efficient, whether it\u2019s sort of brand synergy that can just be cleaned up and taken care of or whether it\u2019s just more effective marketing, because the teams are working together and really going after this family of devices that we talk about, this Windows family of devices.\nJulie Larson-Green - Executive Vice President, Devices and Studios Group\nWell, I think it actually says a lot about improving our commitment and capacity to hardware. I don\u2019t know how many of you know, but one of our very first hardware products was in 1980 called SoftCard, and not too long after that in 1983 we did the Mouse. And those are always in service of completing a software experience. And now we have the opportunity with the acquisition of Nokia to go and do a hardware first based experiences and really deliver our software and services through the hardware. And so instead of kind of turning it inside out, instead of being in service of the software, the hardware is leading where we are going to go in innovation.\nTami Reller - Executive Vice President, Marketing\nGreat, thank you. Alright, it\u2019s up to you now. Questions, and we have got numbers and I think I will just go to those numbers. So number two.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nJohn DiFucci - JPMorgan\nHi. It\u2019s John DiFucci from JPMorgan. I have a question for Kirill. Kirill, I know you don\u2019t break out the Dynamics business within MBD, but along the way some of the information that\u2019s been given by Microsoft gives me the idea that you have had significant growth in this business. I guess since it\u2019s the time of change at Microsoft, even with that growth, the way you depend on the channel not only for sales and implementation, but even support, I wonder if that business can ever be meaningfully profitable. So since it\u2019s a time of change, has there been any thought to go-to-market strategy for the Dynamics business, at least to I don\u2019t know if any channel partners are listening, but taking some of the support back, which is hugely profitable?\nTami Reller\nSo Kirill, it sounds like just a good straightforward question.\nKirill Tatarinov\nIt sounds like it\u2019s directed right at me.\nTami Reller\nI think it\u2019s you.\nKirill Tatarinov\nAnd I know this group has been asking the question about profitability of Dynamics business for the longest time. And I can only ask that I am quoting you this business is meaningfully profitable and there is a way to run this vibrant partner channel that we have, channel that is really an envy of all of our competitors. There is really a way to run that channel at scale and at the same time run this business as a profitable business for the company.\nTami Reller\nRight.\nJohn DiFucci - JPMorgan\n(Inaudible) of the corporate overhead, it\u2019s still I mean\u2026\nTami Reller\nI mean, our channel has given us scale and growth.\nKirill Tatarinov\nAnd our channel has given us an amazing marks. Our partner satisfaction in Dynamics has been growing dramatically in the course of last two years and it\u2019s actually at its peak right now.\nSatya Nadella\nAnd every Dynamics sale is a sale of our entire stack of Microsoft and that channel is a pretty vibrant channel for a lot of our infrastructure products as well.\nTami Reller\nGreat, thanks John. Let\u2019s go to one.\nWalter Pritchard - Citi\nHi. Walter Pritchard from Citi. Just wanted to follow up on the first question that was asked about the Office business or the MBD business, and you talked about the strategy around moving that to other devices. And I think most of us would argue here that really not a first class \u2013 the other devices aren\u2019t really first class citizens for non-Windows devices with those properties. And I think everybody uses iPads Notes. You know there is new information worker type applications being used whether it's Evernote, Dropbox, whatever it maybe, and you put up stats showing SharePoint and all these businesses growing nicely, but it does feel like under the covers there is kind of a groundswell of a competitive alternative building around your MBD sort of stack of products for lack of a better word.\nAnd I am wondering how you think about it, I understand how you are thinking about it. You explained it earlier, but I guess the risk in my mind is five years down the road you may find yourself in a situation where there has been sort of a competing ecosystem that\u2019s been built and is now heavily entrenched, maybe fragmented, but heavily entrenched in this area. And the slower you move with your own products as first class citizens on those platforms, the more you will sort of build that competitive ecosystem. I\u2019m just curious how you think about it from that perspective because we hear quite a bit of that thought process from investors?\nTami Reller\nWell, I mean, I do think that the way that Qi outlined it at the beginning really does describe how we think about it. We think about it from a customer perspective and we think about it from the economics from Microsoft\u2019s perspective. And that will always be the lens through which the team looks at it. Qi also added in timeline. We just \u2013 we will make sure that when there is a time for us to talk further about the roadmap, we will make sure we do so. But I think you covered everything in your first answer on that one. Alright, I will go to four.\nKash Rangan - Merrill Lynch\nHi. Thank you very much. Kash Rangan at Merrill Lynch. Sorry, can you hear me?\nTami Reller\nYes.\nKash Rangan - Merrill Lynch\nYou wanted me to stand up. Okay, let me stand up.\nTami Reller\nYes.\nKash Rangan - Merrill Lynch\nKash Rangan at Merrill Lynch. Thank you so much. My question is directed to Qi and Terry. Maybe you could talk about what exactly you are seeing with respect to the re-org. I mean, that\u2019s a pretty big step. It doesn\u2019t happen that often. How are you handling and coping with this, what are the specific actions you are taking in your individual businesses as far as the re-org is concerned. And secondly, if you could just comment on both you come from more of a consumer background, but you are going to be running enterprise scale products as well. And historically the issue that investors have and I also have thought about is the enterprise, you\u2019ve got enterprise tech companies, you\u2019ve got consumer tech companies. Only Microsoft tries to do both. And I wonder what thought is given to being able to release products at the right cadence for the enterprise market while not missing the beat on the consumer side. It would seem to be a fairly complicated exercise and you\u2019ve got a wonderful opportunity but I wanted to get your thoughts on that? Thank you.\nTami Reller\nAlright. Nice job packing a lot into one question. So let me maybe start with you, Qi, and get more focus on the first part, and then we can expand, which is how have you gone about really operationalizing the reorganization. And at a high level I would say as a common theme across this entire lineup is there has been this balance which Terry talked about, which is executing on current business and product delivery while we get ready to set up to really take the next big transformation. So do you want to bring that to life, Qi?\nQi Lu\nYes. That\u2019s a terrific set of questions. So I will just take maybe three parts to briefly comment on each of the areas. First is with regard to this re-org. It\u2019s important for us to remind there are three key components for my new groups Office, which is really the productivity suite, on-prem in the cloud, clients and services. The second is communications, Skype and Lync. And the third is the search engine information category suite of products. And they are very much having a commonality why these groups fit together, because if you take a step at the high level, as KT talked about, our company\u2019s focus is to deliver high value scenarios, to enable our customers, our users to do things that really they care about, of high value to them. And that central theme is to enable our customers to be able to get more done. Do more is the theme. And certainly Office is at the center of do more. And we always do things in conjunction, in combination of collaboration with somebody else. So communications always is also at the center of do more activities, high-value scenarios.\nAnd then what about Bing and it\u2019s important to emphasize Bing from the get-go, we took a different point of view. We said people search with a purpose in mind. You never search just for search sake, you have something, some purpose, some task in mind. So we want to change the search paradigm, drive innovation so that we enable our users to get things done. And there are infrastructures, there is data, there is machine learning. All these assets can come together to truly enable us to deliver the next generation workload. So that\u2019s the common themes.\nWith regard to how they all come together, it\u2019s a combination of the two. So each of our teams, they all have a strong roadmap. We ask all the teams to stay focused, full speed ahead, because we all have strong, strong products in the org and I want to ship all those. At the same time, we do need to work together in a thoughtful process to say how these assets can come together in a very, very organic, coherent way so that we can truly deliver the next phase of high value experiences. So we are in the midst of going through all those activities. The teams stay focused and my leadership team, myself, we spend a lot of time to come together to say what are the new opportunities in front of us we can do. So that\u2019s on the re-org side.\nAnd I\u2019ll also maybe briefly cover the previous question about what about the new scenarios, and that\u2019s really on our radar screen. We watch very, very closely about what\u2019s going on in the Silicon Valley. For example, there is a lot of startups innovating the new type of productivity scenarios. We pay full attention to all those, because we believe these are our opportunities to take our current core customer base and not only take that customer base and give them new experiences, but enable us to find, discover those new scenarios that you can use phones, tablets, using natural interaction models to have different ways of doing productivity scenarios, whether it\u2019s note-taking, meetings, communications, expressions, reading. There is all kinds of different opportunities on our radar screen. As part of this all comes together we really think there is great opportunities for the new org, in particular in collaboration with Terry\u2019s team and Satya\u2019s team to take that on.\nSo one last thing I do want to briefly comment about, the leadership question that you mentioned, because Terry and I, as you said, come from more of a consumer focused background because we have been building products in those areas. And the simple thing I would just briefly mention is one is you always start with a strong leadership team. I can say this I am truly blessed with very, very strong leadership teams, truly fantastic. They are all well-versed in enterprise workloads, and I learn a ton. And as I said earlier Office 365 is one of the \u2013 such a powerful locomotive that would drive many generations of new enterprise products for years to come for our company.\nAnd I spend a lot of time reviewing with technologies, working with the teams, because learning is important. It\u2019s always about teams, and I would learn as much as we can, because it\u2019s core to our company in the future to have strong, strong cloud infrastructures, strong, strong way of focusing our businesses on the enterprise side. At the same time, it\u2019s always about building strong teams so that the collective wisdom, the collective experiences, particularly in partnership with people like KT, Kirill and Satya, they all have a lot of enterprise experiences. So the net of it is learning as fast as we can, on-boarding, work with the teams and unleash the team collective power so that we can truly deliver the next generation of high value experiences and take our products and the businesses to the next level. That\u2019s at the high level to kind of answer your questions.\nJulie Larson-Green\nIf I could add on to that, one thing \u2013 I have been at Microsoft for 20 years, and one thing that is different is just the leadership team that is up here and how we are working together. And so we are all invested in each other\u2019s success and need to work together to deliver these high value experiences across a set of devices to our customers. And so we are working in a new way. We all have various amounts of enterprise experience. Terry worked on Exchange, I worked in Office for a third of my career. So we all have things to offer to each other to help us be stronger in our own individual parts that we are working on, but how it comes together is really where we see the magic and the synergy going forward.\nAnd as far as getting into the enterprise, we do believe that consumers drive a lot of what\u2019s coming into the enterprise. When I was in Office, Excel was brought into the enterprise because consumers liked Excel and brought it in over Lotus Notes. We see the same thing \u2013 we have seen the same thing with the iPad. Consumers have the iPad and bring it into the business. So we think these end points of these desirable, high quality devices, combined with the power of our high value scenarios and services is what\u2019s going to propel us forward into reaching customers the way we would like to.\nTami Reller\nGreat.\nTerry Myerson\nThis is sort of ironic for me because I think five years ago at FAM someone walked up to me and said, you are an enterprise guy, why would you be working on phones now? So it just shows I think there is so much about \u2013 at least it\u2019s true of pretty much so many things, whether it would be the applications or the devices, it is common between the consumer and the enterprise environment.\nJulie Larson-Green\nWe make products for people.\nTerry Myerson\nYeah and it\u2019s really the key thing. I think that so much applies to both, whether the user experience, the reliability, there is just a lot common across there. And so I think we are fortunate to be able to apply both domains across. And certainly for Windows, Windows is very much an enterprise product I would say, and it is very much an end user product. There is so much of our effort, the Windows we build is used on the client, it\u2019s used in the cloud, it\u2019s used in datacenters. And so having that diversity is essential to delivering the Windows franchise for Microsoft.\nTami Reller\nGreat and that was a rich question. You asked about cadence, and clearly 8.1 is a good example of what a great cadence can get. Let me go here and then I\u2019ll get to these 3 questions. Number one?\nPhil Winslow - Credit Suisse\nHi. This is Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse. It\u2019s a question for Qi. I appreciate the fact that some of the learnings from the consumer internet side have helped probably things like Azure and the build-out of that, but when you think about the profitability of the OSD division on a standalone basis, couple of FAMs ago, you gave out this target of maybe you hit 20% share and that\u2019s when we hit breakeven in OSD. I am wondering if you could just walk us through what\u2019s sort of the new thinking sort of the path to profitability is there and sort of what targets we are going to hit or just high level, just kind of how you think about that path? Thanks.\nTami Reller\nMaybe very high level, Qi just given time just a high-level view.\nQi Lu\nYes, so just briefly, we are making good progress. Thank you for the questions. One is we are gaining shares. Number two, we are driving innovation, so we have a set of product ideas we think truly differentiate our search experiences. In Windows 8.1 for those we haven\u2019t tried it we have a complete new way of seamlessly integrating search with information enriched on the devices. Terry\u2019s team, Julie\u2019s team used to be our former teams we are able to build that. We have very good set of ideas to truly disrupt today\u2019s search model. But your question is about profitability. For my organizations, we are hardcore. Essentially we are absolutely committed, always monotonically making progress towards profitability (indiscernible). Volumes we are gaining share, we obviously have more volumes, great. Last year, one of the best stories for my division is we are growing year-over-year at very, very high percentage. Finally, our R&D, our product, go-to-market truly coming together, we are growing our search rate at the very rapid pace. So great question, the team is hardcore executing. We have full confidence we are going to get there.\nTami Reller\nGood, thank you. One last question, we\u2019ll go to two.\nEd Maguire - CLSA\nHi. It\u2019s Ed Maguire from CLSA. You have articulated how you have harmonized all of your enterprise services, so it\u2019s actually very simple for your customers to move from one product to the other, but in the consumer, there are lot of different constituencies, Xbox, Skype, you have the Windows Store, a lot of different ways to get your services to consumers. And I am interested how the team is thinking about harmonizing that experience or getting a more consistent experience across all of your different offerings and how you can tie that into a business model that may go beyond devices where you control the platform?\nTami Reller\nYou want to take it? Yes, Terry, do you want to maybe take that one?\nTerry Myerson\nI can try to start.\nTami Reller\nYes.\nTerry Myerson\nI mean, we want over the family of devices with a family of services. When we think about delivering that family of services that really is we approach that bottoms up and top down. Bottoms up, we are embracing Azure in everything we do, and Azure broadly defined, that brings with it a number of capabilities, which actually project all the way out to the end user. Likewise coming out top down, adopting common design language, adopting common navigation, adopting common taxonomy, we are absolutely committed to that and are making great progress across all the application and services we build. And so Skype just joined our family recently. Bringing that in, I think the integration has actually gone fabulous in terms of that technology and that team, but it takes a little bit of time to integrate an asset in that scale. That\u2019s how we are approaching it and we are making good progress I think.\nTami Reller\nAnd as we go to market, we really think about consumer services. The Skype CMO is now the CMO for all of our consumer services and really thinking about how we make that more seamless as we go to market as well, so a lot of opportunity.\nSatya Nadella\nThe one thing I would sort of say is I think, this was referenced earlier, but there is this graduation process right, which is from consumer to enterprise that is actually the thing that we are probably the most focused on, which is what does it mean to have SkyDrive, SkyDrive Pro, what does it mean to really have these experiences where there is viral adoption even in the enterprise of our consumer products. And that\u2019s a place where things like Yammer has taught us a lot and that\u2019s something that I think you will see in a lot of our product design. This notion that this is an enterprise product and this is a consumer product I think is not the way we will approach things. We will think about these products as sort of meeting end user needs and enterprise IT needs and how to balance that.\nTami Reller\nGreat. Well, please help me in thanking our panel. Thank you to Qi, Kirill, Terry, Satya and Julie. Thank you very much guys. I also want to thank you for the questions that were pre-submitted and the ones we were able to get to here. These guys will join the reception. So I know you may have some additional questions, which I invite you to ask them at the reception as well. So it is now my great pleasure to introduce our next speaker who I would say has hit the ground running as the Microsoft CFO. She is a terrific partner to marketing, very pragmatic and hands-on, which I think you will see. So please help me in welcoming to stage Amy Hood. Thank you.\nAmy Hood - Chief Financial Officer\nThank you. Thank you. Hi. I have to say I wasn\u2019t envisioning a power outage when I thought about things to be worried about in our communications with you guys today. So thanks for your patience as we worked through that. You know, I do have a lot of ground to try to cover in 30 to 40 minutes, but I wanted to start out by saying this is the first step. It\u2019s the first step in how we communicate the transition we are going through. It\u2019s the first step in how we communicate the accountability we see and feel with the business and I feel. And so I want to sort of set that groundwork before we start.\nReally, I am going to give a little bit of an introduction. A little bit to me and a little bit about how I think you should expect and hear from me and how I talk and accountability. And I think rather than telling you math numbers, it\u2019s probably one of the most important ways we have to start building our relationship. So I will take a few minutes to do that. Then no fear, we\u2019ll dive right in, talk about business model transitions and try to give you two good examples that you have been asking for in terms of helping you know where now we were making progress and be able to see it more clearly and understand the gross margin opportunity we have in that transition. And finally, I will talk about the changes we are going to make to our reporting segments. To give you more insight and accountability in terms of the new businesses we are getting into and the gross margin profiles of those businesses.\nSo with that, let me kick off. I am probably not the first CFO to stand up and say I am focused on shareholder value. So let me tell you uniquely what that means to me. At Microsoft and at many tech companies, the greatest shareholder value has always been created by great innovation, where technical innovation and business model innovation come together. The thing I called that is strategic resource allocation. That\u2019s a word a finance person uses to say, invest in the right places where you see those opportunities and do it thoughtfully, prioritize, look at ROI, look for economic value and invest behind it. And second is really about more of the short-term. If the first is the long-term and how you create the most shareholder value, it certainly should also be noted that day-to-day execution and excellence and operational and financial management matters. It matters is about execution. Achieving great technical and business model innovation requires great day-to-day execution. You don\u2019t have to just do one or just do the other at a company like this.\nAnd of course, cost discipline, I think about cost discipline as really being how do I get the most out of every dollar we spend. The reorg is a great example. We are already seeing it by making centers of excellence otherwise known as a functionally organized team. You can see even after a few months where we are making a greater impact. You saw some of the ads. Our ads are already more consistent. You think back a few years, you probably would have seen three ads in succession, not terribly related to each other. The ads you are already seeing after eight weeks are about one single Windows experience, one single consumer experience. And capital return, earlier this week, we announced a 22% increase in our dividend and a $40 billion buyback program. I think you will continue to see that as a key focus. I know it\u2019s a priority for you. It is certainly a priority for me and for the board and for the company.\nNow, let me turn a little bit to me, not the company. I want you to know what to expect day-to-day from me. Engagement, I think if you ask a lot of people inside the company, they would probably make the same list for me. So you should know I am probably the same here as you would find me in my office a mile or two away. I do believe in engagement inside on product plans, capacity planning. I believe in meetings to make decisions, to drive outcomes, and I also believe in engaging with you all in a consistent way.\nDecisiveness, in a business that changes as quickly as ours, being able to make thoughtful, but quick decisions is important. It\u2019s my job as the CFO to think everyday about how I can have the leadership team together, have the right data and insights to make the best decisions as quickly as we can to move forward, to drive the strategy we are trying to drive.\nAccountability, you know sometimes when we reorged, I often heard, gosh, it seems like where did the accountability go? Well, the answer is I think everybody feels deeply accountable to one their function in a world class way. And I feel an accountability to report on that progress both to you and to my peers. It\u2019s important, because it builds credibility and it also builds awareness. And insight, my job to you and inside the company is to provide insight on the opportunity we have, our ability to execute on it, and the actual ability to show you in our numbers the insight into the day-to-day environment we see.\nSo with that, my guess is you are more interested in this part of the session. So we will move on to the business model transformation. I tried to simplify some of the questions I have been asked by each of you and on the calls and in my old job. Help me understand where you are Microsoft in this model. We know the Microsoft that was on the left. A company that made a royalty on PCs generally made a license on consumer software and sold licenses into IT departments in the enterprise. The model we are already shifting to which Kevin really talked a lot about this presentation was moving to a device business that\u2019s still royalty-based, but also gross margin based, an enterprise service business that\u2019s licensing and subscription and a consumer service space that\u2019s advertising and subscription based.\nWhere are we? We are on our journey. And I think our goal today is to point out where we are in some very important examples. When you think about the importance of moving from the left to the right, it\u2019s because the opportunity is larger. There are more devices than there are PCs. There is more services and consumer applications than Office. And there are certainly more enterprise services that we can provide than even our $12 billion businesses that we have already created achieve. There are trillions of dollars spent today in IT. The model on the right allows us to access far more. And so that is why when we talk today, it\u2019s all about the transition to a bigger place.\nWith that, let me start and explain some of our first examples. I want to introduce our new vocabulary here at Microsoft. We are sort of used to using different words, but I would say this is the language we now use. It\u2019s a language about everyday excellence and opportunity around operational excellence, operational excellence everyday, every week, every month, every year, these are the words that make it great. This is the language we use in the field that Kevin uses, it\u2019s the language we use in engineering, it\u2019s the language we use in finance. I think if you expand and say, gosh, looking back over the past year, where are some things we could have done better? There are probably things on this list and there are things we are focused on, but we have to be great at these as we go through these business transitions we are going to talk about.\nLet me move to the consumer services section. You may not realize it, but currently in consumer services and applications today, we have a $15 billion business. It\u2019s an incredibly strong base far beyond that of just Office to move to the future. We built Xbox LIVE and the gaming business. We built communications business, a search business. We have clearly grown our productivity business. We have a storage business. But the future and is actually asked in the Q&A today was around combining many of those experiences to create end-to-end solutions.\nWhen you sell end-to-end solutions and you do it in the cloud, you give day-to-day value that people want to subscribe to. They see your latest innovation in the moment. They know that you are an innovator. They understand where you are going as a company. Putting these assets together creates a big opportunity to move our subscription business forward as we complete some of the core scenarios you have heard us talk about today, whether it\u2019s social, whether it\u2019s task completion, whether it\u2019s a better way to express yourself beyond simply PowerPoint.\nActually, as a consumer, I think I am two things, I am a consumer apparently a worker, and I was supposed to use different things. I use one thing. And I want that thing to be the same whether I am having a meeting at home, meeting at work, these are the tools that are going to let us do that. They are the tools that are going to let us be successful both in the enterprise and outside of it. By combining these experiences, you heard Terry talk a little bit about it, it will let us grow both the consumer business and the enterprise business. You know, the example I get asked to talk about the most is Office 365, the transition from Office consumer to a Home Premium business.\nLet me jump into that. Most of you guys know this. Office today sell a license. We generally sell it at the time you buy a PC. You kind of buy it every 5, 7 years depending on how often you get to a store to buy a new PC. You may buy a new PC and use your old disk back in the prior world. And we recognized all that revenue technically upfront. With Office Home Premium, I will start with the most important thing, which is why it\u2019s a better product. The way you make actually more money is you make your customer really happy.\nThe best experience in Office Home Premium comes from the fact that it\u2019s always up-to-date. You get our best stuff the fastest. And like someone asked why don\u2019t we do a better job of integrating our products? When you buy an Office Home Premium subscription, you actually get rights to SkyDrive storage and Skype minutes, and we are already seeing increased usage from SkyDrive today from the deep integration into the product. It just works. You are able to go from device to device, finding your place in a PowerPoint deck that you had to close on a different machine. It follows you. It follows you, the consumer. It knows you across your devices. That actually brings meaningful value. And it also makes us seam because we are the innovation leader in productivity. People are no longer using services, otherwise known as a disk that\u2019s years old. You get our best stuff fast.\nSo what does that mean economically? Economically, even over a very short period of time, a little over two years, we are better off in this model, but it does mean as we said, and I give you example for Q1, in our guidance that we gave in July, $150 million of revenue that we otherwise would have recognized in the quarter goes to the balance sheet. Now, I am happy it\u2019s on the balance sheet. These are more profitable long-term customers than we have today. And they are going to be more engaged and ultimately happier with Microsoft product and with their experience. To me, this is sort of the easiest way to explain the benefit in this particular segment.\nI also want to give you an example in the enterprise. Again, I have to go into a short history lesson, which is that we were a company that basically sold Windows and Office into the enterprise. Then we used to come to these meetings and get asked if we could be a serious enterprise contender. We have built $12 billion businesses in the enterprise. Many of which are multi, multi-billion dollar businesses that you heard both Satya and Kevin talk about. That is such an impressive base and a foundation to drive into the next wave. It gives us an incredible base. We can continue to offer hybrid solutions and we can monetize at a higher rate.\nLet me actually give you the first framework of how I will walk you through this enterprise transition. I would say I think about it in sort of three key buckets. What things can you achieve by moving people to a service? Number one, and you will hear me use this framework quite a bit going forward, I have used it on Office 365 for a long time. First, it allows you to increase reach. What do I mean by that? New customers and new seats within existing customers, both opportunities, we have seen a 150% increase in small business customers in the past 12 months, and we already had 15% increase in our kiosk attach, think about that as a new user within an existing entity, already proving the first point.\nNext, increase the frequency. Now, this looks slightly different between an EA customer and what we call in our current disclosure a business transactional, someone who purchases once every now and then, but the outcome is the same. In a service model, where we prove and create value everyday, you should expect us to do better than our current 75% license renewal rate every time an EA subscription comes up for renewal every 3 years. We should do better than that, because we add new services. We should do better than that, because it\u2019s deployed. We should do better than that because we show value. If you do that, even from existing customers, you make more money. And by the way, they are happier.\nNext, small business, they tend to purchase as we said either infrequently, right or not at all. I already covered not at all, so 5, 7-ish years, maybe longer. In the service model, we should be able to do better than that for the same reasons. And probably more opportunity here on this particular dimension than there is in the enterprise. And next, increase the yield on an existing seat. We have two ways to do that. First, we can add services. You might say you maybe able to do that forever, you keep introducing new products. The difference is in a service model, it\u2019s far easier. Deployment is different. Adding services is different and it\u2019s easier. So the opportunity to do that more frequently and to continually add services with reduced cost because we run your IT for you is improved. We can also sell more premium versions of the workloads once they are deployed. So 75%, as you can see, of our enterprise customers have more than one workload. We can continue to do better than that. And we certainly have opportunity in selling our premium workloads. If you think about all three of these dimensions and you classify our customers into them that\u2019s the best way in your framework to think opportunity, opportunity, opportunity.\nWith that, let me give you an example. This was really only going to show one dimension mathematically, which is if I take an annuity customer, currently what we call Core CAL. The Core CAL gives you rights to Exchange, SharePoint and Lync and the standard versions of those SKUs. There is many things that are actually quite similar here, unlike in the consumer example. You know, billed annually, that's still true; recognized ratably, still true, we have always recognized our annuity contracts that way, no difference here. They are generally still 3-year commitments often and then a renewal, so not really accounting statement. The difference comes in our ability to up-sell. If we can actually take this customer and simply sell them the premium SKU of their existing workloads and Office 365, our gross margin percentage goes up 50% per seat.\nGross margin, the new language of the service business, revenue also goes up, gross margin, 50% growth. And that doesn\u2019t represent, it only gets better than that if we do any of the following: do better on churn and renewal, add other and new workloads, Azure identity, the new BI Power View that we\u2019ve just added as a module, incredibly powerful given Excel, Excel Services and SharePoint that Kevin touched briefly on and so if you think about that, that\u2019s why grayed \u2013 blued the top. We know we get a 50% gross margin improvement and it goes up from there.\nThe next example I will talk a little bit about is Azure. Azure is in an earlier state of the transition than Office 365. So here we know that we have a 3X improvement in our addressable market. We also know that business is a bit different. You have to address the opportunity in, I would say, 3 buckets for us. There is a consumptive model. Pay as you go, it\u2019s optimized to take advantage of elasticity, of availability in datacenter\u2019s capacity. People who simply want to try, and it also gives a low-end entry point for developers.\nThe second model is subscription-based. Subscription-based allows you to get a discount for commitment. That commitment helps us with capacity planning and demand planning, and so the discount makes sense. And we\u2019ve actually the licensing tool, where we can attach this with far more ease to our enterprise agreements, and in fact, I think we may not talk about this, but we have 2,500 EAs currently with Azure that\u2019s been attached to them. That is an incredibly helpful model for try, use, buy, and that model, then as we add new services adds more value.\nIn Azure, it\u2019s clear. There are some commodity workloads, and Satya did speak a little bit about, and we will probably have longer discussions at some point, about some of the high value-add services. If you compete at the commodity layer with an opportunity to sell at the high level, and we know those activities are connected, you can improve the gross margin profile of this business and move further and further up the stack. This is what we know how to do well because we run high end first party workloads on Azure. We know what high end workloads need. And I think that\u2019s our best opportunity to grow this business the fastest.\nI will also say this is one of the places that we are investing ahead of the curve. We talked a lot about capital expenditure, and I want to really be able to explain what we\u2019re doing. All the growth that we talked about for Q1 and now for FY \u201814 is investment directly in datacenters and servers. It\u2019s directly in the datacenters and servers globally to increase our footprint, to be able to take advantage of the Azure, Office 365 and consumer services opportunities we just talked about. This is required for us to grow the opportunity as fast as I think we can because of our competitive advantage. I do think it\u2019s important to remember with that $2 trillion opportunity, being the first to China, being the first with this type of global footprint with the Office 365 services we have, the Azure services we have, with the Office consumer profile we have, I think we will have a good return on this investment.\nWith that, I want to sort of change speeds a little bit from our examples. So what does all that mean? We have a lot of opportunity with this new model. We are investing to capture it, but more importantly we are creating economic value by doing it. And I think this is an example we will have to continue to walk you through as we make more progress in each business, but we will, and I think that\u2019s going to lead into the operating segments.\nWhen you think about introducing operating segments, financial reporting no one changes their reporting segments lightly. I know it\u2019s a lot of work for you. It is a lot of work for us. There is obviously the requirement. You should report the business the way your CEO manages the business. But beyond that, beyond that principle, our goal is to show the transitions in the business model we have just talked about clearly. The goal is to show the progress we are making on devices and services more clearly. And the goal is to show more accountability to the gross margin profiles we are changing.\nSo with that, let me move on to our 5 new reporting segments. We will have 5, just as we did before, and we will continue to have a corporate bucket, which I guess doesn\u2019t count as a real segment, but would make 6. We have hardware, licensing, other under a broader concept called devices and consumer. Then we have our commercial business with licensing and other, with others being enterprise services plus our enterprise services part two. One is people the other is actually Office 365 and Azure.\nWhat\u2019s important about this? Each of these categories have similar gross margin profiles. A hardware business is a different profile than our licensing business. It\u2019s a different profile than our services businesses here. You will see a disclaimer. There is far more information than I could ever cover in this presentation of what\u2019s in each segment, and so that will be available, we are also filing an 8-K to help explain some of this. But I think more importantly is for us to talk about what you should expect. We\u2019ll report revenue and gross margin for each of these segments. We will then report operating income for the two aggregations. Operating income where it is clearly and fully attributable to one of these areas will be directly put in that reporting segment. Where it\u2019s shared resourcing, our new re-org, it will be allocated by gross margin.\nWhat to expect. I didn\u2019t expect you guys to get all of that down in 2 minutes. However, I want to make sure we are all clear on what to expect from now till the earnings announcement in October. On September 26th, we will host a call. On the call, we will, before that, provide quarterly restatements for two years and walk you through those. We will do a more complete list of the new KPIs we\u2019ll provide to help you understand both the transition as well as some of the new businesses we have entered and the momentum behind them. We will also provide a Q&A session. Ask away. We will have both our controller on the phone as well as IR and you will get as much detail as we\u2019ll provide and take as much time as we need.\nBetween that and Q1 earnings, you are obviously welcome to ask as many questions of either me or the Investor Relations team as we need to for you to feel ready for October 24th. October 24th, all the financials, my commentary, will be reported in the new reporting construct, as will my outlook. However, we will also report all Q1 results in the old model as well as supplementary information as opposed to primary. That should allow us for a transition period as we continued to evolve your models and our guidance.\nWe won\u2019t provide any additional impact on Nokia just because it won\u2019t have closed. So I wouldn\u2019t expect any more guidance on that in Q1, so I wanted to just be clear in terms of setting expectations. You will have to listen on the call for the numbers. So why make a change this big? In some ways, it\u2019s hard. But adding accountability to our progress in all those areas, adding accountability to the gross margin of the investments we are making in CapEx, and giving you transparency on how we are doing in our devices consumer efforts, as well as our commercial business is important. It really reflects many of the questions I have been asked in the past 5 months. We can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening. We can\u2019t see when you are moving licensing dollars to services dollars. We can\u2019t see in the Windows business the commercial revenue versus OEMs. This should be able to make many of those health indicators more clear.\nSo what does that mean for FY \u201814 in my comments? I do expect FY \u201814 to continue to reflect the ongoing transition to the cloud. We said that from the beginning, that\u2019s not new. We have expanded our device portfolio, and by the end of FY \u201814, I hope we are the owner of Nokia. And we will continue to make the investments in the global datacenter footprint that I outlined today. With full confidence that capacity will be utilized by very happy customers. And finally, I will remind you that our FY \u201814 OpEx guidance is here. I sometimes think that we had a lot of change in the past 5 months. I say that as the new person, but I would say I stand here more confident than I did when I took the job that we are making the changes we need to make to drive economic value. We have added insight. We have added accountability. We have added clarity of our purpose. And we have put leaders in charge of businesses that can drive them forward.\nAt this point, I have the pleasure of turning the stage over to Steve, who I would say has been a great partner for me personally in these 5 months. I think there is no one who cares more about the success of this company than he does. And there is no one who has put more effort into setting us up for the future than he has. I greatly respect his leadership in my time. And more than that, I respect everything he has taught me about being excellent at something.\nSo with that, let me have you welcome Steve to this year\u2019s FAM. Thanks. Thanks.\nSteve Ballmer - Chief Executive Officer\nWell, thanks. I am glad to have a chance to be here. I am not exactly on schedule, but close to on schedule. We had that Super Bowl moment there earlier, and I was kind of wondering whether we were the Ravens or the 49ers in this event. I hope we are the winning team, so to speak.\nI want to talk to you today about the kind of state of Microsoft and my enthusiasm for where we are and where we are going, and because we have called this thing, at least my whole time at Microsoft, the so-called Financial Analyst Meeting, I thought I would start with some numbers. And the numbers aren\u2019t designed for any one purpose, although I think they will serve three purposes. Number one, we built a heck of a good company. Number two, we are aware that there are challenges in front of us. And number three, we are actually very well positioned for the biggest and most incredible financial upside that the company could dream about. And in some senses, you\u2019ve got to embrace all three of those things. You\u2019ve got to embrace success. You\u2019ve got to embrace the fact that there are headwinds in certain areas. And you\u2019ve really got to just \u2013 at least in my case, I am incredibly motivated and excited about the financial upside, let alone the upside for doing great new products.\nWhat I did here was sort of to collect information on seven companies, and these are all on the website. You can all study them later. And I am not going to crawl through every number, but I am going to make a few points. There are seven companies up here. Microsoft is the one that is very carefully boxed, so you can\u2019t lose it if you try. And then I wrote down three companies essentially who were born somehow on the consumer side and kind of what they look like financially.\nAnd I have got three companies that are born and live primarily on the enterprise side. I picked a couple of companies on both sides that actually make a ton of money. This group of people actually expects us to make a ton of money. I am not sure how much credit we get for something that grew quickly and made no money, but for completeness I will show that it\u2019s a path to creation of market value. If you will, all three of the companies on the right are real \u201centerprise companies\u201d in no way, shape or form would I say they touch the consumer. The three companies on the left were all born with the consumer, and yet particularly when you look at both Amazon and Google, both of those companies now are actually what I might refer to as three tool players. They are trying to be device companies, they are trying to be consumer services companies, and they are trying to be enterprise services companies.\nIn the case of Google, we certainly meet them with Google apps in the market everyday. They obviously are in consumer services business with search. And with what they are doing with Android and Chrome and their own devices let alone third-party devices, they are trying to compete in all three of those bubbles that Amy talked about. Same thing with Amazon, they compete in all three places. Microsoft successfully actually competes in both the consumer market today. You had a chance to see some of the numbers that Amy showed you on profitability of our devices and consumer services business. And we compete in a way that generates a lot of profit on the enterprise side.\nIf you take a look at some of the numbers, I am proud that we have made more money than anybody in this list in the last 10 years. If you take a look at the last 5 years, it is a great reminder that there is huge profitability in our industry in the devices business. Not everybody may make it, but it is a huge source of our profitability through Windows. It is a huge source of profitability for Apple. I don\u2019t list Samsung on here, because I am never quite sure how everybody else would view kind of Korean accounting standards. So I just left it out for complete \u2013 well, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s too complicated for me. But you take a look and you say okay, how have we done? We have done pretty well in profit, very well in profit, in fact. Even if you look at just the last year with the exception of Apple, we are the most profitable company on the list. If you look at dividends until Apple started a dividend, we are the biggest payout, now they have passed us we have just made our most recent increase.\nIf you look at cash returned to shareholders, last 10 years we kind of blow everybody away. And if you look at the last several years, IBM particularly through buyback has chosen to return cash. CapEx, you can take a look at this and you say, whether we are a devices company or a services company, CapEx levels are higher in the future than they were for us as a software company. Acquisitions, certainly the biggest thing we did in the last 5-year period, was the acquisition of Skype, but acquisitions have played a role for us and our competitors. And then you can see enterprise value, which to me is kind of a job one indicator. Cash, we are obviously moving to return increased amount of cash back to our shareholders, but we still nonetheless manage it knowing it\u2019s your cash, it\u2019s not our cash, it is your cash, it is my cash too, by the way, as a shareholder. And we try to manage it appropriately, although we are returning it in greater amounts than we have for the last several years. So we have been very successful. We make a ton of money. We are very proud of that.\nWindows, Windows has some challenges. For the first time over the last couple of years, Windows has done something other than just grow. And we understand the shift that\u2019s going on in the market. We understand the superior value that a PC brings to other devices in many forms of use. And we understand that there are reasons why people also like and appreciate tablets and phones, and those devices will continue to proliferate.\nYou can see it here. It\u2019s a sort of stark reminder that if we are going to continue to grow and prosper, we can look both to, if you will, the right and the left of us on this chart and say both devices and enterprise services companies make a lot of money. The one thing that\u2019s actually toughest is understanding how to make money as consumer service company. Google does it. They have this incredible, amazing, dare I say monopoly that we are the only person left on the planet trying to compete with. But other than that, most of the consumer services companies just don\u2019t make enough profit to really register at this scale, maybe Facebook will. People mentioned Dropbox, I noticed in the Q&A and Evernote.\nBut one of the things that we have really kind of taken note of from a profitability perspective we will be led by our work in the enterprise services and devices. We think that the greatest profit growth, it doesn\u2019t mean the greatest innovation; it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t do \u201cconsumer services,\u201d because they are important. They are important to the customer. They are a path to enterprise services. They are a path to device success. But in some senses we will lead as we go to market and we will certainly lead in terms of how we hope to generate profit through devices and through enterprise services.\nWhen I say devices, you should always hear virtual devices. I would refer to Windows PCs as a virtual device, since we don\u2019t actually make them. And you ought to hear physical devices, like the Xbox, like the Surface, and with the Nokia acquisition like the Lumia and other phones. So in a sense that\u2019s how I think about the business economically. I think we can grow. I will talk about what I think it takes to have us grow successfully and why I think we are well positioned. But, that\u2019s kind of the mental framework that I\u2019d encourage you to at least engage with me in to make your own evaluation.\nWhen we talked about our reorganization, in a sense the word re-org almost understated what we were doing. We were really clearly laying out a strategy that we want to pursue. We spent the last 6 months as a leadership team more engaged time wise than we have ever been, not sort of beating out what a reorganization looks like, but really fundamentally honing the strategy, the strategy first and foremost of focusing in on high value activities. There are all actually high-value activities and low-value activities. Although sometimes you will find that somebody\u2019s low value activity, somebody else\u2019s high-value activity, I certainly know teenagers who think using Facebook is a high value activity and yet that\u2019s not kind of the way we think about it.\nSo we said, look the place you create real money is when you do something that is really important to your customer. If you are not doing something that\u2019s really important to your customer, there is probably not a chance to make a lot of money. So we said what are some of these scenarios research and analysis, meetings, social, communications, well I talked about development, IT and data management, task completion. Task completion and you say, what\u2019s a task? And I say task is anything that people feel like they really have to get done. Now you can say that could be as simple as checking the weather. That might not be a high value task, but then you can think about things like, hey, I really have to figure out where we are going to go on this vacation and how much money I am going to spend. We really need to figure out who we are going to go see for this disease that some family member has been afflicted with.\nExpression, we talk about serious fun around here. I know a lot of folks in this room have a lot of opinions about the Xbox, but it is a high value activity to a certain community of people who spend hours and hours and hours. I was talking to a senior government official today and they would like us to provide some public service advertising on the Xbox. And this senior U.S. government official said to me, I don\u2019t really know much about the Xbox, but my chief of staff is 28 and he said don\u2019t worry, I spent at least 25 hours a week when I was in college on the Xbox. It\u2019s a place we need public service advertising, but in a sense I\u2019d call that serious fun, a place where people will really spend dedicated and purposeful time.\nIT and information assurance, customer interaction, there is one probably underlying thing that I should highlight is a high value activity, and that\u2019s getting the fundamental user interface for the device and the system right. Even routine tasks are facilitated by getting the basic sort of construct of the device right. And I might argue that almost all the money, a huge percentage of the money in our industry has been made on those transitions. The PC was a new user interface and a new form factor. And Intel and Microsoft made a lot of money. If you will, touch and low power was a huge change in the way the user interface paradigm worked. And Apple and Samsung and Qualcomm made a huge amount of money. We are not done seeing fundamental shifts in the user interface and kind of hardware approach to devices. And I believe that too represents a form of high value activity.\nHow do you monetize high value activities? Amy talked about the three bubbles: devices, consumer services, and enterprise services. The two that are most easily monetized, in fact, are devices and enterprise services. Consumer services, as we say, are tough. Other than phone companies, there really aren\u2019t many technology, large subscription consumer services, and outside of Google and maybe Facebook it is hard to find a business that is significant that is ad funded. So we look at these three bubbles, if you will, as places to land these high value services, and ways to monetize these high value services. We are also making, behind the scenes for all of these things, core investments in fundamental technology. The operating system, Terry talked a little bit about it. It\u2019s a core technology investment. There just aren\u2019t that many people left making fundamental operating system investments. UI innovation, as I pointed out, UI innovation is critical, because inventing the next hardware-software paradigm does create an opportunity to make a ton of money.\nMachine learning, at scale, it\u2019s hard to argue that, other than Google and Microsoft, anybody is making an at scale investment in helping develop technology that studies the world and studies the user and tries to help computers learn about people and serve them better. It is a scale game. It\u2019s a moat. There are really only two people who are making the investment. The investment in the cloud infrastructure, the investment in the technology, and I think it will be one of the defining characteristics of the next generation of device and user interface.\nAnd last, but not least, is cloud infrastructure. Cloud infrastructure to me, and this has become clear really over the last 4 years or 5 years, it\u2019s a pretty fundamental investment and it\u2019s not as simple as saying, let\u2019s go build a bunch of datacenters. It\u2019s really learning how you architect these things to be low cost and at scale. We used to design datacenters by thinking about servers. Now literally we designed the buildings as the unit of compute work in order to take cost and complexity out of the equation.\nGoogle, there is sort of this almost Dr. Strangelove kind of arms race that goes on, at least amongst people who operate datacenters. How many megawatts are they buying this year, that\u2019s sort of the way in which datacenters are rated. How many megawatts will Google put in? How many megawatts will we put in? And in a sense there is only really a couple or 3 companies that are really pursuing that at scale. Amazon is, we are, and of course Google is. But without these core technology strengths in the cloud, in machine learning, in hardware and software user interface design and the operating systems, I think we are a very different company. And the thing, as I\u2019ll talk about later, that makes me most excited is I think we are making the core investments, we are building out the applications that are most important, and we have got a clear view of how we want to take those to market and monetize those.\nNow, there is a lot there, and people could say, okay, well, that\u2019s a great framework, Steve, but it\u2019s here and now a baby and you guys have to deliver. So let me give you kind of 4 clear priorities. And at the end of the day when we want to put up the kind of slide in front of our 100,000 employees at a sales meeting or a company meeting, you\u2019ve got to simplify. And over the near term there are 4 things we\u2019ve got to get right. Number one, Office 365 and Azure have got to be a touchdown. They have got to have the innovation, they have got to have the differentiation, they have got to have the value, they have got to have the sales and marketing energy and support to really, really, really kick ass. They just have to.\nAnd the surge in Office 365 is actually quite amazing. We started this enterprise cloud investment about 8 years or 9 years ago. We took over running the knowledge worker infrastructure for Energizer, the battery people and we used that as a test lab and we built and grew from that position. And it\u2019s quite clear to me that by this time next year we will overwhelmingly have the most popular paid service in the enterprise, bar none. And we will have an engine really with Office 365 to which we can attach new services and new options, both for the IT department as well as for end users, marketing departments, etcetera, inside our customers.\nThe second area of focus is Windows PCs. We must do the job to ensure that the PC stays the device of choice for people when they are trying to be productive in life. It doesn\u2019t mean that people aren\u2019t going to buy some tablets to be productive, but if you look at the bulk of the tablet market today, it\u2019s moving actually to smaller tablets. Our OEMs in Asia oftentimes refer to those as entertainment tablets versus productivity tablets. We know that we have got to do a great job. Windows 8.1, I think is a very distinct improvement, and we are going to have to put time and energy, not only into Windows PCs, but into brand Windows overall. Our device brand more than anything is brand Windows, Windows Phones, Windows PCs, Windows tablets, and we have to make absolutely clear to people what the value proposition is and by the way how they can also get some of those same high-value services on non-Windows devices, on iPads, on iPhones, on Android devices, etcetera.\nMobile devices, we have almost no share. I don\u2019t know whether to say that with enthusiasm or kind of uncomfortable tension, but I am an optimistic guy. Anything we have low market share sounds like upside opportunity to me. We are paying to do it all day everyday. It\u2019s in all that OpEx that Amy talked to you about, so now it\u2019s just boom. It\u2019s getting after it and really making sure that we deliver the kind of revenue and gross margin upside that\u2019s certainly there. The Nokia deal has a lot of things. One of the things that it certainly is, is the way to make sure that we can actually capture the gross margin upside, because we are making most of the investment today that we need to make even owning Nokia. So we are very excited to have a chance to capture the gross margin upside by actually being the device provider, particularly given that Nokia already sells over 80% of the Windows Phones that gets sold around the world.\nAnd last but not least, we need to continue to innovate in high-value activities. When we get together as a leadership team, we are sitting there and talking about what are we going to do this year to improve the meeting experience, how quick is it for people to connect people remotely, how good does digital whiteboarding work, how good does the pen work as a tool for annotation and drawing and sharing in the meeting? I guarantee you if we can get just a couple or three of these high-value activities to explode and you had a chance to hear about some of those from the panel, that is absolutely at the end of the day the thing that\u2019s going to allow us to sell more enterprise services and the thing that\u2019s going to help suck through our consumer services and devices.\nWhen I take a look myself, now, this is me as an investor and I am preparing to be an investor here in the not distant future. I say, what does Microsoft really look like? Devices, we talked about PCs in Windows 8, the tablet in Surface, phones in Nokia, Xbox in the living room, the work that we are doing with this acquisition we made about a year or so ago called PPI, to do wall-sized computers for offices, I think is very powerful in terms of what it can mean strategically and economically. I look at all that and with perfect awareness that there are some headwinds and risks in the PC business, I look at that and say we have amazing, amazing short-term opportunities in devices.\nIn consumer services, it really gets down to two major monetization opportunities, Bing, and Bing has been performing very well. Year-over-year, our revenue per search is up, I don\u2019t know, 30% to 40%. Our search share continues to improve. We are getting smarter. We used to invest a lot of money in customer acquisition. Some of those deals were not as good as I wish they would have been. We are actually now saying what\u2019s our number one customer acquisition vehicle for Bing. It\u2019s actually Windows devices. We are making sure that we really get Bing well-designed into Windows and Windows Phones and Xboxes. We are making sure that those are first grade experiences. And we are making sure that they monetize better and better and better. So I am very pleased with the opportunity to improve our search advertising business.\nAmy talked a little bit about Office and Kevin talked a little bit about Skype for consumers, but essentially the way to think about it is through Office 365 Home Edition, do we have a way to not only convert the business that we have been doing with high-end consumers for Office for productivity on PCs, but do we really have a way for people who really value their time and energy to pay us more money? I will tell you a couple of stories.\nIf you look at the total base of consumer PCs that gets sold, about 60% of them get sold to consumers. Of that population, about 15% to 20% actually pay for Microsoft Office, some don\u2019t use it and some don\u2019t pay for it and I will be kind of silent as to what percentage is what, but let\u2019s say, piracy is certainly quite high. But when people are making that investment, whether it\u2019s a student, whether it\u2019s somebody who works out of their home, whether it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, somebody like my wife who is very busy in not-for-profits, the chance to get that customer to stay current to pay us more money, we are probably not going to get the least affluent person in the world to come with us on that journey. They will use the free stuff, but to the degree that people value their time and energy for productivity and communications, it\u2019s a heck of an upside.\nAnd then last, but certainly not least is the cloud and hybrid services. This is really important, because while the cloud is valuable in all the ways that Amy described, we still get plenty of customers for certain applications and workloads who are not prepared to fully embrace the cloud. So our ability to deliver on-premise private cloud and public cloud is very important. The ability for us to offer value-added Azure services to people who primarily buy Windows Servers is very important. The possibility to help a customer build a transactional application on SQL Server and yet do the business intelligence in the cloud is very important. And you can go on and on and on not just in people who want one or the other, but in the complement in those scenarios. And our ability to sell those and get them sold in now, because frankly competition is not very active in the game. Amazon is all about the public cloud and has really no on-premise solution. Google is relatively quiet outside of productivity. Even though they have solutions they are relatively quiet. And frankly we have been handing it to them pretty resoundingly in bigger accounts, Office 365. Kevin talked about how well we have been doing. Even I am impressed, and I am not easily impressed. Losing one account is losing too many and yet we don\u2019t lose too many.\nAnd then if you take a look at VMware and Oracle, they are playing primarily with on-premise solutions and not with public cloud solutions. So somehow magically there is this enormous opportunity for us to be the unique player who can bridge this world of the public and private cloud. And you know if you take a look, one of my favorite acquisitions we did was this company called StorSimple. It provides cloud-based storage solutions that we can provide, if you will, in conjunction with Windows Servers or Linux servers frankly that are on-premise. And that thing has really exploded for us and it helps our customers really understand why to double down on us as a hybrid cloud vendor. I heard the questions that came up and I addressed them briefly about non-Microsoft platforms. Those all do represent upside to us. So we don\u2019t have our heads in the sand. We are working away on all the things you think we should be working away on.\nThe most important things first to have is communications and notes. They have to be on every platform and we have done that. Doing authoring correctly on other guys\u2019 platforms without a keyboard and a mouse, it\u2019s tough enough to do it on a Surface where we do have a keyboard and a mouse in a tablet infrastructure. We are investing in building those things in an absolutely first grade way. It\u2019s not clear to me what kind of opportunity financially our competitors are going to allow us to have providing e-mail on their platforms. But even that is interesting to me. It\u2019s interesting to me, although both Google and Apple do a pretty good job of kind of clamping down on the default e-mail experience in their two platforms. So we are building the things that you would have us build. We have surprisingly less religion than you would think we probably have. But we do know the following things are true. We can lead with our enterprise services, but our customers will require us to support other platforms and we are doing so or we can lead with our devices, particularly in the consumer market, and even so if we want people to adopt our services there is a requirement that we support some other platforms.\nWe are always Windows lovers. We love Windows. Windows is first, Windows can be best, because we have the capability of doing so, but we are also eyes wide open and being I think pretty smart in taking a look in developing for other platforms. The next question you can get to is how well will we execute them? The reorganization that we did was more than just let\u2019s move some people around. It really was a fundamental shift from running a set of separate business units, where we tried to make connection points to running a company that is essentially one integrated entity. Now for those who wish that some of the units would go away that probably doesn\u2019t sound very good, but for those of you who really want us to get more agile, more focused and in a sense simplify, it really forces that.\nThe old world we could dream about doing thousands of things in a very small way. In the new world, because we have to get marketing, sales, everything aligned across the company. What I would probably tell you is we can do fewer things than we could have dreamed about in the old world, but we should be able to do them more successfully by training everybody in the organization on those things. I don\u2019t want to create some expectation that there is some major thing that\u2019s going away, a) that\u2019s not true and b) that will be for somebody else to work on here in the not too distant future. But I do tell you that I think one of the grand opportunities now is to take the big things that we talk with you about all the time, the things that Amy is going to highlight in these KPIs that we talked about and really stay very focused, simple and agile against those targets.\nI also want to tell you we have incredible talent. This is something I actually think I understand probably better than almost anybody on the planet. We work with almost everybody in the technology industry. The people we don\u2019t work with because we compete with them guess what we are out recruiting the people everyday. So we know the mid level talent at all of our competitors. We are competing for university talent with all of our competitors. And I will take our team just hands down versus anybody in the business. It doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t some other good teams out there, but we have a phenomenal team starting with the leadership team. You know, about three years ago, I think it was the first time I put in my personnel review with the board that I actually was thinking about the day I might not work at Microsoft. And I agreed with the board that I would spend some time getting to know all of the top people at our competitors, if I could, so that we would have some knowledge base. Whenever I was to decide to retire, we\u2019d kind of know the people from outside Microsoft who might be candidates.\nNow, right now we are in a board succession process, but I have spent three years getting to know a bunch of people. I know senior leaders at all of our competitors at this stage. I have spent time talking to them, interviewing them, getting to know them, talking about Microsoft. And there is a lot of good talent out there, but when I come home I would tell you there is just an incredible group of talent at Microsoft that is competitive with everybody else in the industry, full stop period. The third aspect I would say of execution really will be the new CEO and that does matter. At least I believe that matters so deeply and heavily as the current CEO. And I know our board is in the process of going through a thorough process to evaluate candidates from within and outside of Microsoft to be open-minded.\nWe made this decision to announce before we had a replacement, so we could run the absolute best succession process on the planet. I have got to say it\u2019s kind of a little weird for me to come to work and have that kind of known and yet when we talked it all through, we said this is absolutely the best way to ensure that the company gets the leader that it deserves for this incredibly talented team, whether it\u2019s one of our people who works here or somebody from outside, we wanted to make sure to be able to do that incredibly thoughtfully. Great opportunities, a clear business model, a team and an organization structure that I think will still need to be improved but can get us there. But the other thing I want you to understand just before I move to wrap up is how uniquely poised I think Microsoft is to drive the next big thing.\nNow, what is the next big thing? Well, it\u2019s the next big thing. And you would say, well, tell us Steve what is the next big thing? And of course, there aren\u2019t that many next big things. I mean, I know people say our industry changes all the time and (indiscernible) and something is always flipping. But if you look at it in a Microsoft context, Bill Gates and Paul Allen recognized that software and microprocessors went well together. We bet and succeeded on graphical user interface. We got serious about Intel architecture in the datacenter in about \u201888. And today, people say we are an enterprise company after about 15 years of saying we would never get it right in the enterprise. And almost all the value in our company was created essentially on those three insights. Even if you look at our competitors, most of the wealth and value were created on one or two key insights, getting search right first, really understanding the power of small form factors and low power processors, really understanding the value of an enterprise relationship, getting databases figured out before anybody was there. Each company in our industry probably has one or two or three really big things.\nBut I think that the next big thing that will create value in this industry will probably require companies that have certain capabilities. They will have to understand natural user interface and hardware. Hardware and software will need to kind of evolve together, somebody whether it\u2019s wearables or what\u2019s going on with screen or input technology without the right hardware and software skills, without the right machine learning and cloud infrastructure, without the right focus on applications and platforms, without the right appreciation of consumer and enterprise, I think it\u2019s hard to do. And when you write down the list of companies that have the capabilities that I listed, you would certainly put Microsoft, you probably put Google. We all have certain different strengths. And then after that you might say, hey, Apple is there in many dimensions, but they don\u2019t have the investment in cloud infrastructure, they don\u2019t have the investment in machine learning, and then it just starts to slide from there.\nSo with Microsoft, not only do you get what I would say is incredible short-term upside albeit with some managed and kind of focused areas of risk, but you also get a company that has unique capabilities to shoot the moon if you will for the thing that would really create something that might generate $30 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion of new economic value, which at the end of the day when you invest in a company with enterprise value of $200 billion plus, those are the kind of opportunities that have to look interesting and attractive to you. So we talked about creating a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses that empower people around the globe, at home, at work and on the go for the activities they value most. How we get there, how we create that economic value in the short run is clear. In the long run we have the tools. I tell our people that we are like folks who like athletes who have been in the weight room. We have been training. We are skilled. We are ready. And we have people thinking and coming to work every day saying what is that thing. And it may not happen next year, it may be 2 years, 4 years, 6 years from now. In the meantime, there is great economic upside here. And in the long run we are almost uniquely or just a couple of us poised to seize the opportunity.\nI am along Microsoft. Now I am going to switch. I won\u2019t talk as CEO anymore. I am going to talk now really as an investor, because after I retire I am just a guy who owns 4% of Microsoft. And that\u2019s about 65%, 70% of what I have ever owned. I think I have sold 5 times in my life and I bought once, and I hold on and I treasure my Microsoft stock. And I have treasured it. I know some of you wonder if I treasure it like one of these crazy founders who can\u2019t let go, blah, blah-blah, blah-blah. No, I actually treasure it as an investor, too. I am a believer in Microsoft. I am a believer in the company. I am a believer in what we can do. I don\u2019t normally give you the sales pitch, right. It\u2019s been my tradition to try to highlight risk factors and (indiscernible). Not today. Today, I am speaking as an \u2013 all of you, get up. You all own Microsoft stock. Cheer for it, for God\u2019s sake. We all want it to go the same direction, up.\nAlright, and certainly I am very long. I am \u2013 no, that\u2019s not true \u2013 70% of what I own is in Microsoft. 70% of all the Microsoft I have ever had, I own. And I believe in everything we are telling you here. And we will bring in a new CEO, and that new CEO will have opinions and ideas and thoughts. And my greatest desire will be to see the company be so much more successful 4 years or 5 years from now than it is today. And that will be grounded in three things. Number one, we\u2019ve picked a great new CEO. Number two, we made fundamental bets before that new CEO came out. The strategies that we put in place, the approach that I have put in place that the Board has endorsed those things are important. The new CEO is important. And the leadership team and the talent pool that is here is very important.\nWe have financial strength. That is an asset. The ability to invest, to get into new areas, to think about the next big thing, none of you should take that casually as an investor. I am not making any specific comment about buying back some dividends and (indiscernible), but the fact that we have the financial strength and the wherewithal to really consider the things that will create fundamental new large economic value, that\u2019s a reason why you should want to own the stock, and you should never want to see that go away. We should always manage our downside risks and we should always make sure we have huge upside opportunity.\nAnd for all of those reasons I am very long on Microsoft. I believe in the company as an investment. I believe in what the company can do. I believe in the people and talent that are here. And at least this one shareholder will absolutely be cheering every day, from the day I am not working here on. I am MSFT, if you will, all over. It\u2019s in my blood, it\u2019s in my heart, and I will have been glad to have served. Thank you all very much, and we\u2019ll go to a panel discussion.\nChris Suh - General Manager, Investor Relations\nWe\u2019ll go ahead and move to our Q&A session much like earlier in the day. Our members of IR team are going to be out here with paddles. If you have a question please raise your hand and one of the team will come over and with the mic and then we\u2019ll get started so with that it looks like we are setup so let\u2019s go ahead and get started. Okay let\u2019s start here in the middle paddle two please.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nUnidentified Analyst\nJust a real quick technical question for Amy.\nAmy Hood\nYeah.\nUnidentified Analyst\nThe $6.5 billion of CapEx that you highlighted for fiscal \u201814, obviously a big step up from previous years, is that a one-time step up and then back down, or is that a sustainable level for the next several years?\nAmy Hood\nWell, what I would say is that if you are in the devices and services business and you are successful, I would hope that we continue to need to invest capital to build out the infrastructure and the server capacity over time. So that\u2019s how I would think about it.\nSteve Ballmer\nYes, I mean I don\u2019t know what really happens in all the telecom companies, but at least the myth of the telecom companies from 20 years ago, we should make the investment, huge CapEx, and then it all goes away. Success as Amy said breeds new CapEx here. There is no sort of point of saturation if our customers continue to buy more stuff from us. We would consider that a first rate problem.\nChris Suh\nOkay, let\u2019s go to the back paddle three, please.\nKeith Weiss - Morgan Stanley\nThis is Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Thank you guys for hosting the Analyst Day and very useful information. Steve, you walked through four clear priorities that you guys are going to be focusing on. Can you give us some benchmarks to how we should look at success against those clear priorities? What would be success in Office 365, Azure, Windows PC, mobile devices, and those high-value activities?\nSteve Ballmer\nI\u2019m going to let Amy actually answer. Kevin and I know what the answer is, because we have got that born baby. We know and we\u2019ve kind of pumped up the troops on it, but I can\u2019t remember what we said externally. So I am going to let Amy maybe handle the question. Was that a setup?\nAmy Hood\nThat is something. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll use as a word for it. I would say it this way. Kevin has set very clear targets on those four goals for the field this year to execute on.\nKevin Turner\nAnd next year.\nAmy Hood\nAnd next year for \u201814 and \u201815, I would say if you went out into the field and asked the 40,000 people who work for Kevin what those four things are, they would all know them. And they would all be able to say what their role is in making that successful. They are quantitative, they are comped on them, and that\u2019s the best answer I have to say that we are clear about what they are, and that we are putting our money and comp where Steve\u2019s mouth was.\nSteve Ballmer\nBillions and billions would be the answer to the first, I would say. We have clear targets of what we want to do on 365 and Azure and in a sense cloud revenue cries out like a beckon in the night on the scorecard for our sellers. Hundreds of millions of mobile devices would cry out, and we know we\u2019ve got our work cut out to get there. But that\u2019s the way our field would be thinking, and we\u2019ve had \u2013 our field and our headquarters staff. PCs, we know we want to arrest and then grow in new form factors like two-in-ones and tablets, which means we love to stay north of the 300 million line, but we\u2019re going to have to work hard to get there.\nAnd the way actually we talk about high value activities or we have with our field is selling new workloads. I would say when Kevin started this 7 year or 8 years ago, there were always products on people\u2019s scorecards, and they would say, this product is too small. Why do you put it on our scorecard? And Kevin said, because it\u2019s our future. And so it was the emphasis, when was that probably 5 years ago, 6 years ago, you first put Lync on the scorecard, or we first put on Azure in the scorecard a few years back. Building kind of field experience with those high value workloads with the enterprise, and marketing those high value workloads in our advertising, etcetera, we need to do those well before necessarily they are generating a lot of revenue and profit.\nKevin Turner\nAbsolutely.\nChris Suh\nI see paddle number two in the back.\nKirk Materne - Evercore\nThanks very much. Kirk Materne with Evercore, Amy just along the new disclosures, are we going to also get unearned revenue for some of those buckets so that we can monitor sort of the bookings process as it were for certain of the businesses that are transitioning from license to more of a subscription model?\nAmy Hood\nYes, you should expect to get \u2013 that will be. You happened to ask a specific one on unearned. That will be on the list of KPIs that we walk everybody through next week, but that\u2019s a good one and you should expect to see it.\nKirk Materne - Evercore\n(indiscernible) one for Steve. There is the perception that you need different types of skill sets to operate both in enterprise and the consumer business. I guess as you see this leadership transition coming in, I guess do you feel that internally you have the skill sets to manage both a very large enterprise company as well as a very large consumer company, and does \u2013 I guess how does that impact I guess your view or the board\u2019s view of who makes sense to take over for you? Thanks.\nSteve Ballmer\nYes. I mean this is one people like to jawbone about and I don\u2019t quite get it. We have been selling to consumers and enterprises basically since about 1985. And it used to be people thought we were better at the consumer side and worse at the enterprise side. Now, people think we are better at the enterprise side and worse on the consumer side. I\u2019d love everybody to say you are good at both sides, but I don\u2019t see the fundamental \u2013 I really honestly don\u2019t feel it even in the culture of the place. People were asking questions of the panelists. Well, Terry moved from Exchange as much an enterprise product as we had to Windows Phone, which is much a consumer product as we have and yet skills and talents transfer very well. Somebody said well, Qi is just a consumer guy. Qi has run datacenters at scale that no one else on the planet has ever seen. No CIO has ever seen. His deep expertise in the backend, I would say, that\u2019s probably most of his dialogue he and Kevin grew up having in the company was kind of about datacenter operations and that kind of thing.\nThere is so much shared technology. This is the thing that people miss. Machine learning technology, operating system, cloud infrastructure, all of the things I highlighted, they are so shared. Then the question is can you bring those alive for both the consumer and the enterprise? And we think we have and we think we can. I would note that if you take a look at it, Google thinks they can. I would tell you Amazon thinks they can. So there are certainly a number of companies out there that want to absolutely recognize this consumerization of IT world and play on both sides. We grew up that way. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a sort of big deal, if you will, I just don\u2019t. Even Satya sort of grew up on the consumer side of the business and then moved to the enterprise, because he has been working on server and tools for a few years he gets pegged, but he worked on Bing before that and Dynamics before that.\nIn terms of what any of that means to the succession process, our board is open that they are running a succession process and isn\u2019t going to say anything about kind of factors in thinking. When there is something to say you will hear it, you will hear it from our full board, not from me. I do think that whoever you put in this seat, my seat, will have some things they are stronger on and some things they are less strong on. That\u2019s just kind of inevitable. And the key will be for the board to evaluate who it thinks can be most effective. And I am sure when there is something to report you will hear it.\nChris Suh\nOkay. Let\u2019s go to the front here in paddle one please.\nBrent Thill - UBS\nHi. It\u2019s Brent Thill with UBS. Amy, on your new reporting structure, do you envision giving more simplified targets to the street? I think we have all been a little frustrated with so many different metrics. Is there going to be a clear mile marker that we can look at in this new structure as you look out and forecast this transition?\nAmy Hood\nYes, I am hopeful that I can provide more insight with some clarity on the outlook. I recognize that sometimes our methods of providing guidance or outlook in the past, has been a teeny bit hard to work through. So I recognize the feedback. And I think we will work hard on that. And I appreciate your input. I will give it a good shot in Q1 and then you guys can give me feedback if it got better.\nChris Suh\nThat\u2019s great. Okay, how about we go with number three over there in the back.\nEmily Chan - Sanford Bernstein\nHi. This is Emily Chan from Sanford Bernstein up here. Mark unfortunately is unable to come here today. The question is on the cloud, you talk a lot about the revenue upside and the transition. So how should investors monitor the growth of the cloud business and the transition going forward, any data and any metric that you will provide on an ongoing basis? Thanks.\nKevin Turner\nI think it starts with her reporting. I think that if you looked at the other buckets most of those are cloud services both consumer and commercial. So I think the clarity and granularity you are going to have from a precision standpoint around those services is going to be incredibly richer than you have had before. So I think it starts there.\nAmy Hood\nYes, I think the title of other is not incredibly helpful to realize what\u2019s in that bucket is more important. That\u2019s really more of an issue from a reporting standpoint. But those really are, our enterprise services will be in the other bucket and a lot of our consumer services are in the other devices and consumer bucket. And I think you will really be able to see the progress we are making on both units, revenue and gross margin in terms of COGS efficiencies.\nChris Suh\nOkay, how about going back to number four please.\nJason Maynard - Wells Fargo\nHey, Steve, it\u2019s Jason Maynard, Wells Fargo back here. So I am totally with you, consumer, enterprise, we are all people we use technology both cases, no argument there. But the thing that I am struggling with is it\u2019s harder to make money selling hardware. It\u2019s harder to make money selling software and licensing in a mobile world, and there is this shift obviously to generating, if you will, revenue around cloud services and data for consumers. And the thing that I see is when you vertically integrate your cloud services to your devices right it\u2019s a similar model that you employed in the PC era where you are successful in bundling Office and Windows, right, and it made an amazing use case.\nBut guys like me and I think a lot of people we have got multiple devices, and however, you cut it I don\u2019t see how Windows devices defined as PCs, smartphones, tablets are going to have enough share for me to reap the benefit as a user of all your great cloud services. I mean I am going to have some iOS, I am going to have some Android, and it\u2019s just too much of a heterogeneous device world for the devices and services strategy to have the same impact generating the revenue. So I am one of the guys who keep arguing you have got to let your apps free and just run cross-platform and if you log me in, not lock me in, maybe I will buy a Lumia device at one point.\nSteve Ballmer\nYes. You said something that was exactly the opposite of what I said. So I will say it again, well I mean this respectfully actually, you said you are going to bundle your cloud services with your devices. Let me say what I said, yes, our devices should come with our cloud services. The reverse, I fairly deliberately said is not the case. You will be able to use our services without our devices, but our devices will absolutely honor and respect our services. Now I know we can do a better job on our own devices, because we can also worry about real integration, which is harder to do with the kind of closed nature of the Android, the Google Play Store and the Apple Store. But just put that aside, the truth of the matter is our devices carry our services, and our services will be available on a number of people\u2019s devices.\nI am going to say it a third time, I tried to say it in my speech I have said it here. And I think the order is important. A device is \u2013 particularly to the consumer \u2013 particularly to the consumer, consumers just don\u2019t spend the lot of money after the device and the subscription with the operator. Consumers never did. If you look at our Office business today, our Office business is 15% maybe from the consumer 20%. So maybe 20% of our Office business kind of looking back into a licensing world, maybe 15% to 20% came from the consumer, despite the fact that the consumer buys 67% of the systems. So it\u2019s always been smaller. What we are telling you is we are going to integrate our services with our devices. We will also make our services available on other people\u2019s devices, both to the consumer and to the enterprise. SkyDrive, OneNote, now how do we get our services to be popular on non-Windows devices.\nWith the enterprise, we kind of know how to do that. You walk into the enterprise, you say sign up for Office 365, you say we are going to embrace your iPads and your iPhones, and (indiscernible), we know how to do that. We know how to get paid. Life feels pretty straightforward. We will manage those things for you. Satya and Kevin both talked about managing those devices. With the consumer, it\u2019s a lot trickier to have a high popularity service with the consumer. Our highest kind of highest visibility consumer service right now is probably Skype. And one of the key reasons, in fact, that we bought Skype was to have a high volume visible consumer service, we probably need \u2013 and its cross platform as could be and we probably should use it to capture more functionality. And I will remind you Apple kind of has rules in their stores. You can\u2019t have suites. They know they have to avoid people getting too much traction with their services on their devices, but we are working away on it and it\u2019s very, very important to us. So let me say am I in a different spot than you? If so the answer is marginally a different spot. Devices come with services. Services have to find their way on to non-Microsoft devices and we certainly have to support that without religious bias if you will.\nChris Suh\nOkay, thanks so much. Okay, we are going to come up here to the front and go to paddle two please.\nKen Copley - Capital Executive\nHi. This is Ken Copley with Capital Executive. I realized this might be an off-the-wall question, but at a time when Microsoft was even more dominant in the market than it is today, Google strategically made a decision to attack you guys by giving away the operating system calling it open source, and anyway you cut it it\u2019s been successful. They have garnered about what 79% of the market. And right now they are generating about 83% of their businesses in search related advertising or search related services. It\u2019s a highly concentrated revenue stream. And I think when you get a highly concentrated revenue stream that creates a weakness or a vulnerability so to speak. And I am just wondering if you can talk about any kind of strategies that might be in play where you might take advantage of or attack that vulnerability within Google? Thank you.\nSteve Ballmer\nWell, first of all, we are the only guys in the world trying, and that starts with a great product. We have invested in Bing particularly in the United States some of the new investment in Bing is to make it as good outside the United States as it is in the United States, and that requires more investment because you have to index more of the web. You have to know about more about local events and information, etcetera. So number one, you got to get the product right. Number two, you sort of have to be at critical mass. This is a scale game, because the market for advertising is auction-based economics. So if we have exactly the same quality of algorithms, but a lot less scale in search advertising, we will get less revenue per search than Google does which means they have more money to pay for distribution on Samsung devices or Apple. Rumor has it that they probably pay each of those guys $1 billion to $2 billion to $3 billion a year for distributing their search product. So we have to generate volume in order to step up.\nI do believe that Google\u2019s practices are worthy of discussion with competition authority, and we have certainly discussed them with competition authorities. I don\u2019t think their practices are getting less meritorious of discussion. We have highlighted some of their bad practices in our advertising, in our discussions with regulators, the bundling that they are doing with YouTube and Google Maps and some other things. Anyway, suffice it to say that I think they need pressure from competition authority. I think they need pressure in the marketplace. I think with product, with investment, with scale. How do we get scale? The easiest place for us to get scale is on our own devices or on somebody with whom we are closely aligned. We are very pleased to be providing Bing results as part of the Siri offer now with Apple. And you might say well, that\u2019s unusual, but we have made an investment that Apple hasn\u2019t. We found a way to partner with them and we are excited about that in this dimension. So there is a range of things that we are doing. And I do believe that\u2019s an important pressure point. That advertising marketplace right now, Google has pretty well defensed. But I think we have got a pretty good attack strategy. It will take a little bit more time and a little bit more patience. I think it will have great economic return for our shareholders and at the same time changes a lot of the competitive dynamics overall between our companies.\nKevin Turner\nThe one thing I would amplify there on the compete strategy was the search charms that we have got in 8.1 are certainly an accelerator to Bing as well. So Qi touched on that when he was up here that is we see a game changer both from a usability perspective and a search perspective in that particular piece of technology.\nSteve Ballmer\nYes, just \u2013 let me just build on what Kevin said, with Windows Phone, I know we have small market share in phones. I am not confused, but we have a high share of searches on Windows Phones. And it is a reminder, just take a look at the share Apple has of maps on their own phones and I know they had all the celebrated hullabaloo but if I remember the numbers correctly, about 65% of the map usage today on iPhones is Apple Maps. So in a sense, probably one of the best ways to get some share in search is to get some share in devices. Google happens to say let\u2019s not have any profit be in the device. Let\u2019s move it all into search. We and Apple kind of have a different view of the world. Amazon, I don\u2019t know where they want to put market profit. They don\u2019t seem to put the profit anywhere and that\u2019s not a shot. It\u2019s just I can\u2019t tell you what profit stream is important to them the way we can about us or Apple or Google. So we see what Google is trying to do between combined economics between consumer services and devices. And part of the reason why the segment we are reporting is devices and consumer services is because we don\u2019t want just sitting there saying well, jeez, Microsoft decided to monetize through search or advertising as opposed to through device gross margin or royalty and think that there is something wrong. We constructed it as a segment precisely, because we do see the same competitive dynamics, and we see the same technology opportunities that Kevin referenced.\nChris Suh\nOkay, let\u2019s go with number three please.\nRoss Macmillan - Jefferies\nThanks. It\u2019s Ross Macmillan from Jeffries. You made a commitment with Azure to match Amazon for compute, storage and bandwidth prices, and Amazon has a strategy of running their business at retail margins, very low single digit margins. So as Azure grows how should we think about that margin structure? Is there a reason why your margins might be different from a low single-digit retail margin? And then second, do you envisage Azure workloads as being complementary to all the server and tools on premise business or do you think ultimately it will be somewhat cannibalistic and it will take over some of those on-premise workloads? Thanks.\nKevin Turner\nOn your first question, I think look the infrastructure as a service economics are some of the lowest margin in the cloud. And clearly, Amazon has been tough. And we have been in there matching and competing with them. But if you remember back when we started Azure, we didn\u2019t start with infrastructure as a service. We started with platform as a service. In the platform as a service, which we I believe have leading technology, leading-edge technology versus any competitor including Amazon in that space, that\u2019s where we see the ability to really take advantage of what we call modern IT when people really rewrite their applications for the cloud to be able to leverage a pay as you go service to be able to really light up a full cloud service. In an enterprise, the margin structures on the platform as a service are much more favorable than they are as an infrastructure as a service. So our on-ramp would be to on-ramp people to infrastructure as a service and upgrade them, up-sell them as they reinvent their IT departments and hopefully we are facilitating that in the platform as a service world. As it relates to the \u2013 go ahead\u2026.\nSteve Ballmer\nNo go ahead.\nKevin Turner\nAs it relates to the cannibalization question, as we move people from on-premise to cloud, yes, we are willing to cannibalize ourselves to do it, and we have embraced that. And when I said that transition is underway, it\u2019s underway. And this wasn\u2019t an FY \u201813; we have been working on this for a while. Steve talked about how we bootstrap new products. We have had the Office 365 formerly a not so sexy name of BPOS, on our store dashboard and store card for a while. And we have been driving that volume. It\u2019s finally hitting scale, but we put in a few years there of good toilage and work to be able to get it there. And I think the cannibalization stuff is imminent. There will always be some on-premise out there, but the reality is we want as many of those customers as we can get in the cloud all-in, because number one I can keep them current. And I can get them up to the latest and greatest level without them having to worry about it, because as I have said before publicly, I think one of our big liabilities in the old world was the amount of products that people owned of ours that they didn\u2019t have deployed. In this new world they are deployed, because we are deploying it for them.\nThe second reason I believe that, that cloud accelerant is going to continue is we can keep them more safe and secure than they can. And everybody has come to the realization of that in Cybersecurity and all of the issues that go along there I think was only going to continue to accelerate. So yes, we have embraced the cannibalization of the cloud and welcome it, because the long-term revenue stream and value for those customers is much different than anything we have had in the past.\nSteve Ballmer\nJust a reminder, we are not new to the world of commoditization. There were kind of Linux servers in the old world. And we competed against them. And there are \u2013 there is always going to be something that looks like a commodity that is low margin, or in the old world people just used free software. So the key is, again, this notion of high value activities. If we can support something that is of great value, believe me, IT people, saving their company money is important, sleeping well at night, because of security, reliability, availability, speed and agility of deployment, there are a lot of places to change what looks like a commodity game right now for storage. And you may not do it for a Silicon Valley start-up. They are going to sit there and get the fine pencil out. But the average enterprise is looking at a total cost of ownership, just like in the old days when they were looking at free Office, and free Windows. I think there is a chance to, again, have a value proposition that is better and lower total cost of ownership even if on some specific item the commoditized workload might look cheaper from either Amazon or Microsoft.\nChris Suh\nThat\u2019s great. Okay. Let\u2019s stay here in the front, paddle 1 please.\nRick Sherlund - Nomura\nThanks. Rick Sherlund. Steve, I thought you were pretty explicit that there is a version of Office 365 optimized for touch coming for other platforms. So congratulations on that. I think that will be a big step in delivering on your strategy.\nSteve Ballmer\nAnd Windows platforms.\nRick Sherlund - Nomura\nYes, touch is a different interface, a different version I am sure. So could you update us perhaps on where you stand in terms of the restructuring, has this already taken place, is it going to take a number of quarters for everyone to know kind of what their structure is, who they are reporting to, and to make all those changes, if you can sort of update us on the status there. And maybe for Amy, I am a little confused about how big the cloud is for Microsoft. We have got a piece here, a piece there. Is there a number you can give us that gives us an idea of how big your actual cloud business is today in aggregate?\nSteve Ballmer\nYes, on structure, of course the first thing to do is the first layer and then the second layer and then the third layer and things kind of progress. The first layer is obviously done. There is not a lot of change in Kevin\u2019s world at the next layer. Tami is mostly done. Tony Bates, who runs our business development and evangelism is mostly done I would say, on the business side. On the R&D side, Terry made some moves. He probably has a few more over time as his guys figure it out. But he has put in the structure below him. Satya has perhaps fewer changes that he will make. Obviously with the acquisition of Nokia there will be a set of work that needs to go on that Julie will work on with Stephen Elop, who will run that area. Kirill\u2019s group, because of the kind of special nature in that very profitable business that\u2019s called Dynamics, we are mostly kind of leaving things as is and just matrixing in the marketing and some of the other functions. That\u2019s working.\nAnd Qi, Qi is taking some time. There is nothing to report. He is sort of developing his unified thesis of what to do in order to get kind of the max productivity, the most high value kind of \u2013 the most application \u2013 effective application development out of his team, and taking into account what we are trying to do. So when there is news there will be news, but he has not done anything at the layer underneath him. His structure looks exactly like it looked before the re-org, and it could stay that way or he could choose to change it. None of anything I said has financial ramifications. I am just talking to you about where things are. And Amy\u2019s already given guidance separately and maybe I will let you finish the question.\nAmy Hood\nI think, Rick, you asked me to give a cloud revenue number. Why don\u2019t I take that as guidance on what you\u2019d like to hear from me as a KPI, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019d probably give one off the top of my head. It\u2019s probably not the best way of doing it. So let me take that as a KPI input.\nChris Suh\nI think we have time for one more question actually. So let\u2019s see, the winner is paddle one.\nUnidentified Analyst\n(Indiscernible) ambitious and make big, bold bets with big economic upside. And that\u2019s increasingly rare in IT. Frankly, you have been consistent in that over many years. So the question is, why do you think financial markets haven\u2019t recognized that and does that make you do anything differently?\nSteve Ballmer\nFinancial markets should recognize it when it leads to profit growth. So what I basically said is I have a thesis. The company needs to produce every day, and we have got upsides and we have got a little headwind. Kevin and I both talked about it. But we\u2019ve got plenty upside. In the meantime, we will continue to sustain investment in the technology, the talent, the approach that gives us the skills to seize on the next opportunity. If there is one thing I guess you would say I regret, I regret that there was a period in the early 2000s when we were so focused on what we had to do around Windows, that we weren\u2019t able to redeploy talent to the new device form factor called the phone. That would probably the thing I would tell you I regret the most, because the time we missed was about the time we were working away on what became Vista, and I wish we probably had our resources slightly differently deployed, let me say, during the early 2000s. It would have been better for Windows and probably better for our success in other form factors.\nSo should the market just believe? I can\u2019t argue that. What I can say is the ultimate measure of the place has got to be what happens with profits. It\u2019s got to be the ultimate measure of any company. On that dimension we\u2019ve made bets, the bets have worked, and we are making new bets. And when they work I am sure people will give us credit, whether those are incremental upsides to our current profit pool with some exposures on the downside but incremental upsides, or whether that\u2019s really the next big thing.\nApple was what essentially zero market cap in 1997? And now its enterprise value is close to \u2013 and I\u2019ll use enterprise value because that\u2019s kind of how I think. Enterprise value is close to $300 billion. That\u2019s $300 billion a new market cap created on touch and microprocessors. And it happened to be created in that case is through a devices approach. But at the end of the day, if we are not investing in those new opportunities, then it is assured that we have no opportunity for that growth. So I think you should hold us accountable, and I certainly as a shareholder will hold us accountable for continuing to focus in on good short-term results, and at the same time making investments that give us an opportunity to generate someday another $10 billion, $15 billion, $20 billion, $25 billion of incremental profit, which would be great to be able to dream about and certainly a few companies have created those kinds of profit pools in the last 10 years, 15 years.\nChris Suh - General Manager, Investor Relations\nThat\u2019s great. Thank you. With that, that concludes our Financial Analyst Meeting for today. Thank you all for joining us today, taking the time to come out. We do hope that you stick around for the reception. We\u2019re going to move next door and many of our executives and presenters will stick around and you\u2019ll have a chance for some in formal conversation. Again thank you. For those that have already submitted the survey, thank you again. Well, we\u2019ll pick the winner and we will announce them next week. And we look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.\n\n",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Nate Gilch, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nNate Gilch\nThank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2016 financial results. On today's call will be Ed Stack, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Andr\u00e9 Hawaux, our Chief Operating Officer and Lee Belitsky, our Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note that a rebroadcast of today's call will be archived on the Investor Relations portion of our website, located at dicks.com, for approximately 30 days. In addition, as outlined in our press release, the dial-in replay will also be available for approximately 30 days.\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events.

Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. We have also included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion today. Our presentation of the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and related reconciliations can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at dicks.com\nNow I will turn the call over to Ed Stack.\nEdward Stack\nThanks, Nate. I\u2019d like to thank all of you for joining us today. But before I begin, I\u2019d like to take a moment to introduce Lee Belitsky our new Chief Financial Officer. Lee\u2019s appointment comes following an already distinguished career at DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods that spans nearly 20 years. In that time, he has held a number of leadership positions, such as VP Controller and Treasurer, Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Treasury Services, Senior Vice President of Store Operations and Supply Chain and most recently the Executive Vice President of Product Development, Merchandised Planning Allocation and Replinishment. \nLee\u2019s strong financial acumen and extensive leadership experience will be instrumental to the continued growth and success of DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods.\nLee Belitsky\nThank you, Ed and thanks for the kind words. It\u2019s great to be here this morning and I\u2019m looking forward to working with all of you.\nEdward Stack\nThanks, Lee. We had a strong third quarter and delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.48, consolidated comp store sales of 5.2% both exceeding the high end of our guidance range.\nOur eCommerce sales increased 33% and grew to 9.6% of sales compared to 8% in the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we realized meaningful market share gains and saw a growth across each of our three primary categories, hardlines, apparel and footwear. Both our Outdoor and Golf businesses comped positively.\nFootwear was strong and we remain encouraged with the results of our premium full service footwear decks. Growth in apparel was driven by license which benefitted from the favorable teams in the Major League Baseball Play-offs.\nThis growth was partially offset by declines in some cold weather categories. We continue to drive differentiation through our strong private brand portfolio and we are very pleased with the performance of key brands such as CALIA, and Field & Stream.\nLooking ahead, we expect private brand annual sales to reach over $1 billion in the next few years and have multiple new launches planned in 2017. Now let me provide a few updates and how we remain focused on driving profitable growth in care free market share.\nOn the marketing front, our recent Olympic campaign and contenders program was a great success, garnering over 600 million media impressions and generating significant brand awareness. Building on this momentum we announced the extension of our team USA partnership and in-store employment program through the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea.\nAdditionally, we are making progress on the recently acquired TSA Customer Information and it will be directly marketed to these customers during this holiday season. In early November, we completed the purchase of Golfsmith\u2019s strongest assets, including intellectual property and lease designation rights.\nThis marks a terrific opportunity for us as we continue to build our position as America\u2019s number one golf retailer and focus on capturing a significant amount of market share as the industry consolidates.\nLooking to next year we expect this acquisition to be accretive to our earnings. Digital is a big priority and this business continues to accelerate. We have made significant investments in our eCommerce business and remain on track to re-launch dicks.com on our own web platform in the first quarter of next year.\nOur eCommerce sales will be just under $1 billion this year and we believe there is meaningful opportunity for future growth. We are also pleased to share an update on DICK\u2019S Team Sports HQ platform which we launched this past January.\nTeam Sports HQ is a suite of digital tools that provide youth sports league and their affiliates with access to free online registration, team websites, custom uniforms and FanWear as well as a mobile app through which teams can schedule and communicate with each other.\nOur aspirations to become the hub of youth sports for kids, parents, coaches and league officials making this platform the authentic resource for all the needs in team sports. As part of this strategy, I am excited to announce that we now have an agreement in principle to become the official league technology provider for Little League baseball and its affiliated organizations. Through this partnership, Little League\u2019s over 2.1 million athletes, coaches and administrators will now have access to DICKS Team Sports HQ services.\nLooking out to the fourth quarter, we are confident that our assortment and marketing will help us to continue to capture this displaced market share this holiday season. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our associates across the company for the hardworking commitment they have showed to deliver these significant third quarter results and for the upcoming efforts in this important holiday season.\nI\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Andre.\nAndre Hawaux\nThank you, Ed. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our growth drivers and expand our powerful Omni-channel platform. We opened 27 new DICK'S Sporting Goods stores and relocated four DICK'S stores. We also opened seven new Field & Stream stores and two new Golf Galaxy stores and closed one Field & Stream store.\nSixteen of the DICK\u2019S stores opened in new markets including Houston, the fourth largest city in the country where we\u2019ve historically had no DICK stores. The Houston grand opening was the largest in the company\u2019s history. We opened ten stores on the same day including two locations that feature DICK\u2019S Field & Stream and Golf Galaxy stores, all housed under the same roof.\nThese unique shopping destinations are the first of their kind and provide the Houston community with unmatched selection and service for all of their sporting goods, outdoor and golf needs.\nLast quarter, we purchased TSA\u2019s intellectual property and the right to acquire 31 store leases. After a thorough review process we have retained 22 of these leases primarily located in California and South Florida. Next week, the first three of these former TSA\u2019s stores will reopen as DICK stores and the majority of the remaining stores are expected to reopen during the first quarter of 2017.\nAs we have discussed one of the ways we are driving store productivity is through our premium full service footwear decks which encompass a best-in-class merchandised presentation, elevated service levels and a broader assortment. At the end of the quarter, we had a 182 premium full service footwear decks and will convert the final two stores in time for the holiday season. The sales results are encouraging and we plan to incorporate these decks in the majority of our new stores next year.\nLastly, as Ed mentioned we recently purchased Golfsmith\u2019s intellectual property and the rights to acquire store leases along with the inventory for thirty stores. The purchase price was approximately $43 million of which $32 million is related to inventory. The intellectual property includes the name Golfsmith as well as domain names owned private brands and importantly customer information.\nThe deal was structured with maximum flexibility where we have the right to retain or reject any or all of the leases. In total, we plan to evaluate approximately 40 leases. These include 30 of Golfsmith\u2019s most profitable locations where we acquired the store inventory. We are currently operating these locations and we plan to convert them to the Golf Galaxy brand by the end of the fourth quarter.\nI\u2019ll now turn the call over to Lee to review our financial performance in greater detail.\nLee Belitsky\nThank you, Andre. Good morning everyone. Beginning with our third quarter financial results, consolidated sales increased 10.2% to approximately $1.8 billion. Consolidated same-store sales, which includes all banners, both online and in-store, increased 5.2% which was above the high end of our guidance.\nWithin this, DICK'S Sporting Goods' of the Omni-channel same-store sales increased 5.5% driven by a 1.3% increase in ticket and a 4.2% increase in traffic. Golf Galaxy omni-channel same-store sales decreased 3.3%. We continued to see strong growth in our eCommerce business which increased 33%.\nGross profit for the third quarter was $553 million or 30.54% of sales up 81 basis point of the last year. Within this increase, merchandize margins expanded and we leveraged our occupancy expenses, partially offset by shipping cost associated with growth of our eCommerce business.\nNon-GAAP SG&A expenses were $453 million for the quarter or 25.04% of sales, an increase of 147 basis points from the same period last year. The deleverage was primarily driven by three items. First, we increased administrative head counts to support our growth initiatives such as our eCommerce platform. Next, we invested in our Olympic marketing campaign and lastly, we continued to invest in payroll to enhance the shopping experience within our stores including premium full-service footwear.\nWe also received a multiyear $2.9 million sales tax refund that favorably impacted other income in the quarter. In total, led by our strong comp store sales performance, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.48 which exceeded the high end of our earnings guidance of $0.42.\nDuring the quarter, we incurred approximately $7.6 million of cost pre tax or $0.04 per diluted share to begin converting former TSA stores to DICK stores. These costs include occupancy expenses and professional fees related to the transition.\nDuring the same period last year, we recorded a litigation settlement charge of $7.9 million pre tax or $0.04 per diluted share. For additional details, you can refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation in the tables of the press release issued this morning.\nNow looking to our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with approximately $85 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $261 million in borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion revolving credit facility.\nTotal inventory increased 4.8% which is well below our 10.2% sales growth in the quarter. We are very comfortable with our inventory levels and the quality of our merchandize as we transition into the holiday selling season.\nTurning to our third quarter capital allocation. Net capital expenditures were $53 million, or $99 million on a gross basis. Additionally, during the quarter, we paid $16.8 million in dividends and repurchased $9 million of stock at an average price of $51.53. Our year-to-date share repurchases totaled $116 million and we have approximately $1.1 billion remaining in our authorizations.\nNow let me wrap up with our outlook for the remainder of the year. As Ed indicated, we believe we have the merchandising and marketing plans in place to drive sales during this important holiday season.\nFor the fourth quarter we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.19 to $1.31 with an increase in consolidated same store sales between 3% and 6%.\nFourth quarter operating margin is expected to increase slightly at the higher end of our comp guidance range and decline towards the lower end of our range. Within this we expect gross margins to increase and SG&A expenses to de-leverage.\nLooking at the full year, we are raising our guidance and now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of between $2.99 and $3.11. This compares to our prior guidance of between $2.90 and $3.05. We now expect consolidated same-store sales to increase between 3% and 4%.\nTo remind everyone, we are investing in three key initiatives in 2016 impacting [Indiscernible] by approximately $50 million to $55 million. First, to transition and grow our eCommerce business, second to build our brand by partnering U.S. Olympic committee and Team USA and third to support to support the rollout of our full-service footwear decks.\nAs a result, higher SG&A expenses with some partial relief from gross profit improvement will cause operating margins to decline year-over-year. Net capital expenditures for the full year of 2016 are now expected to be approximately $275 million or about $450 million on a gross basis.\nPlease note that our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share guidance does not include certain cost which I had previously described to convert former TSA and Golfsmith stores.\nWe will continue to separately report these cost to you in future periods. This will conclude our prepared comments. We appreciate your interest in DICK\u2019s Sporting Goods. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] and your first question will come from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSeth Sigman\nThanks a lot, good morning and really nice quarter guys. I wanted to dig into the guidance a little bit for the fourth quarter and kind of the thought process behind comps up 3% to 6%. You have a pretty easy comparison and I\u2019m sure there is naturally some conservatism just given how big the fourth quarter is, but any considerations maybe weather or something else that we should be watching?\nEdward Stack\nYes. We said, it's primarily around weather and we've had similar weather pattern than we had last year, and we're weather sensitive in the fourth quarter. So, we've got a lot of outwear both ski outerwear, cold weather outerwear, hunting outerwear and we're weather sensitive in the fourth quarter and we're just concerned about what's going to happen from weather standpoint.\nSeth Sigman\nAnd then, to follow-up, as you think about what's embedded for the fourth quarter in terms of margins. Is there an assumption that maybe there is a little bit more discounting or promotional activity to work through any sort of cold weather inventory that maybe out there?\nEdward Stack\nNot really, I mean, we're concerned about what will happen from a cold weather standpoint, but we don't have anything baked in from a more promotional environment. As you saw our inventory increased to have the rate that our sales increased, so we're really \u2013 we're confident in the inventory levels that we have and the quality of the inventory, so, we're not terribly concerned there.\nSeth Sigman\nGot it. Okay. And then just on gross margin in the third quarter, any way to quantify how much of the leverage was occupancy leverage versus merchandize margin improvement?\nLee Belitsky\nMajority of it is in merchandize margin improvement.\nSeth Sigman\nOkay, great. Thanks.\nOperator\nAnd the next question will come from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser\nGood morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. If you look at the stores that were not in areas that directly surrounded at their closings, how those stores comp during the quarter?\nLee Belitsky\nWe don't provide that level of granularity, but \u2013 so we're not going to give you the specifics, but the stores where we are if market share opportunities where sports authority closed. So we are starting to see a little bit of that, where Golfsmith is closing or closed, those stores as you would expect perform better than the stores that had no change in the competitive environment.\nMichael Lasser\nWere they like 2x, 3x or just more marginally better?\nEdward Stack\nWe're not going to provide that level of granularity.\nMichael Lasser\nOkay. And heading into this year, you expected the strategic investments has been building up eComm, the Olympic marketing campaign and labor investment that cost you $50 million or $55 million. If you back that out from your SG&A run rate and what's implied in fourth quarter. You're still going to deleverage SG&A considerably. So, are you just reinvesting a significant amount of the market share back into other parts of business and this how philosophically you want to see the business unfold over the next 12 to 18 months?\nLee Belitsky\nWell, I think that investment will slow as we go into next year, but we've made the number of investments as we said from eCommerce standpoint from what we're doing with the full service DICK'S from the Olympic campaign growing our brand in general, but that growth will slow going into next year.\nMichael Lasser\nDo you expect the flow through to be much better next year than it is this year?\nLee Belitsky\nWell, we've talked about just with the fact of what we'll do from an eCommerce standpoint that we expect the operating margins to increase approximately 30 basis points from what we're doing from an eCommerce standpoint. And we're not going to provide our guidance for 2017 now but you can expect that those margins will increase next year.\nMichael Lasser\nThank you so much.\nLee Belitsky\nSure.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst\nHi, good. This is [Indiscernible] on behalf of Rob. Can you just discuss the trends you're seeing in apparel kind of excluding the license business? Do you think the softness you're seeing there is entirely based on the warmer weather?\nEdward Stack\nWell, we think that the weather has impacted this. We're pretty pleased with what's going on with our apparel business overall. On the athletic side, the cold weather merchandizes have been what we'd hope it would be. We were hoping for a little different weather pattern. But that being said we've been very \u2013 our team has done a great job from an inventory standpoint.\nOur brands have worked great with us and inventory and even if the weather doesn't get cold like we hope it would be, we don't really see that we have anything meaningful from an inventory issues.\nUnidentified Analyst\nSo excluding license this apparel still grew?\nEdward Stack\nWe're pleased with it. Yes, it did.\nUnidentified Analyst\nAnd then what was the traffic and ticket during the quarter?\nLee Belitsky\nLet us get back on that.\nUnidentified Analyst\nAnd just one final question. On the 22 TSA stores are converting to DICK stores, in the context of maybe next year store growth, should we think about those is replacing DICK'S openings or would those be incremental?\nEdward Stack\nWell, there'll be a little bit \u2013 there would be a little bit both. So it's going to be some incremental because when we bought these we'd already had a real estate plan in place. So it's going to be slightly incremental but all of them opening up, it won't be all incremental. We slowed a little bit in the back half for the year and move some of them to 2018.\nLee Belitsky\nAnd ticket was up 1.3% and traffic up 4.2%.\nUnidentified Analyst\nGreat. Thanks so much.\nOperator\nThe next question will be from Michael Baker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker\nThanks. What happens if the weather gets cold, how quickly can you get more merchandize into your stores, because your inventory per foot is down quite a bit, so how does that work with your vendors?\nEdward Stack\nWe've got \u2013 we characterize as partnership orders with the vendors that there is product that if it gets colder and we need it where we see certain style selling that we will release that inventory and it will be into our system. So, if it gets cold we'll be fine from inventory standpoint. If it doesn't get cold we'll still be fine for an inventory standpoint. We've got these partnership orders and the brands have been terrific to work with.\nMichael Baker\nAnd, so I guess follow-up on that, with the competitive situation having evolved as it has, are you seeing more access to partner inventory or those conversations sort of improving in your favor not just for the partner inventory, but just in general with your vendors?\nEdward Stack\nLet's put it this way. They've gotten better. But we've got above this in a year and a true partnership with the brands. They've talked to us about what opportunities they think that we can pick up from TSA. We're starting to have conversations with the golf vendors about what opportunities we might have to be able to pick up with Golfsmith that we may not have been fully aware of. So the partnership and the communication, the collaboration with the brands has been very helpful.\nMichael Baker\nOkay. That's great. Thanks. One more quick follow-up if I could slide in, you've extended the Olympic deal, so any way to quantify what that will cost from your $50 million to $55 million, for this year we were able to sort of estimate the impact to 2016, I thought it would be zero next year, now that its extended, what should we assume in our model?\nEdward Stack\nNot significant. It\u2019s all built into our total marketing budget.\nMichael Baker\nOkay. Appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nStephen Tanal\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to talk for a minute about some of the puts and takes in the comp. And you'd mentioned that there may have been sort of an overhang from the TSA sales heading into back-to-school and cleats and that sort of thing. Do you feel like that actually happened and do you have any different expectations for share gains from TSA in 4Q versus 3Q as a result?\nLee Belitsky\nWell, did some of that happened, yes, it did. It wasn't to the extent that we had anticipated. So, it was better than we had anticipated. Going forward we think there is still meaningful market shared gains to get over the next couple of quarters and our fourth quarter is really, a lot of it is driven by weather, but we think that from TSA again Golfsmith closing as this industry consolidates we're clearly the one of the big winners in this consolidation and we expect that market share -- those market share gains to continue.\nStephen Tanal\nOkay. It's helpful. And just on license, as we try to think about, what the World Series may have done there and that business overall, is there anything you could share obviously best would be an estimate of what you think license did to the comp, but if not that maybe just size up license as a percent of total just help us think about order of magnitude there?\nEdward Stack\nWell, we won't give it you. It's granular as you probably want it. But it was really important to that quarter. And our team did a terrific job all through the pennant races and then leading up to the World Series. The team really did a great job. We reopened stores when the cops and the Indians clenched the pennant and both cities responded, both cities were really excited about their teams been in the playoffs and it was helpful to our business for sure.\nStephen Tanal\nAwesome. And then just last from me, I'd love to understand kind of your initial expectations around the TSA conversions and the Golfsmith stores as well, just as we've modeled those in. Are the TSA sites, the one they reopen under DICK'S likely to look \u2013 like a DICK'S from a sales and profitability perspective? Or should there be some sort of a ramp and same question for the Golfsmith which obviously you're operating today, so you probably better feel for that versus Galaxy?\nAndre Hawaux\nSo, Steve, this is Andre. I'll take the first part of that relative to the TSA that we're going to be opening. Many of those are going into very much under penetrated market for us. So we see actually them performing very, very well, very similar to kind of returns we see in the DICK store.\nThere is slightly smaller not a whole lot smaller, but they'll do very well in those markets. We also expect to see a significant market share pickup from what is happening in the golf space today between what Golf Galaxy will pick up and the market share will pick up as a result of picking up the most attractive leases we see in the Golfsmith portfolio as we go forward.\nStephen Tanal\nGot it. Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator\nThe next question will be from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst\nHey, guys. This is actually [Benjamin] for Simeon. Just a quick question around, I think you express some conservatism about Q3 with respect to inventory in the marketplace. What went better in the quarter? Was it the consumer behave stronger or there was just less overlap. I know you call out 1 million pairs of cleats in terms of inventory; did you see impact at all this quarter?\nEdward Stack\nYes. As I said we thought the impact was less that we had anticipated.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay. Thanks. And just one more on two-year basis gross margins were up 93 basis points this quarter. I know you didn't give explicit gross margin guidance, but playing with assumptions it doesn't appear to be much GM growth despite relatively easy comparisons. Can you help us understand why?\nEdward Stack\nI'm not sure I understand the question.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOn the two-year basis GM was up 93 basis points and I know you didn't gave explicit guidance, but given the significantly easy comparisons last year, I would thought there been some bigger lift, was there anything noteworthy impacting that line this quarter?\nSimeon Gutman\nHey, Ed, it's Simeon I just jump as well. I think we're meeting specifically for the fourth quarter as we looked into it. Again you didn't tell us the breakdown between GM and SG&A, but it looks like it set up on a rolling basis to do better on GM and that's what we're trying to understand if there's any color around that?\nEdward Stack\nYou're talking about the third quarter \u2013 the question was of third quarter?\nSimeon Gutman\nThe third quarter the run rate was good. And we're asking about the fourth quarter?\nEdward Stack\nOkay. Nothing there, we just \u2013 we are so sensitive to from a weather standpoint. The cold weather merchandize is a high margin product and we're not sure. We're hoping it would have gotten colder earlier than it has already.\nLee Belitsky\nAnd just to reiterate on the Q3 operating performance of gross margin, we feel very good. Our March margin was very strong and we leverage occupancy offset by a little bit of an increased shipping expenses as a result of the strong growth we have in our eCommerce business, so we feel very good about what we saw in our Q3 gross margin performance.\nSimeon Gutman\nOkay. And then I just want to lump one more, I apologize if this is asked, but just in terms of the SG&A I think you read in order a couple of headwinds at least in the third quarter. You mentioned administrative expenses Olympic and then store payroll, I guess the Olympic one is certainly clear as far as rolling off, but those other two items, does that let's say stay in the base, does that elevate in the base. I guess payroll was to take advantage of some of the dislocation out there, but how should we think about that going forward?\nEdward Stack\nWell, the payroll is primarily around premium full-service, footwear DICK'S is a big part of it. And then the administration piece is really the investments we're making from an eCommerce standpoint. And we indicated that before you jumped on the call we indicated that to remind everyone that we've talked about going into next when we relaunch our dotcom business on our own platform that you can expect 30 basis points improvement in operating margins. \nSimeon Gutman\nGot it. Okay. Thanks guys. Good luck in the fourth quarter.\nEdward Stack\nThanks.\nOperator\nAnd the next question will come from Camilo Lyon of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.\nCamilo Lyon\nThanks. Good morning, guys. Ed, you mentioned a couple of times that you had meaningful market share growth, could you care to quantify what that is, what do you mean meaningful relative to your expectations for the TSA store close? And then more broadly how do you view that market share capture unfolding in the fourth quarter next year. In other words do you expect your market share gains to accelerate?\nEdward Stack\nWell, we're not going to give you exactly what we saw that it was, but we had a plan of what we thought those market share gains would be and we were really close right on that plan. I think that the fourth quarter will continue to get market share, pickup market share gains, I think we'll be able to able to do that again in the first quarter.\nNow we indicated that we thought this would last for three or four quarters, is this displays market share needs to go some place and we're really confident in our ability to pick that up. We've been executing it right on our plan and we're pretty excited about it.\nCamilo Lyon\nWould you see that rate of recapture is consistent in your expectations going forward or is that something that builds over time is more of those TSA customers are flocking to your stores?\nEdward Stack\nWell, I think it will be relatively consistent, each quarter will have a different pure dollar amount depending on what categories are looking for a home if you will but I would say that would be pretty consistent.\nCamilo Lyon\nAnd then just going back to your guidance, outside of your weather expectations, is there anything that you're seeing in the business that would cause your guidance to effectively have a pretty meaningful of 360 basis points related acceleration?\nEdward Stack\nAgain we're just concern about what's going on with the weather. We would thought that -- we would have hope that would have get colder earlier this year versus what we did in the past, but not really.\nCamilo Lyon\nAnd so that guidance then implies that there is no change in the weather pattern from what you seen in today. Is that how to interpret that?\nEdward Stack\nI would say towards the low end of the guidance, no change to weather pattern versus how it's going today we'd get us toward the lower end of the guidance. And if we return to more seasonable weather for December and January get towards the higher ends of the guidance.\nCamilo Lyon\nOkay, great. And then, just lastly on the license benefit, was there any extension of that benefit in the fourth quarter post the cubs wining the World Series?\nEdward Stack\nYes. Little bit, because they want it in the fourth quarter.\nCamilo Lyon\nGreat. I think one\u2026\nEdward Stack\nFinal game was in the fourth quarter.\nCamilo Lyon\nThank you.\nEdward Stack\nSure.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli\nGood morning, guys. Two questions. First, just to clarify something on that last question, the low end of your 4Q comp guidance assumes weather patterns basically similar to last year then because that kind of went through the full quarter?\nEdward Stack\nRelatively similarly to that.\nScot Ciccarelli\nRelatively similar. Okay. Thank you. And then second, have you guys accelerate the planned rollout of your footwear DICK'S, because I guess, I didn't think the prior plan was roll out to most of the chain, I think that's what you said in your prepared remarks. And then relating to that, is there any color on magnitude or even anecdotal at this point that you can provide to us regarding the lift you're seeing in these new DICK'S because obviously you're continue rollout, so you must be happy with what you're seeing?\nEdward Stack\nYes. We're happy with what we're seeing. We didn't say that it was going out to most of the chain. We said it's going out to most of the new stores that we're opening.\nScot Ciccarelli\nGot it.\nEdward Stack\nBut we are very happy with the lift we've gotten. It's meaningfully different than the stores. They did that, get this lift and we'll continue to assess this and see where we want to go with this. But new stores, most of the new stores will have new forward DICK.\nScot Ciccarelli\nGot it. And by the end of next year then how many footwear DICK'S would we actually have within the base or what percentage, how are you guys want to think for that?\nEdward Stack\nI'm going to say by the end of next year we'll have over 220.\nScot Ciccarelli\nGot it. All right. Thank you, gentlemen.\nOperator\nThe next question will be from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nSteven Forbes\nGood morning. As it relates to the near term revenue trends are associated with the competitive closures, how is that trends were played out by sales channel relative to your original expectations and have you \u2013 maybe it\u2019s too early, but have you seen repeat orders from new customers in both channels that have converted to the brand or is it too early to measure that?\nEdward Stack\nWell, it's a little too early to measure, but we're seeing share gains both throughout the entire omni-channel experience, so both in-store and online.\nSteven Forbes\nAnd I guess relative to your expectations as the channel, maybe don't look at that way, but has the channel mix played out as expected?\nEdward Stack\nYes. We do look at that way and it has been pretty much as expected.\nScot Ciccarelli\nAnd then, just as a follow-up, again, might be too early to comment here, but what is experience thus far regarding to competitive environment in Houston, and/or maybe just comment right on the competitive environment general in markets where there's a greater level of competition post to TSA closures, given the magnitude toes that displace share.\nHouston obviously stands out as you mentioned within the prepared remarks too with the new format and such and the efforts you put there, so any commentary would be helpful?\nEdward Stack\nSure. Houston, we've opened 10 boxes, so we opened six DICK'S stores, two Field & Stream, two Golf Galaxy Stores. Two of the units have it DICK'S Field & Stream and Golf Galaxy all under one roof, which is a terrific shopping experience. We're very pleased with what \u2013 with the Houston opening, we talk about. It was the biggest grand opening in our company's history both not only from the number of stores, but just the total sales volume we did.\nSo we've been very happy with Houston. The Houston market has embraced us. I think we provided different shopping experience than what is down there in a competitive standpoint today. So we're really happy about that. We have not seen any rational behavior through the rest of the country from a competitive standpoint. It's relatively rational out there. And I think it will stay that way through the fourth quarter.\nScot Ciccarelli\nThank you.\nEdward Stack\nSure.\nOperator\nThe next question will be from Adrienne Yih of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAdrienne Yih\nGood morning. Let me add my congratulations. Couple of questions, I guess this first is on the TSA IP, the customer information list. How many on that list are new names to you? And then secondarily, can you give any color on the quarterly progression and quarter to-date comp trends right now. And then for CALIA, we saw the TV advertising, what type of balance did you get from that and how large can that business be in the future? Thank you very much.\nEdward Stack\nSo, as we talk about the progression in the quarter we don't provide guidance or discussion about that or where we are right now. We've never done that, but we're pleased with the way things have been going. As far CALIA, that's one of the brands we're going to continue to invest in. We're very pleased with that. We're actually going to be expanding the square footage in a number of stores to test a broader assortment of [CALIA] continued to be extremely enthusiastic about CALIA. And what was that \u2013 you had one other part of your question.\nAdrienne Yih\nIt was the customer information list, how many of those are new names to you?\nEdward Stack\nYes. We haven't \u2013 we're still de-duping all of that, but there's an off a lot of new names.\nAdrienne Yih\nOkay, great. Thank you much and best of luck.\nEdward Stack\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question will be from Rick Nelson of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nRick Nelson\nThanks and good morning. I think Ed you called out probably $50 million to $55 million for the brand, for the Olympic that's of eComm in the full-service footwear in store, how much of those expenses carry over into 2017?\nEdward Stack\nSo, the footwear DICK, they won't accelerate, so the footwear information or sale of expenses will continue because we've got to operate those. The Olympic expense will not go forward and the expenses associated and the investment associate with eCommerce will slow considerably. And we've indicated that once we've make this change to our own platform the first quarter of next year we expect to see a 30 basis points improvement in our operating margins.\nRick Nelson\nI think you call out early 6 million related to eComm?\nEdward Stack\nRoughly, going into next year.\nRick Nelson\nRight. Okay. And zero were close to it for the Olympic and zero for the full-service in store?\nEdward Stack\nThe full-service won't accelerate anymore, but it will -- that expense will stay in the base. We've got the amortization associated with the capital that we put into the space and then we have the payroll to operate in.\nRick Nelson\nSince every call out whether this is $70 million for this year?\nEdward Stack\nWe never gave for the total year, we did break it out.\nRick Nelson\nOkay. And can you just help us about Field & Stream stores, how they are performing side by side with the DICK'S stores versus the freestanding?\nEdward Stack\nThere's a bit of a difference in the payroll associated, so we think they are doing better, we're pleased with that. We can leverage management expense. We can leverage construction expense associated with them. We leverage a bit of the marketing expense. This triple plays and combo stores we like a lot.\nRick Nelson\nOkay. Thanks and good luck.\nEdward Stack\nThanks, Rick.\nOperator\nAnd the next question will come from Sam Poser of Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser\nGood morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering. I may have been asked. When we think about next year in store openings and white space created by TSA, particularly think of California and Florida, how should we think about I guess your long term store size for DICK'S as well as near closer term of store growth?\nEdward Stack\nSo, Sam, I think as we talked about earlier for next year I think you'll see a slight uptick versus what we did this year, largely as a result of the integration and bringing on the first quarter, 19 of those 22 TSA as we are launching three of them in the fourth quarter. From a size standpoint, I think we like our 50k, but that doesn\u2019t mean that in some markets we won\u2019t be slightly smaller than that based on our small-market and in some markets we won\u2019t go after the market with an 80k from a size standpoint.\nWe continue to have a very rigorous real estate approach and policy, very financially driven and that was again accentuated in the fact that we rejected several of those, about nine of those leases that we acquired from TSA because they did not meet our hurdle rates and they weren\u2019t the right real estate. So, you can expect us to continue to be very focus on how we look at the metrics on a real estate standpoint as we go forward.\nSam Poser\nIf I could just follow-up on that, you\u2019ve got California and Florida that lost a ton of stores. I\u2019m not saying going into where the locations were Sports Authority was. But all of a sudden where there wasn\u2019t, if it was TSA, or Sports Chalet in California, or just TSA in Florida, I mean all of a sudden there is areas that all of a sudden that you wanted there and they were there and all of a sudden you have customers that have been underserved that wasn\u2019t two years ago. So, I mean it just sounds like it creates a huge opportunity. I would even say more in California because of Sports Chalet.\nEdward Stack\nAnd you are right. So if you were to ask us the areas that we are most focused on from a real estate standpoint, I would say it would be Florida, California in the Pac Northwest. Those were areas that we think that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity. California, you are right. TSA and Sports Chalet exiting that market, there is a big opportunity there. And the stores that we took from Sports Authority -- understand we took their very best, some of their very best stores that weren\u2019t competing directly with the DICK\u2019s Sporting Goods store.\nSo, we think these stores are going to be really terrific stores for us. On top of that, we know there\u2019s a lot of white spacing from a real estate standpoint that\u2019s where we are focused on is where Sports Authority\u2019s exited and there is nobody there. There is nobody in Southern California. There is nobody really in Florida in any meaningful way. We think there is opportunity for us.\nSam Poser\nIs that a 17th or an 18th story, I mean just thinking about it?\nEdward Stack\nIt\u2019s a 17th and 18th story because you just can\u2019t turn on the pipeline. We\u2019ve got some real estate that we are looking at there that is going to be ground up. We are going to build new stores. We\u2019ve got some other things that we are looking at, that are going to be taking over existing stores but it takes time to -- and in Florida, in California, which a lot of people not think of this but from a permitting standpoint, they are slow from a permitting standpoint and difficult from a permitting standpoint. So there\u2019s just some lead time to get these stores open and we are working as fast as we can.\nSam Poser\nThank you very much and best of luck.\nEdward Stack\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will be from John Kernan of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kernan\nGood morning, Ed, Andr\u00e9 and Lee. Congrats on a nice quarter.\nEdward Stack\nThank you.\nJohn Kernan\nCan you just talk about the philosophy around the 30 new Golfsmith stores, increases your exposure fairly significantly combined with the 70 plus Golf Galaxy stores? Can you just remind us where the profitability and margins for this category lie in general, both in the Golf stores and in the DICK's Sporting Goods stores?\nEdward Stack\nWe can\u2019t remind you because we never told you. But what we have said is that Golf is still -- although it wasn\u2019t -- it has not been a growing business, it\u2019s still a very important business to us and a very profitable business to us. And with these Golfsmith stores, we took their 30 very best stores.\nWe\u2019ve got lease designation rights on all of them so we could talk to the landlords and see if we can get the right real estate deal on some other ones. But these are very, very profitable stores, they are very best assets and we feel that Golf will be more accretive to earnings than they have been in the past. And we think this is a great -- this has been a great transaction for us.\nI understand when we talked about this, we understood the street may not really like it because there\u2019s not a lot of appetite for Golf but we needed to do the right thing for the business and this is a great opportunity for us to increase our profitability in Golf, which is already a very profitable business for us, if not a growing business. So now for this next year, Golf will be a growing business for us because of the market share for the stores that we are -- the Golfsmith stores we are opening up that were their best stores.\nBut also there is a lot of market share opportunity with Golfsmith going away that is going to be picked up by Golf Galaxy stores and by DICK\u2019s Sporting Goods stores. There is number of -- there\u2019s an awful lot of Golf Galaxy stores and DICK\u2019s stores that are within a very short drive of Golfsmith and we are already starting to see some of that market share get picked up.\nJohn Kernan\nOkay. Sounds like the returns are now -- I\u2019m sorry. Go ahead. Sorry.\nAndre Hawaux\nThe other things that we are doing a little bit with the Golfsmith stores is we are not putting a significant investment into those stores. So, we are going to put in our POS terminals and change the signs from Golfsmith to Golf Galaxy, work on improving our real estate deals there and then go forward with them. So, we are really just buying the inventory in the stores and going forward with profitable stores with very modest investment.\nJohn Kernan\nOkay. Sounds like it will be accretive for next year for sure.\nEdward Stack\nIt absolutely will be accretive.\nJohn Kernan\nOkay. And then my final question, just centers around some topics that were talked about during the elections, one minimum wages. There were several states that approved higher minimum wages for next year and into 2020. And then also on potential lower corporate tax rates, I think you guys pay one of the highest corporate tax rates in our sector right now. So, I\u2019m just wondering how higher minimum wages and how labor rates are going to impact your number, your SG&A for next year and then can you just talk about the potential for lower taxes long-term that would also be helpful? Thanks.\nLee Belitsky\nOn the labor rates, we\u2019ve got that factored into our Q4 outlook as many of those rates went into effect. And as we talk about our outlook for fiscal year 2017 on the fourth quarter call, we will let you know. It\u2019s not material as we\u2019ve looked at this already and looked at it forward it\u2019s not going to be material. It won\u2019t change our long-term outlook. And with respect to tax rates, if we can get lower tax rates that would be great. I think everybody would love a lower corporate tax rate. So, we are all in favor of that.\nJohn Kernan\nOkay. Thanks. Best of luck.\nEdward Stack\nThanks.\nOperator\nThe next question will be from Matt McClintock of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatt McClintock\nHi. Yes. Earlier, you mentioned that it seemed like the competitive environment is rational. I was actually wondering, as you look across the broader competitive landscape and see both footwear and apparel, are you seeing a return to more full-price selling across our competitive peers, especially now that the vendors seem to have cleaned up some of the inventory in shelf?\nEdward Stack\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really more full-price selling but it hasn\u2019t got any more competitive know more -- there is nothing irrational about what\u2019s going on. With that being said, we do expect our merchandise margins to have some more room to run, kind of be a combination of what we are doing from our private brands such as CALIA, Field & Stream. The fact that our inventory is in great shape, you saw our inventory grew at half the rate of our sales, which -- our inventories in great shape. We think that that will mitigate some mark-down exposure on the backend. So, we are enthusiastic about what can happen from a margin rate standpoint.\nMatt McClintock\nThank you very much.\nEdward Stack\nSure.\nOperator\nThe next question will be from Mitch Kummetz of B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nMitch Kummetz\nYes. Thanks for taking my questions. So the fourth quarter earnings guidance, the range of $19.13 that was basically the default guidance previously given kind of where the full year was, what you were saying for Q3. So, it does sound like you being a little bit more cautious on the weather side. I\u2019m wondering if that caution was already baked into the kind of prior default Q4 guidance or if it wasn\u2019t, did something improved kind of offset you being more conservative on the weather side? I don\u2019t know if that question makes sense.\nEdward Stack\nI know what you are trying to say. We are concerned about what\u2019s happening with the weather. When we had talked about the fourth quarter guidance, we really weren\u2019t sure what was going to be the implied fourth quarter guidance.\nMitch Kummetz\nRight.\nEdward Stack\nWhat we gave at the end of our second quarter, so we really didn\u2019t know what was going to happen with the displaced market share with TSA. We had a sense of what we would do. We are able to do very well and be right on our plan for what we felt we would be able to capture. But we are sensitive to the weather in the fourth quarter and we have not gotten any cold weather to speak up. But it has got cold here and there a little bit in the Northeast a couple weeks ago, a couple weekends ago. Business was terrific. It was great. But we are not sure how sustainable that\u2019s going to be.\nMitch Kummetz\nSo, is it fair to say then that you are maybe being a little more cautious on the weather than you were previously but offset that maybe you are being a little more aggressive on the market share gain side so net-net it kind of ends up same way in terms of that range?\nEdward Stack\nI don\u2019t want to get involved and pulled into semantics here but we are concerned about what\u2019s going to happen with the weather.\nMitch Kummetz\nGot it. Fair enough. And then in terms of -- you guys mentioned from a category standpoint, all three, kind of major buckets were up in the quarter in terms of comp. I know you don\u2019t want to get into too much in terms of what the recapture was in the quarter. But from a category standpoint are you seeing any better results from a recapture perspective in certain categories versus others?\nEdward Stack\nWell, so the answer is yes. And then if I leave just at that, your next question will be what can you tell me what categories? So, I will just answer that for you. I\u2019m not going to get into a lot of detail there but we\u2019ve captured it around the areas that we had anticipated. So, we knew that the team sports area would be a big opportunity for us. There is just less competition out there for that area.\nAthletic footwear was really very good. Apparel was good. So, those areas where you would think Sports Authority was strong, when you walk into a Sports Authority store that business has gone that\u2019s where we picked up a lot of market share. The team sports area was one that we thought would be terrific for us and it has been.\nMitch Kummetz\nOkay. And then lastly, I don\u2019t think you guys have got the Field & Stream question yet but I will ask one. There is stores in the comp base there now. I don\u2019t know if you could talk about maybe the performance of those stores. And I would imagine those stores are kind of -- I think you said outdoor in general comps positively but I would guess those stores maybe skew a little bit more towards weather and so, I\u2019m just kind of curios how you are thinking about those stores in the fourth quarter as well?\nEdward Stack\nWell, we are pleased with the performance of those stores and from a profitability standpoint, better than last year we are pleased with those stores. But they are also a bit weather sensitive because the men and women and kids were going hunting. If they are hunting, if they needs boots and they need base layer product, then they need jackets and gloves that\u2019s better for us and if they don\u2019t. Last year, they did. We hope they will this year. But again it\u2019s a bit of a weather story associated with the apparel and boot categories in Field & Stream also. But bottom line is we are pleased with what\u2019s going on with Field & Stream.\nMitch Kummetz\nGot it. All right. Thanks. Good luck.\nEdward Stack\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will be from Joseph Feldman of Telsey. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Feldman\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the stores question for a moment. Can we talk about organic growth? And I know you don\u2019t want to give too much guidance for 2017, but how should we think about organic growth considering the 22 TSA stores, the 30 Golfsmith stores that you have acquired like how will that factor into to how the growth plans will look next year or beyond?\nEdward Stack\nWe actually look at the TSA stores that we are taking over as organic growth. Organic growth is operating at DICK\u2019s Sporting Goods stores right from the ground up these stores are closed. It\u2019s not like we are buying an ongoing business and trying to then integrate it into DICK\u2019s. We are basically -- the TSA deal for us as the Golfsmith deal is really a real estate play for us.\nThe Golfsmith, the TSA stores other than a couple that we are just opening up quickly are going to get renovated and look pretty similar to a DICK\u2019s Sporting Goods store. So, we really think it is all organic growth even the TSA or Golfsmith stores that we are taking over because they are really as I said, just a real estate play.\nJoseph Feldman\nThat makes sense. Okay. So, we should think about the total growth rate for stores or square footage similar to the prior guidance that you\u2019ve given and incorporating those TSA stores, does that make sense?\nEdward Stack\nIn \u201917, it might be a bit higher than what it has been because we are opportunistic about these stores. We had a development plan in place for \u201817 and it started on one for \u201918. We tried to modify to smooth it out a little bit but you could expect that our square footage growth in \u201817 will be greater than it has been. But then it will get back down to a more normal level in \u201818.\nJoseph Feldman\nThanks. And then two other questions. One, Golf and outdoor, I knew were positive and while one quarter or one short period doesn\u2019t make a trend, do you feel like that has turned the corner and we should see more likely positive or at least flat to positive results going forward for the next year?\nEdward Stack\nI would say probably. I would think that -- to be honest with you, I think the golf business -- I\u2019m going to go out and limp here. Our General Counsel is going to kick me under the table. I think that will probably comp positive because of the market share gains. We\u2019ve got a hundred and some DICK\u2019s stores that are within 10 miles of a Golfsmith store that are closing. And the TSA stores did some Golf business too.\nSo, when you think about that we\u2019ve got a 126 DICK\u2019s stores and 26 Galaxy stores that are within 10 miles of the 79 Golfsmith stores that are closing. And then we\u2019ve got 50 DICK\u2019s stores 56 and 11 Golf Galaxy stores that are within 10 miles of the Golfsmith that we are currently operating and some of those may result in a Golf Galaxy store closing in favor of the Golfsmith\u2019s location. So, I think they are going to actually comp positive going forward.\nJoseph Feldman\nThat\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And then the last just re-question. With the election, had you guys seen any impact of pressure on sales to start November? We've heard other retailers talk about little bit of a distraction given the election, especially at the beginning of the month so just curious if you comment on that?\nEdward Stack\nIt was such a short period of time and depending on what happened with the weather and baseball playoffs and this and that, so I couldn\u2019t tell you. We don\u2019t really think it had any impact.\nJoseph Feldman\nGot it. Thanks. Good luck with this quarter, guys. Thank you.\nEdward Stack\nThank you.\nLee Belitsky\nThank you.\nAndre Hawaux\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Patrick McKeever of MKM Partners. Please go ahead.\nPatrick McKeever\nOkay. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a big picture question. Thinking beyond the Sports Authority and Sports Chalet and Golfsmith, how do you view the health of some of the smaller sporting goods players that are still out there, some of the regional, some of the independents? And how do you think about your current market share and the opportunity across the industry as a whole?\nEdward Stack\nWell, I love the position that we are in right now. We\u2019ve got some smaller guys out there and they run their businesses differently. Some are doing very well. I suspect another\u2019s might be having a bit of a difficult time but we love the position that we are in right now. As this industry consolidates, we think that we are best positioned to pick up the lion\u2019s portion of the market share. I think as the industry consolidates, we are the ones that are in position to go back and fill back in to some of those markets where TSA or Sports Chalet is vacated.\nSimilar to Sam\u2019s question when we said, we are really focused on Florida and California from a real estate standpoint. And I think we are the ones that we\u2019ve got the balance sheet to be able to take advantage of those opportunities. We can move quickly and I really like the position that we are in right now.\nPatrick McKeever\nOkay. Got it. And then on the comment about the focus next year being the hub of youth sports or planning to be the hub of youth sports. I saw that with my son\u2019s travel soccer team. I think you are hosting or not hosting but supporting the website through Blue Sombrero I think.\nEdward Stack\nCorrect.\nPatrick McKeever\nSo the question is where do you feel you are market share wise within the youth sports business and what kind of an opportunity do you see there, just even thinking just bigger picture?\nEdward Stack\nSo, depends on how you look at market share for youth sports. So if you look at it from a standpoint do people come and shop our stores for youth sports, I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape there. A lot of these teams though are going to buy their product, whether it would be online or someplace else.\nWe think we\u2019ve got a big market share opportunity there. If we take a look at the market share across this social aspect, if you will of team sports being able to have a technology solution to schedule practices, wear the games, directions to the games all of that stuff, I think we are in a very early innings here and we think we\u2019ve got a big opportunity.\nThe amount of names that we are massing through, Blue Sombrero or Affinity that we bought, how we are growing these names and how we think we can market to these young men, women, their parents, coaches, administrator. We think that there is a big opportunity here that we are in a great position to unlock and one of the reasons that there is other competitors in this space.\nBut we think we are going to do -- have already done very well and are going to continue to do very well and be the largest market share recipient here because we can provide these services for free where others have a difficult time doing that because we can monetize this to the sale of product and how we can market them to come into our stores, others can\u2019t. So, we think there is a very big opportunity that nobody has tapped and there is nobody in our industry that can tap this potential the way that we can.\nPatrick McKeever\nGreat. Thanks, Ed.\nEdward Stack\nThanks.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Jim Chartier of Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Please go ahead.\nJim Chartier\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just curious were you able to leverage the customer list and email databases at Sports Authority to impact your back-to-school or third quarter marketing plans in general and is there a greater opportunity given that you had longer time to look at the data, the impact of fourth quarter business with that information.\nAndre Hawaux\nWell, actually the third quarter we weren\u2019t. The things were baked and we\u2019re still going. So, the answer is, knowing the third quarter very little impact if anything. It will have a much bigger impact in the fourth quarter and going into the first quarter and second quarter of next year.\nJim Chartier\nDoes that have an opportunity for kind of incremental gains versus what you are able to achieve in third quarter?\nAndre Hawaux\nWe hope so!\nJim Chartier\nGreat. And then, you mentioned earlier, I think multiple new private brand launches plan for next year, how do the Sports Authority and Golfsmith private brands play into that and which part of the assortment do you see the most opportunity.\nAndre Hawaux\nThe one from the sports authority that we think will have an opportunity to launch around Alpine sports, the cold weather category. The other one are couple of things that we are doing organically that we are not ready to discuss yet, but we think we're pretty excited about them and I think to have a big impact a couple of years down the road.\nAnd what we are able to do with CALIA in a short period of time making that now as a number three women\u2019s athletic brand in roughly a two year timeframe gives a lot of confidence that we can move market share when we want to.\nJim Chartier\nSounds great. Thanks and best of luck.\nAndre Hawaux\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will be from Chris Svezia of Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nChris Svezia\nThank you very much for taking my questions. I guess the first one, Ed just for you. Just on the inventory as it relates to outerwear cold-weather merchandise, whether you want to fix specifically or just in the channel coming into this fall, there's a lot of inventory supposedly in the channel off price. Just maybe your thought and context relative to the weather and the inventories that\u2019s out there and how you think about in the context of DICK\u2019S and their performance in that category?\nEdward Stack\nWell, our inventory is in great shape. So, we are right on plan. We\u2019ve got some flexibility on how we manage our inventory going forward. So whether it\u2019s cold or whether it\u2019s warm we will be in pretty good shape from an inventory standpoint we suspect. I mean, obviously it would be better if it\u2019s cold than it\u2019s warm, but we don't think we\u2019ve got any significant exposure. Our team has done a great job. Planning for that having contingencies associated with the weather pattern.\nChris Svezia\nOkay. And you don\u2019t think there is any exposure sort of off price channels, other retailers in the category that would negatively impact you guys?\nEdward Stack\nWhat might happen later in the quarter I am not sure, but right now we don\u2019t see anything.\nChris Svezia\nOkay. With regard to the fourth quarter and just to say that the SG&A, it\u2019s just a question around that. It looks like in the third quarter, sort of the non-GAAP SG&A dollar the increase year-over-year roughly $66 million or thereabouts and kind of back into your guidance for the fourth quarter from an earnings perspective, it looks like the SG&A dollar increase would be about the same give or take. I\u2019m just curious given the kind of roll off of the Olympics what other increases are there potentially in that fourth quarter that maybe we are not thinking about previously whether it\u2019s Goldsmith and that\u2019s now a part of the cost or incentive comp or things like that, is there anything else that\u2019s going on in that number that you are thinking about?\nAndre Hawaux\nYes so we got a couple of things. One, the quarter is just is just bigger and we\u2019ve got comps built in at up between 3% and 6%. The other piece would be incentive comp year-over-year movement it\u2019s going to be also a factor and we continue to have investments in premium full service footwear and we have investments as we come to the end of our eCommerce road map into getting ready to launch the site. That was even over all four quarters, so you\u2019ll see some of that. What\u2019s really tailed off in the fourth quarter would be the Olympic spend which was predominantly in the third quarter.\nChris Svezia\nOkay, thanks Andre. And just finally, just optically, when you step back I think about the market share gains that you are getting, is it costing you any more than you maybe initially thought to get those market share gains in Sports Authority or Sports Chalet or is it actually maybe more accretive than you thought. I guess the question is just is it costing you more to get those share gains....?\nAndre Hawaux\nNo, it\u2019s basically right on plans. We\u2019re right where we anticipated we\u2019d be.\nChris Svezia\nOkay, good to hear. All the best around the holiday. Thank you.\nAndre Hawaux\nThank you. You too.\nOperator\nAnd the final question will come from Peter Benedict of Robert Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Benedict\nAll right guys, thanks for sneaking it in. Three quick ones, first just on the Golfsmith stores, are they more profitable than your Golf Galaxy stores and if so why?\nEdward Stack\nWell the stores that we bought, I would say are probably going to be more profitable than the Golf Galaxy stores on average, because we brought the best stores. So if you took a look at our best stores, their best stores, that should be a whole lot of difference, but we on average these will be accretive because we got their best stores.\nPeter Benedict\nOkay, understood that makes sense. And then secondly, you talked about CALIA and some of the footwear decks, any other brands or categories that are going to be seeing some square footage allocation changes in the core DICK stores, I\u2019m thinking particularly about the holiday and then maybe plans for next year?\nEdward Stack\nYes around the holiday not an awful lot difference than you know what we are doing with CALIA, a little bit Field & Stream but you won\u2019t see a huge difference this fourth quarter and into next spring we are still working through some of those issues. You will see some changes, you will see Adidas get more space next year than they have this year and actually in the fourth quarter they might get a little bit of \u2013 a little bit of space in some stores in the fourth quarter, but next year we expect to see the biggest change in square footage would be around Adidas.\nPeter Benedict\nOkay. Perfect, thanks. Then lastly just on the outdoor category, the positive comps, can you give us a little more color what the drivers were there, was it kind of across the category or was it driven by one, or a few items, was it firearms or camping etcetera?\nEdward Stack\nWell that outdoor camp water sports paddle area has been very good for us and that\u2019s where the biggest growth would have come from?\nPeter Benedict\nOkay, great. Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Ed Stack for his closing remarks.\nEdward Stack\nI\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us for our third quarter call and we\u2019ll look forward to talking to everyone after the holiday season. Best of luck to everyone. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.\n\n",

My name is Modesta, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nBarbara Gasper\nThank you, Modesta. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, either by phone or webcast, for a discussion about our second quarter 2011 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris McWilton, President of the U.S. Market. Following comments from Ajay, Chris and Martina, we will open up the call for your questions.\nThis morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. The earnings release and slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A dial-in replay of this call will be available for 1 week, through August 10. \nFinally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajay Banga. Ajay?\nAjay Banga\nThank you, Barbara.  Good morning, everybody. As usual, Martina will get into the details of our results but let me just start with some high-level comments. In the second quarter, we saw net revenue growth of 22.1%, 18% actually on a constant currency basis, driven by hiking growth rates and GDV, cross-border volume and process transactions. This help fuel operating income growth of 23.3%, net income growth of 32.8% and an EPS growth of 36.4%. \nSo we delivered another quarter with strong results including record quarterly GDV, over $800 billion and our third consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth. Within our geographies, the strongest growth remained in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa region. \nIn Europe, consumers continue to spend domestically and abroad. In the United States, we posted our strongest quarterly volume growth since the fourth quarter of 2007. This was led by Debit, which is benefiting from the roll-on of new business wins, as well as continued strength in promotional credit. \nConsumer credit growth in the United States remains positive and was up slightly over the first quarter, but year-on-year is strong as either of debit or commercial credit. \nOn the other side of the strong growth is what we are all seeing in the global economy. In Europe, consumer sentiment is lower than it has been in recent months, again, not surprising given the sovereign debt issues and concerns around the economic growth that persists in sovereign markets in Europe. And of course, we have our own issues here in the U.S. The economic signals remain mixed, unemployment remains above 9%, the housing market remains relatively weak, both are likely contributing to consumer sentiment in the United States being at its lowest level in 2 years. \nOur SpendingPulse data shows that retail sales growth x auto and gas has remained above 6% over the last 4 months, including July. However, much of this increase is likely driven by inflation, given persistently higher prices for gas and other commodities\nAnd of course in addition, easier year-over-year comparisons might be fueling some of this percentage growth given the significant slowdown in spending we saw during the summer months of last year. Latin America and Asia on the other hand seem to have a brighter picture, both in terms of economic performance and consumer sentiment. But even there, given the nature of the global economy, the second half of the year could well be more measured than the first half, in terms of economic indicators. \nOverall, it feels like the global economy is still struggling to get back on solid footing. But as I said earlier, consumer spending appears to be holding up through this volatility. With this as a backdrop, we remain cautiously optimistic about our business. \nI'm sure that you're all keen to hear about the debit business so we've got Chris McWilton, the President of our U.S. region to talk to you. Chris?\nChris McWilton\nThank you, Ajay. A little d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It's been awhile since I've been on an earnings call but good to be with you on the phone today.\nAjay Banga\nBe careful what you wish for.\nChris McWilton\nOver the last several quarters, the Durbin Amendment and its potential impact on our business and our customers has been top of mind for us, and I'm sure many of you on the phone today. With the Fed issuing its final rule in late June, there's now greater clarity and we're moving forward with our strategy, based on scenario planning and making the necessary operational changes. \nI really doubt we'll be able to answer all of your questions on today's call because there's still a lot of moving pieces that need to play out. But I think it's important to share with you what we can today. \nThe exclusivity provisions of the Durbin Amendment were designed to provide merchants with the ability to direct the routing of debit transactions over competing networks. Therefore, it is not surprising that large merchants are looking for incentives from the networks for routing preference. At the same time, acquirers for smaller merchants see themselves as directing routing to debit networks when there are multiple PIN marks on the card. They, too, are seeking incentives for routing. \nAnd finally, issuers are looking to reduce the cost, complexity and uncertainty of maintaining multiple PIN network functionality on their debit cards. They will need to decide whether they put 1 exclusive PIN mark on their cards or maintain multiple marks. \nWe're confident that the superior value proposition our PIN debit offering brings will result in more U.S. debit cards with our mark in them. Remember, that Maestro is the only globally interoperable PIN POS network, accepted at more locations globally than any other brand. \nUntil those PIN mark decisions are made, it is difficult for anyone to predict what kind of PIN debit shares shifts might occur among the networks. It is also tough to know how rebate and incentive structures might change until there's more clarity around routing decisions. \nThe battle lines over routing are still unfolding, being the smaller player in U.S. Debit, MasterCard is in a completely different competitive situation. Ours is one of potential upside, not the need to defend a large incumbent position. As a result, we will be looking at strategic surgical opportunities with issuers, acquirers and merchants to incent new PIN enablement on cards, as well as routing to our network. \nOur final pricing approach will be dependent on how much we win on the back of the card and in what form, exclusive for multiple marks. Therefore, a deal-specific approach is needed to give us the flexibility to navigate all the complexities. For competitive reasons, we cannot expand further on the details right now. \nIn addition, we have made some initial decisions to help customers with a new reality of these rules. We recently informed our issuers that we will implement a 2-tiered interchange structure across both debit and prepaid products for issuers above and below the $10 billion asset level. We continue to work through the operational details of the structure and will be working with issuers and acquirers to implement the necessary changes prior to October 1.\nA potential risk that investors often ask me about is related to the issuer debit pricing going forward. It didn't take the Durbin Amendment to create a competitive pricing environment, it existed long before that and expect that it would've continued even without the new regulations. \nAs you know, under the final Fed regs, network processing fees are not regulated, but are now included in the debit interchange calculations.\nSo any impact on network processing fees for debit will ultimately flow back to the calculation of the interchange rate, which should provide some moderation in issuers thinking about network pricing. We will work to help our customers and consumers recognize the superior value of MasterCard's PIN debit offering by continuing to innovate product features and functionality that will allow our customers flexibility to both control their cost and generate incremental revenue. \nLast September, at our Investor Day, I told you that I was confident that whatever the final outcome of the Durbin Amendment, it would present MasterCard with net opportunities to grow its U.S. Debit business and I continue to feel that way. As we only have about a 9% share of PIN debit transactions today, we continue to believe the exclusivity provisions of the Durbin Amendment providing net opportunity for us. \nThe pending decisions by issuers, merchants and acquirers will influence routing and also ultimately determine how much opportunity we have. However, please remember that PIN debit economics, pre-Durbin, were quite thin and will become even thinner after paying routing incentives. As a result, volume growth rates will exceed revenue growth rates as the space unfolds. \nLet me also take a minute to remind you that lower revenue yield does not necessarily equal lower operating margin. Given the scalability of our network, we are able to process additional transactions at a very low incremental cost. We will be strategic and selective when considering situations where we're willing to pay enhanced economics for routing. Let me hand the call back to Ajay now for the business highlights discussion. Ajay?\nAjay Banga\nThanks, Chris. So while all of this going on in the U.S., we remain focused on executing our growth strategy around the rest of the world. That's why I'll take a moment to highlight a few recent news items. Let's start with Prepaid. So early in the second quarter, as you know we've completed the acquisition of the Card Program Management business of Travelex, which we are now bring in Access Prepaid worldwide. \nBut of course we are in the midst of converting non- MasterCard branded portfolios in their book. But in addition, I'm pleased to say we have signed our first new access prepaid deal since the close it's for Ryanair , Europe's leading low-cost airline. We will be the Prepaid Card Program manager in 5 markets with issuance beginning this year itself. In the U.S., we launched 2 MasterCard general-purpose reloadable card programs into Walmart's 3,500 U.S. stores. The program is based from consumer insights from targeting that we actually brought proactively to Walmart. \nIn the spring, with our partner at SunTrust, we'll launch the SunTrust Campus card. This integrate is 2 ID card with a MasterCard reloadable Prepaid Card. Another example, the Turkish Post Office, which is one of the largest government institutions that performed financial services, has now signed a contract with us to issue cobranded credit, debit and prepaid cards under the MasterCard and Maestro brands. \nAlso during the second quarter, we signed a new multi-product agreement with Swedbank, one of the largest issuers in the Nordics and Baltics region. The Debit MasterCard portion of this agreement will significantly increase our Debit footprint in this region, where the Debit category is growing 4x faster than Credit. The agreement does include commercial and consumer credit as well, and we expect the results of the deal to show up in the market early next year. \nIn South Africa, Absa, one of the country's largest banks, has begun to convert 2 portfolios to World MasterCard, the first of an affluent credit portfolio and a pillar of Absa's affluent banking strategy, and the second is actually fairly interesting, it's the conversion of its Islamic-compliant debit card to World Debit MasterCard, the first of its kind in the region. \nWe have a couple of new deals in our Commercial business as well. While we signed at HSBC for the 2012 launch of a commercial card offering for businesses with operations across Continental Europe. In Latin America, we launched 2 small business commercial card programs with Banco de Bogot\u00e1, whose commercial programs have actually been exclusively with a competitive bank.\nTurning to mobile, we are making traction in key markets around the world, as we look to help define what the ecosystems look like in these markets. In Turkey, Turkcell and Yapi Kredi have launched a mobile world of service with MasterCard PayPass, and consumers can basically just exchange their SIM cards for NFC-enabled cards. And of course, we continue to build PayPass acceptance in Turkey, where the largest acquirers has now enabled their terminals at thousands of locations to accept PayPass.\nIn mid-May, Barclaycard and Orange launched their first commercially available NFC enabled for the U.K. as powered by MasterCard PayPass, is currently available for purchase by consumers at retail outlets of Orange. In the U.S. as you've heard, we are partnering with Google, Citi, Sprint and First Data in the development of the Google Wallet, the Wallet will come preloaded with a Mastercard Prepaid Card and initially, Citibank cardholders will be able to load that PayPass enabled credit cards into the Wallet. \nAlso in the U.S., Isis, the JV created by the major U.S. telcos has announced that it is opening its efforts to include all the major payment networks, and as I said earlier we believe this was a critical step in the future success of Isis. Open systems allow for the required scale in this space. For this effort and for the others, we're actually excited about the capability that MasterCard can bring to bear. \nFinally, last example in June, we signed the first broad commercial agreement stemming from our MOU with China UnionPay. The agreement will equip the MasterCard payment gateway with the ability to process e-commerce transactions made with CUP cards. [ph] And also we've extended our MOU with CUP for another 4 years and as we're quite pleased to be working closely with them for nondomestic transactions. \nAnd as you know, as an example, the core brand deals in China that we have talked about in previous earnings calls are helping to drive cross-border volume growth when cardholders travel outside of China. So with those examples, let me turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update of our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nThank you, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck, which shows our reported results versus last year's second quarter. \nAs you just heard, we had a terrific quarter. Net revenue grew over 22% driven by very strong volume and transaction growth across our base business, as well as the addition of new deals. Acquisitions contributed about 3 percentage points to this growth, resulting in a very robust top line growth rate of 19%, excluding acquisitions. \nTotal operating expenses were up 20.8%, which included about 7 percentage points of expenses coming from the inclusion of acquisition. Therefore, expense growth, excluding acquisitions was 14%. Overall, foreign exchange contributed roughly 4 percentage points to both net revenue and operating expense growth. Operating income was up 23.3%. This resulted in an operating margin for the quarter of 53.1%, up from 52.6% in last year's second quarter. Bottom line, we delivered net income of $608 million, up 32.8% and diluted earnings per share of $4.76, up 36.4%. \nSo over the next couple of slides, representing the operational metrics for the second quarter of 2011 compared to the same quarter a year ago. \nOn Page 4, you can see the worldwide growth dollar volume, or GDV, was up 16.4% on a local currency basis or 23.6% on a U.S. dollar converted basis. As Ajay said, this is the first time quarterly GDV has exceeded $800 billion. This is driven by the highest quarterly growth rate we have seen in more than 4 years. \nU.S. volume growth was 9.9%. And across the rest of the world, volume growth was 19.9% on a local currency basis, including almost 25% growth in both APMEA and Latin America. \nWorldwide credit volume grew 13.3% on a local currency basis, which breaks down into 5.3% growth for the U.S. and 16.5% for the rest of the world. Worldwide debit volume grew 22.2% on a local currency basis. In the U.S., debit growth was 15.1% and outside of the U.S., debit growth was 28.5% with the highest growth rate coming from APMEA and Europe.\nCross-border volume growth on a local currency basis was up 19.3%, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This was supported by double-digit growth in every region, including the United States.\nTurning now to Slide 5. Our process transactions were up 17.4%, compared with the year-ago quarter to $6.6 billion. This was the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. While it was driven by Latin America and APMEA, all regions experienced healthy growth in process transactions. This included the U.S. which was up double digits for the first time since the third quarter of 2008, as new business, such as our SunTrust and Sovereign wins has overtaken the diminishing impact of prior debit portfolio losses. Overall growth in process transactions was further aided by our expanded processing relationship with Ita\u00fa in Brazil and domestic processed transactions that we have picked up in the Netherlands. \nGlobal card growth was 6.4% to about $1.7 billion MasterCard and Maestro cards. The number of MasterCard-branded cards surpassed $1 billion for the first time led by a greater than 20% increase in debit card. \nNow let's turn to Page 6 to discuss revenue versus last year's second quarter in a bit more detail. Net revenue generated outside of the U.S. represented 60% of total revenues compared with 57% last year. This shift was driven by revenues growing at a higher rate outside of the U.S. at about 30% compared with 12% growth for U.S. revenue. \nTurning to the components of net revenue. Domestic assessments increased 24.5% primarily due to strong volume growth. Cross-border volume fees increased 9.2%. But if you exclude the impact of the October 2010 cross-border pricing structure change, these fees actually increased about 25% driven by double-digit cross-border volume growth in all regions. \nTransaction processing fees grew 18.2%, driven largely by growth in process transactions due to the new business in Latin America, in Europe and in the United States. Other revenue grew 41.9%, driven mainly by the inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of Access Prepaid worldwide. As an aside, all of Access Prepaid revenue is included in the other revenue line item. This is in contrast to revenue from our acquisition of DataCash, which is included in 3 of our revenue lines; domestic assessments, transaction processing fees and other revenue.\nIn total, growth revenue increased by $373 million or 20.5%. Now rebates and incentives were at $534 million, up $71 million or 15.5%. However, the increase was about $130 million or roughly 33% when you adjust for the cross-border pricing change. This increase was due to the impact of new and renewed deals, as well as stronger volume performance. Overall, net revenue growth benefited by approximately 2 percentage points from pricing. \nNow let's turn to Page 7 for some details on expenses. Within total operating expense, our general and administrative expenses increased by 24.8% or 21.3% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and other expenses related to the inclusion of acquisitions and strategic growth initiatives, such as mobile, prepaid and information services. In total, acquisitions contributed about 8 percentage points to G&A growth.\nAdvertising and marketing expenses was up 7.1%, with almost 5 percentage points of this growth driven by foreign exchange fluctuations. Sponsorships, as well as customer-specific and strategic initiatives accounted for most of the remainder. \nDepreciation and amortization increased 43.2%, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets from our recent acquisitions. \nSo let's move to the cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights on Page 8. We generated $538 million in cash from operations in the second quarter and the end of the quarter, with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of $3.6 billion. We repurchased about 1.5 million shares of Class A stock during the second quarter at a cost of approximately $387 million. And in the third quarter, through July 28, we actually purchased almost 78,000 additional shares at a cost of about $24 million. So year-to-date, through July 28, we have repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of about $1.1 billion and have $935 million remaining of the $2 billion in total authorization. We will continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.\nTurning to Slide 9. Let's discuss 2011 and I'll start with an update of what we have seen for MasterCard processed volumes for the third quarter through July 28. Our cross-border volumes grew 22% globally, ahead of what we saw in the first and second quarters. This was driven by double-digit growth in all regions with slight upticks in growth in APMEA, Europe and the United States. Although not a perfect proxy for GDV, total U.S. processed volume grew 12%, ahead of the levels that we saw in the first and the second quarter. Higher gas prices are contributing a little bit, perhaps a couple of percentage points to this growth rate, which is further benefiting from an easy year-over-year comparison. \nRecall that U.S. processed volume growth was actually slightly negative in July of 2010. In July, total processed volume growth for the rest of the world was about 24%, slightly ahead of the 22% pace we saw in the second quarter due to an uptick in growth in APMEA and Europe. And globally, process transaction growth was 20% ahead of the 17% growth we saw in the second quarter and the 11% growth we saw in the first quarter. And this is really in part due to Ita\u00fa in Brazil, a domestic processing in the Netherlands and the U.S. debit deals coming on line. \nSo based on what we see now, this is our view for 2011 on a constant currency basis. We had a strong first half with net revenue growth of 18.5%, and we continue to expect that the second half growth will be slightly higher. Keep in mind that deconversions will have a diminishing impact on the second half. And additionally, Access Prepaid closed in mid-April and therefore, will contribute to both the third and the fourth quarter while it only contributed to part of the first half of the year.\nFinally, the DataCash acquisition closed in late October last year and therefore, would anniversary in the fourth quarter. Regarding foreign exchange, if current rates for the euro and the rial hold for the balance of the year, we would expect a full year net tailwind of around 2 to 3 percentage points to revenue. \nAnd our views in operating expenses remained unchanged as well. We remain committed to our target of a minimum 50% annual operating margin and continue to expect only a small operating margin expansion in 2011, relative to 2010.\nOperating expenses continue to include investments in strategic areas, such as mobile, e-commerce, Prepaid and Commercial. It will also include the operating expenses of both DataCash and Access Prepaid worldwide. The vast majority of the impact of these acquisitions will be felt in G&A, which is likely to be up about a similar dollar amount year-over-year in each of the third and the fourth quarters, as it was in the second quarter. As a reminder, there will also be an impact to depreciation and amortization, which we now expect to grow more than 35% versus 2010. \nIn total, as we said on our last earnings call, the acquisitions will contribute more to growth of operating expense for the full year than they will to growth of net revenue. We expect the acquisitions to have a $0.04 to $0.06 dilutive impact to EPS for the full year. We now expect the proportion of annual advertising and marketing spend by quarter to be similar to the patterns we saw in both 2009 and 2010. And for modeling purposes, we now believe that the 2011 full year tax rate could be slightly lower than the 33% we originally communicated due to the currently expected impact of some of our tax planning initiatives.\nNow let's discuss our long-term financial objectives. Each year, we address our objectives. We evaluate any potential changes in the economic environment, business development and other issues on a global basis that might impact our overall financial outlook. And while you have heard Ajay discuss the global environment and Chris talked specifically about our U.S. Debit business, our overall assessment is that our long-term financial objective remain unchanged. For the 2011 to 2013 period, these objectives are: A net revenue compounded annual growth rate of 12% to 14%; a minimum annual operating margin of 50%; and an earnings per share compounded annual growth rate of at least 20%. \nFinally, we have said that these objectives are all on a constant currency basis and exclude acquisitions, with the exception of DataCash and Access Prepaid worldwide.\nSo with that let me now turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session.\nBarbara Gasper\nThank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Operator?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]  Your first question today comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.\nAjay or Chris, could you maybe just talk about from your conversations with bank issuers, what they're thinking about that 1 mark or 2 marks on the back of the card and kind of the pluses and minuses when thinking through that decision? And then maybe just, are they thinking of other alternatives, in terms of card products other than debit cards, maybe something along the lines of credit to offset some lost debit economics?\nChris McWilton\nSure, Sanjay. What the issuers are thinking about with the place and the marks would be adding a functionality of PIN debit on the back is to do a number of things and I mentioned these in my remarks. One is there's operational complexity with maintaining multiple PIN debit functionality. You have to maintain, we call them, pipes or communication lines into the different networks, so there's some added complexity to that. The other thing they're thinking about is just the fact that having multiple marks on the cards does feed some additional routing ability to the merchants. So in addition to being able for the merchant to route between signature and PIN, they now have the ability to route with multiple marks on the card between signature and perhaps one or more PIN marks. So there comes with that a level of uncertainty and a level of preferences given to the merchant in their routing consideration. So they're thinking through that. Obviously, they're also thinking through, in addition to products they're thinking through how they price for the different services that the deposit holders have with their institutions, whether that's annual fees for checking accounts, whether it's fees for the debit cards themselves reducing perhaps the cost base of their products by perhaps limiting their usage to just the United States. Some of them are considering limiting the amount that can actually go on a debit card, limiting the transaction amount, et cetera. And of course, they're looking at credit again as write-off rates start to moderate as we come to the economic cycle. Credit again is beginning to look a little bit more attractive as a revenue replacement.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.\nYes, can you just give us the numbers on how much your revenue and volume growth and maybe even transaction growth, to what extent it benefited from the portfolio conversions of SunTrust and Sovereign in the quarter?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nRod, it's Martina. At this point in time, we just have a little bit of a better benefit when you combine both the debit deconversions, the 2 portfolios that we had actually lost in the United States as well as the add-on of the several portfolios that we actually won. So there was a slight benefit and we are really expecting to turn the corner in the third quarter.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.\nFor just so we can quantify the impact on the acceleration, can you tell us what the benefit was from SunTrust and Sovereign?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nNo, Rod, we are not breaking those numbers out. As I said, there was a slight benefit in total.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.\nOkay, and then just a couple of quick clarifications. Can you specify where the 2 points of pricing came from? Was that from the merchant acquired fee increase lingering from April of 2010? And then I just want to make sure I heard you correct. I think you might have said that U.S. transaction growth was negative in the month of July, but I want to make sure I heard that right.\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nNo, so first of all on your last question that was July of 2010, when actually U.S. GDV growth was negative. And with respect to your first question from the 2 percentage points of pricing, you had about 50 basis points in there which was really a lapping impact from the price actions that we took back in April of 2010. And then the remainder was really a lot of diversified small pricing actions all around the globe, so there's no one particular big impact from any particular action.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.\nAnd then just the final thing, will some of those small pricing effects continue over the next year or are they largely anniversarying at this point?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nNo, you have a number of them that were actually implemented in January of 2011 and a couple that we implemented in April of 2011. So you'll have, for the rest of the year until the first second quarter of next year, you'll have a bit of a benefit there.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.\nGlenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley\nQuestion for Ajay, TransUnion recently put out an analysis suggesting consumers have been on a trend of aggressively paying down credit card balances. I just wonder what you think this could mean for the trajectory of the U.S. credit growth over the next 1 to 3 years? I mean, does it imply there's a lot of dry powder now for spending or do you think this reflects the cultural shift away from credit and then continue on, on this point?  Do you think the U.S. credit market can realistically get to, say, high single-digit growth in payment volumes again or it's mid-single digit about what we should think about?\nAjay Banga\nProbably a not a good guy to give you the last part, as in high single-digit versus mid-single digit of the long-term because it's a little difficult to predict that level of activity today. But I would say this to you, the down payments, the increased payments on that card balances that you read about are comprised of 2 things. One part is actually if we take the gross numbers, is the level of write-off, there are number of banks in the United States that had to take over the last few years and that tends to decrease the total outstanding in their system by a fairly large amount. You've got to just keep that in mind we are looking to total number, otherwise you could mix up the write-offs with the actual change in consumer behavior. Then there's the actual numbers of what consumers are doing with higher spending. I mean, spending rate these days and the spending rate are very different from what they were 3 years ago. In fact, a year back, the U.S. savings rate were up to 6%, 7%. They went back down to 4.5%, 5% recently released numbers. Although I'd wait to make sure those are very accurate, sure that about 5%, 5.5% of consumer savings is what you're seeing. \nSo they're all that transfer into a secular changing in the behavior towards credit. I don't think you can jump to that conclusion yet. And the consumer, they're rebalancing their balance sheet are going through somewhat uncertain time, I think those that are unemployed for quite a while now, are not quite clear how they'll get back to employment, but I do believe that those who are employed have a lower fear of an impending unemployment event on the horizon for them. And so you've got 2 kinds of consumers even in that list. That is all that's put together would lead me to conclude that I wouldn't come to a set of conclusion that says that secular change in credit is happening. I just wouldn't get there yet. I think that with the advent of all these rules in debit, as somebody asked earlier, I think it's Rod, I think you will find banks trying to relook at their ability to generate revenue, given that their credit cycle has changed in tone for a number of the banks. And I think that itself will drive a new form of offers and promotions and willingness to take on risk with the banks over the next couple of years. Some of them, by the way, have already been doing that for the last year or so already. So it's a mixed bag. I would just tell you don't conclude that secular change is happening. That's too early.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.\nJason Kupferberg\nI just wanted to pick up on some of Chris's comments earlier, in terms of the post-Durbin world here. Have you guys been asked by any of your issuer customers to revisit or renegotiate their contracts at this point? And if so, how far are you into that process and have you been able to obtain extensions on any of these contracts as part of those negotiations?  Because I think in the past, you guys have said that you have 1 big contract renewal in each of the next 3 years. And then if you can also just tack on to that any quick update you might have on the merchant litigation, that would be great.\nChris McWilton\nWe're limiting our discussions to issuer contracts just to compliant specifically with the Durbin regulations. So in situations where we have exclusivity provisions, which is fairly limited on our debit card base or the computation of, or the incentives that go into the computation of the netzero calculation, which I'm sure some of you are quite familiar with, make them into play. So we would have to discuss with our issuers changes in terms and conditions around that. But as we said before, we do not have material average change clauses in our contracts, and we believe that the value we provide of our debit network is consistent with the pricing we have in place today. So we think we're in pretty good shape from a pricing pressure standpoint with those little debit contracts with the exception of having to work through the netzero calculations. And for an update on litigation, I'm going to defer to Barbara because that's not my area of expertise.\nBarbara Gasper\nBefore we get to that, I just want to add on one thing, Jason. When we actually quote that we have contract renewals in -- 1 big contract renewal in each of the next 3 years, that was not limited to the United States. That was a global statement, okay, so, it is all of our business globally.\nAjay Banga\nAnd on the merchant litigation, there is nothing new compared to what we've written in our public disclosures. This stuff has been carrying on for years. There's a trial date scheduled for September 2012. They're all in mediation, which is a lot of fun as you can imagine. We've made substantial progress in negotiations with the individual merchant plaintiffs, about [indiscernible] -- we've got no such comment to make about the class merchants. And since the individual merchants represent less than 5% of the purchase volume of the class, I really don't know where this mediation will go right now, so it's still out there. All we have is the judgment settlement sharing agreement that we've already announced with you last earnings that I remember.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.\nFollowing on your discussions in Netherlands, I was wondering if the problems that European banks are having might be hastening negotiations to outsource processing and move on to Maestro and whatnot to comply with separate banks?\nAjay Banga\nHi, Craig. It's Ajay. I don't think that I've yet to -- that I can say that they are hastening any of those discussions. Europe tends to move at a glacial pace because of the complexity of the number of banks, the country rules and the EC rules. That's a fairly complex needle to thread your thread through. So you should not expect dramatic moves up and down. Having said that, the breakthrough we have in The Netherlands was very welcome and very helpful. In fact, our European processing volume that we now see was up this quarter over 100%. Whereas if you remember the last earnings call, I talked about over 40-odd percent. So in a sense that is an improvement in that number, it's caused largely by this Netherlands piece. There are lots of negotiations going on with a number of banks, but don't conclude it's because of any reason. This work has been going on for years.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co\nGreat results, happy to see you're investing as well. I guess I'll ask about Visa's network participation fee, what the implications would mean for Mastercard. I'm asking because it's a pretty drastic change in how acquiring fees are going to be billed, so I wonder if Mastercard needs to match that?\nChris McWilton\nTien-Tsin, it's Chris. At this point in time, we don't see a need to match it. As I said in my comments, we're going to be very thoughtful and very surgical in how we approach the opportunities in PIN and signature debit as it unfolds under Durbin. As I mentioned, there's a lot of moving parts that need to be sorted through and to put in place a sort of a blanket across the board. Network participation fee, I think, suboptimizes our economics when it comes to grabbing some of this opportunity. So we are going to be looking perhaps at specific acquiring relationships. We're going to be looking at certain verticals of merchants and certain categories of merchants that we believe will provide the best market share increase for the best economics. I mean our objective is not to go out there and buy every PIN transaction that exist in the U.S. today, to do it in a very thoughtful way with more precise economic tactics than a network participation fee.\nAjay Banga\nTien-Tsin, this is Ajay. When this regulation came out we've been working our way through different situations. The basis of everything we've looked at is that we have a lower market share and our position, therefore, is different. We don't need to defend as much as find ways to find the chinks in the place that we could build and capitalize on. And that's the reason we're looking at it rather than doing any blanket pricing or blanket efforts for acquirers or for merchants, large or small or for issuers large or small. We still think our benefit comes from being flexible deal-by-deal and thoughtful deal-by-deal because of where we stand, versus some of our large competitors, who, I think are doing things that are appropriate for their market position.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc\nAjay, your growth in regions, such as Asia continues to be very strong. I was curious if you think you're still in a market share gain mode, or work suggest that you are. I just wonder if you could comment on some of the regional networks from a competitive standpoint, maybe talk about comp, how you see them, is there a merchant actually a benefit for you or does it become [indiscernible]?\nAjay Banga\nDon, we are still very much keen to make sure that not only do we benefit from the secular growth of spending on electronic payments and the move from cash to electronic payments and frankly the benefit of growing middle classes and global traveler region like Asia. We want to benefit from all that. But we also have a game to play, to pick up back some of the market share we'd like to have in Asia, compared to our competitors. So it's a mix of both things that are going on the ground and our results actually are benefiting from both substantially in Asia. \nNow CUP. CUP is a very interesting circumstance. CUP as you know, domestically in China has a State-mandated position that is very calendar rules and construct. And that's a play that global companies like us cannot play in the domestic processing business. So what we are focused on, on the other hand, is the increasing capability of affluent and middle class Chinese to be spending money outside of China, and of course, more inward travel into China of Mastercard holders like ourselves and that's where our entire arrangement with CUP is constructed. It's constructed on improving MasterCard acceptance in China for people like you and me. It's constructed on improving CUP acceptance outside of China both physically and e-commerce space and but in return for revenue in both these examples. So we make some money by facilitating that acceptance. They make some money by facilitating our acceptance but at all cross-border. Domestically as of now, it's still a very close marketplace that's something that I have no idea when it'll change. I don't know what I could tell you about that portion. I'm just focused on the nondomestic portion of our relationship with CUP.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Bruce Harting with Barclays Capital.\nBruce Harting - Barclays Capital\nJust trying to reconcile your terrific volume number printed here and given by Martina through July even with adjustments for acquisitions in SunTrust, et cetera. With the doom and gloom out there, in terms of an emerging recession possibly here and all the problems we read about daily, in Europe, can you get a little more granular with any geographies or maybe give examples, particular strength in Europe, I mean the numbers you're putting up in Europe defy what we read about everyday there. Asia, the numbers the APMEA numbers, I mean, it looks like back in the envelop in a couple of years, those numbers could be as strong as the U.S. in terms of volumes. \nIs this mostly your war on cash playing out or is this PCE rising in these countries or both? I'm just trying to get a little bit, is the market maybe your opinion on what you're seeing from the bottoms up here, is the market overly pessimistic or is this just the shift to digital payments? And I think the answer is important for your stock could be one of the best to hold if we are going into a recession, if the answer is the war on cash because you'll sustain these growth rates even through the downturn?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nBruce, it's Martina. Really all of the factors that are impacting our growth, you have just quoted, so let me talk a little bit about it. The United States is a bit different than the rest of the world. So let me start with the rest of the world first. When you look at Asia Pacific and in Latin America, as Ajay has already said, there is a significant secular trend going on in terms of people using less and less cash and check in those countries where you have checks, a more electronic forms of payment. \nIn addition to that, all the work that our people are actually doing on the ground, in terms of winning business in helping financial institutions, as well as a number of other companies, as well as governments around the world to be converting really taking advantage of the secular opportunity that is benefiting really our growth. In Europe, you have some of the same going on. There obviously also market share gains impacting in there, but the Europeans are very interesting. You hear in the United States, you hear a lot of doom and gloom when when you go into Europe, you don't hear quite as much doom and gloom. In fact, when you talk to a lot of Europeans and it is August today, they will be all going on vacation still and they might be doing vacation in a little bit of a different way than they have been doing in the past but they're still will be going for 2 or 3 or 4 weeks at times on vacation. \nSo people will be still continuing to spend and because of the secular trend and because our product being readily available in the market, we will obviously benefit from that. United States is a little bit different. When you really look at the underlying growth rate, I already said in my remarks that gas prices, this contributes a couple of percentage points. I mean, when you just look at gas prices alone right there, they increase by a $1 per gallon from the year-ago quarter. So that has a significant impact on the volume growth. Transactions, by the way, haven't changed too much when you just look at the gas portion. In addition to that, you see a number of other commodities actually having increased price, okay. So look at food and what all goes into the food. Look at the energy prices, look at the gold prices that go into luxury product, for instance. So a number of the drivers are really impacted by what's going on from an inflation point of view. And then last, but not least, Ajay already told a story about we have 2 types of consumers in the United States. We have those people who have a job who feel that they will have that job for quite some while to come, who feel that they can go out and do the spending that they need to do and then on the other hand, you have the consumer who is not quite as well off, who is not able to do it like that. So I hope that gives you a little bit more of a clarification where we are.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.\nChris, I realized that it's a strategy that's still evolving and you've made some specific comments vis-\u00e0-vis your PIN debit share and desire, I guess, directionally to take share. Can you just talk a little bit philosophically about your willingness to go after routing volume, both in terms of kind of the pricing initiatives you might be willing to take opportunistically as you mention, but also the economics and the ROI considerations? I mean, Martina mentioned that PIN debit economics weren't so hot to begin with, I imagine it'll only get worse post-Durbin. Maybe just a little thought on the puts and takes and MasterCard's willingness to be aggressive versus just sit back and let volume flow your way?\nChris McWilton\nYes. I think I mentioned in my comments that the PIN debit economics are very thin, pre-Durbin. I think in terms of a couple of cents of transaction, that's sort of a zip code size of revenue yield off these transactions. So you start taking that pre-Durbin and then you start thinking about how much do we pay large merchants to route, how should we pay acquirers to route, and how much do we pay issuers to position ourselves in an optimal space with their routing configuration on the back of their card. It doesn't leave a lot of money left over. So because of that, we're not going at this with a blanket approach to pricing. We, as I mentioned earlier, I think Tien-Tsin asked the question, much more surgical, much more precise in terms of where we think we can play in this space. You have to remember that PIN debit transactions are very inexpensive to start with. They're single message transactions. There are a multitude of PIN networks out there in addition to MasterCard and our big competitor. There are a number of regional PIN networks out there which makes it very competitive. There's a lot of capacity on PIN networks today. So the volume increase that we will see or anybody will see with PIN debit changes will far exceed the revenue implications of that going forward. That's just the way it is and that's why I've said, we are not in the game to go out and buy every PIN transaction we can. We're going to do this in a way that optimizes our economics.\nAndrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.\nIs there consideration to just say, hey, we don't want to be in the business or it's not,  could the economics don't justify your being here?\nChris McWilton\nNo. We absolutely want this business but we want in a thoughtful way, want in a way that makes economic sense to us. But we have a great network, we have global acceptance. We'd like to see transactions across our network. It gives us information capability that we otherwise wouldn't have. But we're not going to do it in a way that just doesn't make economic sense.\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nlet me just add to this. Our network is really scalable, right. And we are able to add additional transactions at a very low incremental costs. So from a positioning point of view, from a cost structure point of view, we are obviously in a very good position to be able to pick up deals in a selective manner. But because of all of the things that has to still shake out in the market between the issuers, the acquirers and the merchants, we said that we do believe that there will be opportunity, we're not sure yet how much opportunity. So for us it is really a way of how are we going to go after profitable growth. And then how much are we really going to get that?\nAjay Banga\nThis is Ajay. And let me tell you that I think part of the confusion that comes in this topic comes from the use of the word economics. When we say economics are thin, what we mean is that revenue economics of a PIN debit transaction, not the profitability economics of a PIN debit transaction. Not the operating margin economics of a PIN debit transaction. So when Chris is talking about revenue, it's crystal clear that it's PIN. That's why he says you may get more volume growth than revenue percentage growth. Yet as he said in his remarks and Martina just said, the cost of processing most transactions incrementally at the margin is very small for our company. So we still think there's enough business there to not only make decent operating margin from if he's in those deals, but also use that incremental data that we get, the incremental transactions that we see to add value to many other products we sell, whether it be inControl, whether it be sort of the express monitoring services or risk, so there's all things that we do with that data. So you've got to just understand that logic of revenue economics versus operating margin economics.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jim Kissane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJames Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch\nJust a clarification, Martina, what portion of your U.S. volume is from gas? And then a question for Chris, you kind of alluded to the Fed re-evaluating interchange cap, would you have a sense in terms of how often they'll review debit issuer cost and ultimately the interchange cap?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nJim, it's a relatively small portion, obviously, of overall volume. The only thing that we did see in the quarter ticking up and that's totally in keeping with the price change is, actually, is now from 7.5%, we usually said that the volume is gas as part of volume 7.5% is now a little bit over 9%. And then from a transaction point of view though, we're seeing that it doesn't change much. It's around just shy of 16%, 15.8% I think for the quarter.\nChris McWilton\nAnd with respect to the Fed reviewing interchange caps, our indication is it could be every 2 years, or thereabouts. So that's the time horizon you should be thinking through.\nOperator\nYour final question today comes from the line of Tom McCrohan with Janney Capital Markets.\nThomas McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\nI was just wondering if MasterCard had a view on allowing bill payments on prepaid cards in light of the new language that prohibits access to funds loaded on GPR cards over the bank on a CA system, and if you can just clarify, did I hear you say that you have a new GPR card that you distribute to Walmart? Can you just clarify that?\nChris McWilton\nWith respect to allowing bill pay on the card, that's really the issuers' decision, what they allow the functionality of the card, what are these allowed to do, whether ATM withdrawal, bill pay, direct access to DD&A accounts, whatever the case might be or to fund it. So it's not whether we allow it or not allow it, it's whether once the issuer decided to provide that functionality, whether it qualifies or regulated or unregulated rates. The Walmart program, these were general-purpose reloadable cards, put into the stores at their new financial centers, which you'll see some press around to enable their customers to avail themselves to prepay functionality. And as you know, all their associates in the United States received their payroll on a prepaid card, if they did not have a bank account. So we've had some good traction with that major retailer in the prepaid space.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn it back over to Ajay Banga for closing remarks.\nAjay Banga\nThank you. Let me just leave you with a few closing thoughts. We have delivered really good results for the first half of 2011, due not only to the strength in our base business across all 5 of our regions, but also driven by volume and transactions from new deals. Chris spent some time talking about the U.S. Debit. In a date a year or so before this plays out across all the stakeholders, we remain confident we can increase our share in the U.S. Debit category. \nWe will maneuver to drive the maximum positive impact for MasterCard. Thinking about the business going forward, as I told you, there is economic uncertainty, particularly in the United States and Europe that we need to keep a close eye on. At this point, growth remains relatively strong in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa. \nThrough all this, we have not lost sight of the big picture. We remain focused on displacing the 85% of transactions across the globe that are conducted using cash and checks. That is our opportunity. We are executing on our growth strategy to invest in differentiated capabilities and win more than our fair share of this secular shift to electronic payments. With that, we're going to conclude the call. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.\n\n",

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nCathy Creswell\nThank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s third quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our third quarter earnings release and filed our Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents, as well as our supplemental financial information package, are available on our website, www.vno.com under the Investor Relations section. In these documents and during today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-Q and financial supplement. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form10-K, for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. The call may include time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today\u2019s date. The company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nOn the call today from management for our opening comments are: Michael Fascitelli, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Greenbaum, President of the New York Division; Mitchell Schear, President of the Washington DC Division; and Joseph MacNow, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Steven Roth, Chairman of the Board will be present for the duration of the call.\nI will now turn the call over to Michael Fascitelli.\nMichael Fascitelli\nThanks, Cathy. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We are happy you are all joining us today and appreciate your time and attention. After my opening remarks, David Greenbaum will talk about our New York business and Mitchell Schear will talk about our Washington business, followed by Joe MacNow who will provide a financial overview of the quarter and then we\u2019ll answer your questions. We will end at 11 o\u2019clock.\nBefore getting started, I would like to acknowledge the devastation the Northeast suffered from Hurricane Sandy. This tragedy which cost over 100 lives thus far and tens of billions of property damage affected our home base in New York and Washington, particularly in New York, which was hardest hit. I\u2019m pleased to report that we suffered no personal injuries and only minor property damage. I want to thank all of our people for the incredible job they did and express our best wishes to all those affected by the hurricane as they recover.\nDavid and Mitchell will comment further, particularly David, on the specifics for their businesses. Overall, I\u2019m quite satisfied with our third quarter results, which were $0.01 better than last year\u2019s third quarter. In spite of the downward pressure coming from BRAC in Washington DC, an old story, it\u2019s interesting to note that if Washington would have been leveled this year to last, we would have had comparable FFO performance over the prior year\u2019s quarter of 7%.\nThe Washington office market is sluggish and the New York office market, lacking support from the financial service industry, is locked in neutral. However, it is clear from our financial results that our New York portfolio is outperforming the market and our Washington portfolio is outperforming the projections we provided in our public filings. David and Mitchell will expand on this in a few minutes.\nLet me update you on asset sales, part of our program to simplify and to recycle capital into our core portfolio of high quality office and retail assets. In the third quarter, we closed on the previously announced sales of the Washington Design Center, Washington Office Center, the Canadian Tradeshow Business and Dorchester, a non-core strip shopping center. Total proceeds from these sales were $323 million with a third quarter net gain of $149 million.\nImportantly, in the fourth quarter we announced the sale of two malls for $1.25 billion. The Green Acres Mall and Alexander\u2019s King Plaza Mall which were both sold to the Macerich Company. When completed, these transactions will produce substantial proceeds and gains and Joe will provide further detail in a few minutes on the specifics of these gains and distributions. We also announced the sale of Reston Executive, a three building suburban office complex in Fairfax County, Virginia for $126 million resulting in a net gain of $35 million. We sold the building on Market Street in Philadelphia which is part of the Gallery at Market East for $60 million resulting in a gain of $35 million. We expect to close both these deals in the fourth quarter.\nIn addition, we expect to close in the fourth quarter the previously announced sale of the Boston Design Center for approximately $72 million. Lastly, we sold our equity investment in Brewery to Brookfield Asset Management for $28 million. We will continue to hold $25 million of Brewery 4.75% 2018 debentures.\nIn summary, this year, we produced $2.3 billion of asset sales with a net gain of $674 million and expect to pay a special long-term capital gain dividend of $202 million or $1.02 per share for Vornado\u2019s share of King\u2019s Plaza. We intend to do a tax deferred lifetime exchange with the sale proceeds of Green Acres and others. We will continue to dispose of non-core assets. We just acquired a 25% participation in a $475 million first mortgage and mezzanine loans on 701 Seventh Avenue, a retail redevelopment property in Times Square where we already have two dominant properties in that market.\nThe yield today is 11%, which will increase after selling off our senior position. We will continue to invest in our existing assets and development opportunities. Given the current environment, our strategy for acquisition will be measured and focused on continuing to expand our leading New York City street retail platform and upgrading our high quality office property for our platform.\nLet me now turn the call over to David to discuss the New York business.\nDavid Greenbaum\nThanks you, Michael, and good morning to all. Before I turn to the results for the quarter, I do want to spend a minute talking about what we\u2019ve been going through here at New York City over the past several days. We have contingency plans for almost all occurrences and last Friday, as we began to receive dire warnings, we implemented our emergency management procedures coordinating all of our personnel to have round-the-clock coverage in all of our buildings.\nOur engineers, porters, security guards and property management professionals, all were hunkered down during the storm. Some of them still today in buildings, which are dark, literally living in the buildings, sleeping in shifts on cots. I\u2019m enormously proud of our team for securing all of our buildings during the storm, and for communicating on a real-time basis updates to all of our tenants.\nMost of our buildings did not lose power and have remained open throughout. Other than one small building directly in one of the flood zones downtown, which will take about a week to bring back, all of the buildings that lost power should be up and running as soon as Con Edison completes the repairs to its network, which we hope will take place this weekend.\nNow, let me turn to the quarter, while the overall market in New York is tepid, we\u2019ve had a strong quarter. We leased over 500,000 square feet of office space in the third quarter, which took our office occupancy up 50 basis points to 95.8%. The highlights of our leasing activity this quarter are two headquarters consolidation deals, one in financial services and one in advertising.\nAt 350 Park, we leased 103,000 square feet to M&T Bank in a renewal and expansion transaction, which allowed M&T to consolidate its Wilmington Trust division, which it recently acquired into 350 Park Avenue. To produce the expansion space for M&T in this complicated deal, we terminated two leases early and also renegotiated two other leases.\nAt 909 Third Avenue, we leased 220,000 square feet to IPG, The Interpublic Group, which allowed IPG to consolidate offices from four different locations into our building. For IPG, we created a headquarters environment including dedicated lobby space and elevators, branding and a great outdoor terrace space.\nTo make this deal, we leveraged our existing relationship with IPG, which is also our lead tenant at 100 West 33rd Street where IPG occupies over 400,000 square feet. These two large transactions plus another 22 leases signed in the quarter had an average starting rent of $58.74 per square foot with a positive mark-to-market of 8.9% cash and 5% GAAP. Many of the flash analyst reports, which I read last night, commented on our CapEx. Our average TIs were elevated this quarter at $56.92 per square foot. That\u2019s because 75% of this quarter\u2019s leasing activity was new and expansion deals versus 30%, which was the case in the first half of the year.\nOur year-to-date office leasing activity is a robust 1.5 million square feet, which includes some 620,000 square feet of leasing in our Penn Plaza office portfolio. The Midtown South submarket with its tight availability has been expanding to include Penn Plaza. In fact, Penn Plaza recently was reported to have the lowest Class A vacancy rate in Midtown at sub 5%. This has allowed us to begin to push Penn Plaza office rents and at One Penn Plaza, we recently have completed several deals over $60 per square foot.\nFor our entire 19.6 million office portfolio, we have a relatively modest amount of upcoming lease expirations with 156,000 square feet expiring in the balance of this year and 673,000 square feet expiring in 2013. This amount of upcoming expirations has been substantially reduced as a result of our aggressive forward leasing over the last several quarters. Let me now spend a minute talking about some market dynamics. Since last summer, the market effectively has been at equilibrium with the Manhattan vacancy rate hovering just under 10%.\nOur occupancy, at 95.8%, continues to outperform the market as we do quarter in and quarter out. Renewals this year have made up the bulk of the transactions in the market enabling tenants to avoid capital expenditures. In fact, in Midtown, there\u2019ve only been three major relocation deals year-to-date over 100,000 square feet, the IPG lease, I mentioned earlier, is one of those three deals.\nUncertainty in the regulatory environment has also led the financial institutions to remain on the sidelines. However, our diversified portfolio of over 1,200 tenants is not reliant on any one industry. Take a look at the list of the major tenants in our New York segment property table in the financial supplement, and you\u2019ll see what I mean.\nIn years past, view space in the tower of the building was the first to go. With affordability being the theme of today, that trend seems to have reversed somewhat as tenants are focusing on the base of buildings, both for the value prospect and the flexibility larger floor plates provide for open space planning. This bodes well for the releasing of the former Citibank space at 666 Fifth Avenue. While you likely have read that Citi has moved out of the space, we will continue to receive rent through the lease expiration, two years hence, giving us considerable time to release the space.\nRegarding trophy space, which includes our buildings at 640 Fifth Avenue, 888 Seventh Avenue, 280 Park Avenue, and 350 Park Avenue, while the market is not yet back to the premium seen before the financial crisis, there have been 27 transactions over $100 per square foot year-to-date. I\u2019m pleased to say that three of those $100 plus deals have been in our own portfolio, and we have two more in the hopper.\nWe have a long track record of transforming buildings to create value, having done it time and again, 770 Broadway, 1740 Broadway, 640 Fifth Avenue and 888 Seventh Avenue to just name a few. Earlier this year, we completed the total redevelopment of our 330 Madison Avenue property capped by over 400,000 square feet of leasing activity including headquarters transactions with Guggenheim Partners and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nAt 280 Park Avenue, the transformation is now underway with our joint venture partner, SL Green. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, the building will feature a new double height lobby spanning the entire Park Avenue block front and a winter garden interconnecting both buildings surrounded by new plazas. The receptivity to the overall redevelopment plan from the brokerage and tenant communities has been very positive. And while we are fielding lease increase, our experience from the many buildings we have redeveloped is that while the renderings are great, what the tenant community and brokers really appreciate is the quality of the redevelopment when they start to see it completed.\nWe have one other major transformation well underway at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, where we are dramatically upgrading the scale and character of the lobby, store front and elevators to match the stature of this two plus million square foot corporate headquarters building. This project is currently under construction with completion scheduled for the first quarter of 2013. The change already is dramatic. I\u2019d encourage you to go take a look.\nTurning now to our Manhattan street retail portfolio, where we own the dominant 2.3 million square foot retail platform. We leased 183,000 square feet of retail space year-to-date with positive mark-to-markets of 19.4% cash and 27.2% GAAP. The retail market is very strong, driven by the continued growth in tourism which is expected to reach 52 million visitors this year. New York continues to be the gateway market for global retailers including, for example, Massimo Dutti, one of Zara\u2019s brands, which opened its first store in the United States at our 689 Fifth Avenue property last month.\nRetail rents are now well above their all-time highs approaching $3,000 per square foot on Fifth Avenue and $2,000 per square foot in Times Square. In Times Square, last week Microsoft opened a pop-up store at our 1540 Broadway property for the global launch of its new Surface, tablet computer. Sales here have exceeded Microsoft\u2019s expectations, which again demonstrate the strength of the Times Square market. Both Massimo Dutti and Microsoft deals speak to the exceptional quality of our Manhattan street retail portfolio.\nWe continue to have great growth prospects in this portfolio of extremely well located assets with in- place rents averaging 30% under market, and by the way, many individual assets are multiples of that. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about the prospects for the development of the full block front of retail signage at Marriott Marquis, which is directly across from 1540 Broadway, the two best sites by far in Times Square.\nThe entire New York division, which is a total of 25.5 million square feet, we had a good quarter with positive same-store of 0.7% cash and 0.3% GAAP. If you exclude the Hotel Penn, which was weak this quarter along with the rest of the New York hotel market, the same-store increase is positive 1.9% cash and 1.3% GAAP. Now let me turn it back over to Mike.\nMichael Fascitelli\nThanks, David. Let me turn it over to Mitchell Schear to discuss our Washington business.\nMitchell Schear\nThanks, Mike, and good morning to everybody. While we in Washington, largely dodged Sandy, I have an incredibly competent team on the ground that was fully prepared for the worst. Our colleagues in New York bore the brunt of it, and really did a yeoman\u2019s job during this crisis. As you may know, our Washington portfolio is approximately 20 million square feet, concentrated in Washington DC and Arlington, Virginia, directly across the Potomac River in Crystal City, Pentagon City and Rosslyn.\nOur footprint is about twice the size of any of our peers. I want to start by contextualizing the Washington Metro market in general. Currently, market demand is soft, but not as soft as many believe as tenants await election results and clarity of the budget crisis. There is leasing activity in the market. In 2012, the gross leasing activity is expected to be about 32 million square feet, which is actually on par with the 15-year average.\nThere is a lot of churn, but not yet enough absorption to eat into vacancies, especially in this peak BRAC year. Through three quarters of the year, there was negative absorption of about 2.5 million square feet in the market. Rents are holding steady, but concessions are up to attract tenants. Limited supply over the next several years will help to stabilize the market, but we don\u2019t really expect the market to gain significant traction until 2014.\nWithin our Washington portfolio, our year-to-date leasing velocity has been brisk, over 1.6 million square feet so far, well ahead of our projection for the full year. We are attracting good activity and consistently executing more than our fair share of deals at good rents. In fact, we have signed six new leases, each one of them over 50,000 square feet, as compared to one new lease over 25,000 square feet in all of 2011.\nIn the third quarter, specifically, we leased 435,000 square feet at very good average initial rents of $44.02 per square foot and this is versus 389,000 square feet leased in the same quarter last year. The GAAP mark-to-market was 13.8% and the cash mark-to-market was 8.9%. Of the total 435,000 square feet leased this quarter, government leases accounted for 170,000 square feet and the private sector leased 265,000 square feet. So despite a slow leasing environment in Washington, we continue to win business.\nTo start off the fourth quarter, we just executed a lease for 108,000 square feet to the Corporate Executive Board in one of our buildings that is about to be renovated in Rosslyn. With this lease, we have now resolved 871,000 square feet or roughly 36% of the 2.4 million square feet of Department of Defense lease expirations resulting from BRAC. This includes our plan to demolish the existing 350,000 square foot, 1851 South Bell building to rebuild a new state-of-the-art 700,000 square foot office tower at 1900 Crystal Drive. We received final and full approvals from Arlington County for this project in September.\nAlmost all of the BRAC relocations have now taken place and we\u2019re looking ahead. In our 20 million square foot portfolio lease expirations in 2013 are below our average with a very manageable 940,000 square feet expiry. Re-leasing the remainder of the BRAC space is a function of time and we will emerge stronger when completes.\nWe had a similar experience in 2004 and 2005 when the Patent and Trademark Office relocated. But, in the end, we benefited by re-leasing to a more diverse population of tenants and by increasing rents by over 30%. We are confident the same will be true this time, too. For the entire Washington DC division, same-store EBITDA for the quarter was down 6.9% on a GAAP basis and 9.2% on a cash basis due to BRAC.\nOverall occupancy is 84%. Our residential portfolio, which consists of 2,424 units in Arlington and DC representing approximately 12% of the business is over 97% occupied and had a quarterly same-store EBITDA increase of 8.5%. And finally, we are delighted to welcome Nike to Georgetown with the opening last week of their new flagship 31,000 square foot store at our 3040 M Street property.\nNow, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Mike. Thank you.\nMichael Fascitelli\nThanks, Mitchell. I wanted to cover a few things of retail, non- New York City retail and talk a minute about sustainability. Our retail strips and mall team continue to perform. In the quarter, we had an 8.8% GAAP mark-to-market and our occupancy was 93.4%. While the shake outs in the supermarket industry in the closings and downsizings associated with Best Buy and others are a concern, this nationwide trend is less important to us because of the concentration of assets we have in the densely populated high-barrier to entry affluent tri-state area.\nOur mall segment is much smaller and leaner now and the numbers show it. Occupancy is up11.6% to 94.2%. As a result of the Motorola Mobility Google lease and the EBITDA improved by $1.1 million to $13.7 million. The commitment of Motorola Mobility Google at the Merchandise Mart is having the positive ripple effect we thought it would have. We also benefited from restacking the showroom tenants in the building in a very efficient way.\nLet\u2019s talk sustainability for a minute. We\u2019ve been working very hard on this front. Our commitment to sustainability is highlighted in our annual sustainability report available on our website and reprinted in Steve\u2019s Chairman letter. We think sustainability is not only good business and it\u2019s morally responsible and works to increase our profits in the end. Most recently, we are proud that we ranked number one in (inaudible) of our entire industry. And we were 87th among America\u2019s 500 largest publicly-traded companies and 500 largest companies internationally, that\u2019s quite an achievement.\nBy the end of 2012, we will have at least identified over 30 million feet in our portfolio, more than any other single owner nationwide. We are a leader in energy management and sub-metering and our efforts have resulted in significant reduction in energy consumption throughout our portfolio.\nIn summary, we are very excited about the future of our great assets and businesses, which are run by a very talented management team. We will continue to make Vornado, a simpler company and improve the portfolio and recycle capital and increase asset quality.\nI\u2019d like to turn it over to Joe MacNow for the financial review.\nJoe MacNow\nThank you, Michael. Yesterday, we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.14 per share versus $1.13 per share in the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Total funds from operations was $1.34 per share versus $1.05 per share in the prior year\u2019s third quarter.\nFirst Call was $1.17 per share, as some analysts factor in non-comparable items into their estimates and others do not. Our non-comparable items in this quarter consisted of a $19.7 million after-tax gain on the sale of the Canadian Tradeshows, $12.5 million of FFO from discontinued operations and a $11.7 million gain on redemption of preferred units, $4.3 million of income from the mark-to-market of the JCPenney derivative position, partially offset by a $7 million Veridien impairment and other costs.\nAs Mike indicated, we announced the sale of the Green Acres Mall for $500 million to the Macerich Company. Net proceeds from this sale will be $185 million after repaying the existing loan and closing costs. The gain for financial statement purposes will be approximately $195 million. The tax gain will be approximately $304 million and is expected to be deferred as part of a like kind exchange.\nThe Green Acres sale is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2013, and is conditioned on the closing of the Kings Plaza Mall. Alexander\u2019s, our 32.4% owned affiliate, also announced the sale of Kings Plaza Mall for $751 million to Macerich. Net proceeds to Alexander\u2019s from this sale will be $481 million after repaying the existing loan and closing costs.\nAlexander\u2019s gain for financial statement purposes will be approximately $603 million of which Vornado\u2019s 32.4% share will be approximately $181 million after adjusting for certain acquisition costs in Alexander\u2019s stock. Alexander\u2019s tax gain will be approximately $625 million, which is expected to be paid out to shareholders as a special long-term capital gain dividend this year. Vornado\u2019s share of the dividend is approximately $202 million or $1.02 per Vornado share, and is also expected to be paid out this year to Vornado shareholders as a special long-term capital gain dividend. The Kings Plaza sale is expected to be completed this quarter.\nWe have over $2.7 billion in liquidity at September 30. Our consolidated debt to enterprise value is 36.8%, and our consolidated debt to EBITDA is 6.6 times. In capital market transactions this quarter, we issued $300 million of 5.7% preferred shares and redeemed $255 million of preferred shares and preferred units with a weighted average dividend cost of 6.9%. This results in $3.1 million lower annual dividend costs to us and the $11.7 million gain in non-comparable items I just mentioned.\nWe refinanced two properties for aggregate proceeds of $248 million with a weighted average term of 10 years, which resulted in $49 million of net proceeds. The weighted average interest rate of the new loans is 3.3% compared to 2.3% weighted average interest rate on the maturing loans. That is a result of going from floating rate to fixed rate on one of those loans in the amount of $150 million. Now, the new loan has a 12 year term fixed rate.\nWe also unencumbered two properties by repaying $151 million outstanding balance on the mortgage loans, which had a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. Of course, the source of that was our overnight cash balances which are at zero.\nImportantly, we expect to complete the refinancing of 1290 Avenue of the Americas in the fourth quarter in a single asset CMBS for close to $1 billion replacing the $409 million mortgage that now exists on the property and with a much lower interest rate. We also expect to finance the acquisition of 666 Fifth Avenue retail with a $390 million mortgage. We are highly confident that the $721 million of remaining 2013 maturities will be refinanced at favorable rates as well.\nAt this time, I\u2019d like to turn it over for Q&A.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\n\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from George Auerbach of ISI Group. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group\nGreat. Thanks very much. Mitchell, with the BRAC moved outs largely behind you and the DC portfolio around 81% leased on the office side, how should we think about the timelines against that portfolio back to kind of the 90% occupied range, is that sort of a three to four year target or should we expect a bit of a longer lease up given some of the uncertainties you see?\nMichael Fascitelli\nOh, even with my hearing aid, I have trouble hearing you. Can you talk a little louder?\nGeorge Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group\nYeah, sorry about that. Just asking Mitchell about the DC occupancy levels, clearly you\u2019re sort of at a bottom now with the BRAC moveouts behind you, how should we think about getting the portfolio back to 90% occupancy, is that sort of a three to four year timeline or should that be a bit longer given the uncertainty in DC?\nMitchell Schear\nAs I said earlier, I think that our expectations for 2013 are relatively modest, and we expect to see traction in the marketplace starting in 2014. So, I would say that we\u2019re looking at a couple of year period once we get into 2014 to really regain closer to our stabilized occupancies.\nGeorge Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group\nThanks, and Mike, you\u2019ve had a successful year selling assets in 2012, I guess thinking about 2013, how do you see the pipeline of sales? How should we think about the level of potential proceeds and what would you put at the top of the list of your wish to sell list?\nMichael Fascitelli\nWell. I think, George, we\u2019re going to continue to sell assets as we move into 2013, there\u2019s still a considerable amount of assets that we\u2019re \u2013 we want to sell and we will sell for over a period of time. I don\u2019t want to specify exactly the order in which assets are going to be handled, but I think we\u2019ll continue to do in a very measured and orderly way. And we will then look at each asset as we did in the case of Kings Plaza, we distributed that money, and here at Green Acres we\u2019re doing a like kind exchange depending on its tax and its basis, how to handle that.\nThe acquisition market is a competitive market. And we only are going to buy assets there where we think we\u2019re getting very good long-term rate of return on an adjusted basis that meets our hurdle rate. So, it\u2019s a process which I think we did a very good job so far and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. And as we do that, we\u2019ll obviously update you on the specifics in the quarterly calls and obviously in our filings. I will say this that we do have a very great effort that every asset that we sell, obviously improves the quality of the portfolio of anything that we would buy. So, that is one of the recycling themes that we will continue to emphasize.\nCathy Creswell\nNext question?\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bilerman \u2013 Citi\nYeah. Good morning. Just sticking with the point, Mike, is there anything keyed up today, obviously the malls went through a big process and had unbelievable execution on those sales, so I\u2019m just curious as we think about the more near-term next few quarters, is there anything sort of actively being marketed for sale and just that we understand the magnitude of potential near-term dispositions?\nMichael Fascitelli\nThanks, Michael. I think \u2013 I take it that you like the execution on that by that question, so thank you. I think that we have \u2013 The Plant still on the market for sale, and obviously, we have several other assets right behind that that are coming to the market for totaling approximately $400 million to $500 million, and we\u2019ll continue to do that as we go through the fourth quarter, and obviously into next year, these deals won\u2019t close in the fourth quarter, of course. So, and then each asset just like we sold the asset in Philadelphia, which was not core and we will continue to sell assets here and there that we think don\u2019t fit the geographies, that don\u2019t fit the profile that we want to go forward to it.\nSo, it\u2019s a process that we will generate a considerable amount further proceeds from, but I don\u2019t \u2013 Michael, I think as we go through, those are the two most immediate ones that we have on the market.\nMichael Bilerman \u2013 Citi\nAnd then just you said Steve was there, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s taking questions, but I had a follow-up just for Steve, in terms of the rezoning on the East Side it was something Steve that you had talked about two letters ago. Obviously there has been some progress on that front, I\u2019m just curious your take on where things stand today and what Vornado\u2019s key opportunities would be in that potential rezoning?\nSteve Roth\nHi Michael, obviously since I initiated the idea several years ago and reiterated it in the second letter, we think it\u2019s a good idea. We think it\u2019s extremely important just to focus for a moment on Park Avenue, which I guess we in New York consider to be the number one corporate thoroughfare in the world actually, that it has the kind of economic incentives that developers need to tear down obsolete buildings and build new buildings. So, we\u2019re very \u2013 actually we\u2019re very pleased that the powers that be are working on it. The Bloomberg Administration is in its twilight years, they\u2019re trying to rush a plan through and we hope they succeed and we think it will be good for New York.\nMichael Bilerman \u2013 Citi\nThank you.\nMichael Fascitelli\nNext question?\nOperator\nOur next question is from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone \u2013 JP Morgan\nThank you. Good morning. Last quarter you said New York City rents were rising modestly and so I was just wondering if financial services kind of stays in this bit of a respite state, do you think there\u2019s the risk that as Lower Manhattan product comes online next year, we can take a step backwards or do you think there\u2019s enough absorption in other industries to kind of keep that modest growth going?\nMichael Fascitelli\nI\u2019ll let David take a shot at that one.\nDavid Greenbaum\nI think generally what we\u2019re seeing in the market is basic equilibrium. The expectation is that the actual availability/vacancy rate Downtown as some of the new product, the World Trade Center and some of the buildings where tenants will be relocating Downtown to Midtown that we\u2019re going to be seeing some much higher vacancy rates Downtown. I think generally though what we\u2019re seeing still to date is continuing job growth in New York.\nYear-to-date, we\u2019ve had about 30,000 \u2013 40,000, I think the number is about 43,000 office sector jobs, actually met just yesterday with one of the brokerage houses and their Chief Economist and the projections for 2013 are continuing job growth with actually acceleration as we get into 2014 \u2013 2015. So, I think next year is going to be relatively flat, I think as we get out to 2014 and 2015, I feel better about some growth in rents.\nAnthony Paolone \u2013 JP Morgan\nOkay. And then just another question, maybe this is for Joe, as you guys pass special here, sell some retail which generally tends to have less CapEx than say office. How should we think about the dividend and AFFO or FAD on a go-forward basis as you get some pressure from those things perhaps and also you\u2019ll have the \u2013 in the next few years some lease up of DC, which will probably bump up CapEx, I\u2019d imagine?\nJoe MacNow\nNo, fortunately some of that asset disposition, lack of FFO and taxable income going forward is offset by growth in our other businesses. So, the board tries to get the dividend to be somewhere close to recurring taxable income and I think that will continue and I don\u2019t think there is much upward pressure on a taxable income in 2013, but there is certainly no downward pressure on it either.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nGreat, thank you. Good morning. I\u2019m hoping you guys can talk a little bit more about your latest thoughts on JCPenney kind of where do you think we are in the restructuring plan and what\u2019s your appetite for investment going forward?\nSteve Roth\nThis is Steve. Everybody is looking at me for that answer. So, Jamie, hi, first of all, we remain committed to the investment. JCPenney will report their quarter a week from today, next Friday. Management is executing a plan of enormous change on that business, enormous change. This year, which is the transition year, is a difficult year. It\u2019s actually no secret that it\u2019s proving out to be more difficult than the management team thought. The second year, the recycle that begins in 90 days on February 1, 2013. We remain committed to the investment. We believe that the transformation of the \u2013 and the creation of a unique retailer and what Rod Johnson calls a specialty department store has the prospects of being enormously successful. This is a tough period. We understand that, but we remain committed to the investment. Thanks.\nJamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nSo are there certain benchmarks that are kind of goals that you want to see hit by in a certain amount of time? Like how do you judge when it\u2019s time to get out?\nSteve Roth\nI really can\u2019t answer that question. Obviously, the business is complicated. Obviously, we monitor the performance very carefully. I and other large investments are on the board there. And I really can\u2019t say anything more about that, Jamie.\nJamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nAll right. Thank you.\nSteve Roth\nThank you.\nMichael Fascitelli\nNext question?\nOperator\nOur next question is from Chris Caton of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nChris Caton \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nDavid, thanks for your commentary on New York. I was hoping you could revisit the retail. You mentioned rents I think are at peak levels, can you talk about that dynamic a bit? How have they trended over the past year or two, and to what extent has that been driven by the strength in retail sales and to what extent is that a desire by retailers to have a flagship store and accept a higher occupancy cost? Do you think the rents can continue to experience outsized growth?\nDavid Greenbaum\nI think the three markets where we\u2019ve really seen some significant growth in rents over the last year plus are on Fifth Avenue and Fifth Avenue effectively really is two segments from about 51st Street North and South 51st to 42nd Street, Madison Avenue and then Times Square, of course. We\u2019ve probably seen the single largest increase in rents on Fifth Avenue in the quarter from 42nd to 51st Street seeing rents effectively over the last year approximately double to a tad in excess of that.\nAs I said earlier, on Upper Fifth Avenue, we\u2019ve really seen rents approaching $3,000 a foot and that was in fact validated with the deal that we did at 689 Fifth Avenue with MAC earlier this year. And, again on Madison Avenue, we\u2019ve seen extraordinary strengths in the market. We have closed a number of deals at 11 East 68th Street, again at rents at and above $1,000 a foot.\nI think as you look at some of the sales numbers, I guess the comment I\u2019ll make is, Times Square is an extraordinary market because it almost a 24/7 market. As we\u2019ve looked at some of our retailers, some of them have approached sales per square foot of $6,000, $7,000 and $8,000 a foot on some small stores. So, I don\u2019t think these things are just \u201cadvertisements and branding\u201d. I think companies today and especially a number of the fast retailers that do their own production, these stores really are making money for them.\nMichael Fascitelli\nI\u2019d just comment also that SoHo has had a pretty good run in rents, also. In that (inaudible) if you look at retail, as David said in his comments, we have great well-located assets with a lot of rollover that will produce substantial mark-to-market gains.\nAnd even if there\u2019s a pause in these rents at this level, it\u2019s going to be enormous mark-to-market and the demand for these assets are worldwide and the tenants, as David mentioned, and also the shoppers are worldwide, in terms of tourism around the world as well as tourism within the United States. So, we expect these markets to be very good long-term. There won\u2019t be a straight line up, there may be a pause as the market absorbs these new rental levels, but then you see more tenants trying to drive that. So, bullish \u2013 we\u2019re very bullish on this over the long-term.\nChris Caton \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nThanks for that. And then \u2013 and the follow-up is on that mark-to-market. So, as you look at some of the renewals or expirations you get over the next few years, to what extent do you expect the tenants to renew in place and to what extent do you think you need to rebuild out the space?\nMichael Fascitelli\nIt varies by case, I think \u2013 and take 640 Fifth Avenue in which H&M was their original flagship store which have gone up substantially, multiples, they chose to relocated to a cheaper site, and reduce \u2013 and so still have an increase in existing rent, but not the size of that, and we\u2019ll backfill that space with tenants that will generate substantial multiples than what they were paying, but it\u2019s case-by-case. Some tenants will renew, some tenants will downsize and renew, some tenants will seek more value-oriented locations, but it\u2019s hard to make a generalization, but you want the space to be desired by multiple peoples so you could push the rent vis-\u00e0-vis existing tenant or the tenants that might come in to occupy that.\nDavid Greenbaum\nThe only thing \u2013 it\u2019s David, that I might add to that is at 640 with H&M having announced the relocation, it actually is a great opportunity for us, that lease comes up in 2015. We\u2019re out there now marketing the space. We expect actually, if we want we can get our hands on it probably sometime around the middle of next year.\nMichael Fascitelli\nNext question?\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Schaffer \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill\nThank you. It\u2019s actually Andrew Schaffer here. First I just wanted to get some additional color on your investment host and how the 5.2% return was arrived at versus a usual developer 8% plus hurdle?\nJoe MacNow\nHi, Alex. It\u2019s Joe. Well of course you might expect that that was a negotiation and you\u2019re right. There is a lease that gives us effective control over the retail redevelopment at the base and that lease calls for annual payments of $12.5 million a year plus a share of the growth in cash flow that comes from the redevelopment that we do. But, the underlying \u2013 and Marriott has an ability to put it to us after the retailers made a separate condominium from the hotel and we have a right to take it from them in a certain number of years. (Inaudible) Alex were you able to hear that?\nAndrew Schaffer \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill\nI can\u2019t. It\u2019s actually Andrew and I cannot hear that.\nJoe MacNow\nOkay. What Steve said was, that the 5.2% was calculated based upon the existing cash flow. If it was a market price deal, the first digit would\u2019ve been a four or maybe even a three with a high second digit. So, we have a capital lease for $240 million, we have a capital lease liability for the same amount on the balance sheet. The income statement won\u2019t have any effect until it gets out of development and that\u2019s about the summary.\nMichael Fascitelli\nI want to just comment on, I know you guys focus on the going in yields on any of these deals. And it\u2019s not unimportant, but it isn\u2019t how we look at things. We look at the overall return we can create over a period of time. Sometimes we\u2019re buying well below market lease and that would justify a much lower cap rate that we could turn in a period of years into a much higher yield. And we look \u2013 and so the 5.2% doesn\u2019t really relate to the overall cost of capital of 8%. It\u2019s really what the asset can perform and generate over a period of time. So whether it\u2019s the Marriott deal or whether it\u2019s another deal, we look at that over a period of a holding period which could be as long as five to ten years or longer and then that has to meet that \u2013 clear that hurdle of our cost of capital.\nAndrew Schaffer \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill\nThat definitely makes sense. I was just trying to get a better understanding of that negotiation. And secondly, I was just trying to get a better understanding of what it would take in relation to the Kings Plaza sale for you to take or exercise your right to get this $30 million in stock from Macerich and if that\u2019s completely rated for tax purposes?\nMichael Fascitelli\nYes. Yes.\nAndrew Schaffer \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill\nOkay, that was simple. All right, thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you. We have five minutes left in this call. And we\u2019ll take one more question. The next question is from Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.\nMichael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors\nHi, everybody. Hey, Mike I assume it\u2019s fair to say that, that Vornado expects to remain a net seller next year. But on the investment side of the coin, just curious where you may see the best opportunities today?\nMichael Fascitelli\nI\u2019m not going to speculate. We\u2019re certainly going to sell assets. If we found great acquisitions, we would certainly proceed with those. We\u2019ve been focusing on the core markets that we\u2019re in, we\u2019re focusing on the street retail in New York, as David mentioned before, particularly for value-added opportunities that may come with some releasing down the road or redevelopment down the road. Nyack is a good example of that, David, there\u2019s a process to go through, adding additional space, really working that asset over a period of time, to try to pay, as Joe mentioned, a $5.2 existing income going substantially up.\nSo, street retail in New York with value-added components is particularly a focus. We\u2019re looking at a lot of office buildings, I think there\u2019s an escalating volume of office deals coming to the market as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year. Bigger deals that might provide some opportunity. Obviously, if there\u2019s a lease rollover in some of those that will take place down the road, that could affect the \u2013 obviously pricing could affect the return potential.\nSo \u2013 and in DC, we haven\u2019t seen much distress in asset sales, despite what a negatively viewed market. If we saw a break here \u2013 we\u2019ve obviously been a net seller in DC, and we look at all these markets to try to find a deal that fits our parameters, Michael. So, I would say the acquisition market is not easy to find deals right now, that meet that criteria because there\u2019s more money and more demand for it than I think the deals volume right now suggests. So, we\u2019ll continue to look at it and whether we\u2019ll be a net seller or whether we will continue to sell remains to be seen.\nMichael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors\nThanks. And then if I can ask one other question if we have time. I\u2019m just curious on Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, would you give a quick comment maybe on your thoughts on prospects for the business heading into the holiday period? And then with respect to a holding period, should we continue to assume that we\u2019re probably looking at maybe 2014 as maybe the soonest exit, you could probably do from that business, from that investment?\nMichael Fascitelli\nOh, yeah. And we\u2019re right in the \u2013 I\u2019ll comment on the first part of that question. First, we\u2019re right in the middle of obviously the beginning of the holiday season which has been a little bit disruptive this week by the massive problems in the Northeast. But our hopes are good for this season. I\u2019m not going to comment specifically but we\u2019re in that period right now on the numbers, but obviously we\u2019ll have a better view of that post-Christmas. And the opportunities, as I said previously, and all the sponsors are looking for a very good exit at the right time. So, I would think that 2013 and 2014 will be a focus on how we monetize that investment.\nOperator\nThank you. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Michael Fascitelli.\nMichael Fascitelli\nI want to thank you all for tuning in and giving us your attention and time. We know this is a particularly difficult time for many of you with offices in New York and maybe not even in offices in New York. We always appreciate your comments and we appreciate your questions. And we look forward to our third conference call coming up hopefully without the circumstances we\u2019ve had in the first two. So, we\u2019ll see you all later. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\n\n",

[Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Daniel Cravens. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Cravens\nThanks, Peter, and thanks, everybody for joining us for the US Airways First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. In the room with us in Phoenix this morning are Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Scott Kirby our President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room available for questions are -- is Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications. \nLike we typically do, we're going to start with Doug, and he'll provide an overview of our first quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter, including our cost, liquidity and provide some color on our updated guidance. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from those comments, we will open the call for analyst questions and, lastly, questions from the media. \nBut before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, and our 2011 Form 10-K. \nIn addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net loss and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is also included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at usairways.com. \nA webcast of this call is also available on our website and will be archived for approximately one month. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thanks, again, for joining us. And at this point, we'll turn the call over to Doug.\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nThank you, Dan, and thanks to everybody for being on. We announced this morning our first quarter net loss, excluding some special credits of $22 million. That compares very favorably to last year's net loss of $110 million. That improvement in earnings occurred despite a 13% increase in our fuel price per gallon and had fuel prices remained at the -- what we thought were quite high first short quarter for 2011 levels, our fuel expense would have been $133 million lower here in the first quarter of 2012. \nSo our earnings -- our loss was nearly $100 million lower than it was last year, even though fuel expense was $133 million higher. The reason for that improvement is strong revenue growth. Our revenues were up 10% year-over-year. That's driven by record load bankers, record yield, record unit revenues, that is passenger revenue per ASM. And Scott will talk about that in more detail in a minute. \nWe also -- the team also did an excellent job of controlling our nonfuel expense. Cost per ASM, excluding fuel, declined by 0.6% on a year-over-year basis, and Derek will talk more about that. And the credit for all this, of course, goes to the outstanding team we have at US Airways, who just continue to do an amazing job of taking care of our customers. We had our best first quarter ever and on-time performance and baggage handling and completion factor. So I want to conclude my comments by just thanking very much the 32,000 hardworking people at US Airways. \nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Derek and then Scott.\nDerek J. Kerr\nThanks, Doug. We just filed our first quarter 10-Q this morning, and in that Q, we reported a net loss, excluding net special credits of $22 million or a loss of $0.13 per diluted share. This compares favorably to the net loss, excluding special items of $110 million or $0.68 loss per share a year ago. On a GAAP basis, the company reported a net profit for the first quarter of $48 million or $0.28 per diluted share versus a net loss of $114 million or $0.71 loss per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. \nThis quarter's results were once again impacted by the significant year-over-year increase in fuel prices. And as Doug said, if average fuel price had remained the same as first quarter 2011, the company's fuel expense would've been approximately $133 million lower. \nThe company did recognize $70 million of net special credits in the first quarter of 2012. This was principally a gain associated with the Delta slot transaction completed in December 2011. This transaction resulted in a gain of $147 million, all of which was deferred as of December 31, 2011, due to certain DOT restrictions on the operations of the slots. The gain on the transaction is being recognized, as these DOT restrictions lapse, so March 2012 and July 2012, so we recognized approximately $73 million of the gain in the first quarter, and we expect to recognize the remaining $74 million of gain in the third quarter of 2012. \nFor the quarter, total capacity was 21.1 billion ASMs, up 3% from 2011, primarily due to a higher year-over-year completion factor of approximately 3%. Thanks to the efforts of all of our team members, we, US Airways, achieved our best-ever, first quarter completion factor, on-time performance and mishandled bag ratio. Just tremendous performance by our operating group. \nOur mainline capacity for the quarter was 17.7 billion ASMs, up 4.0% from a year ago. Express capacity was 3.4 billion ASMs, down 1.8% from 2011, mostly due to the conversion to our new Express first product on all of our large RJ aircraft. \nDuring 2012, we do plan to reduce our fleet by 3 aircraft, adding 12 new A321s, while returning 15 older 737 leased aircraft. These aircraft are coming in, in the third and fourth quarters, with 6 of them in the third and 6 in the fourth. Express fleet count is anticipated to decrease by one aircraft in 2012. \nMainline ASMs are projected to be 73.7 billion this year, which is up approximately 1.5% versus 2011, primarily due to the higher seat count on A321 aircraft, which are replacing 737 aircraft. ASM breakdown by quarter is as follows: at approximately 19.2 billion in the second; 19.3 billion in the third; 17.5 billion the fourth. Express capacity for the year is forecasted to be 14.18 billion ASMs, up approximately 1% from 2011. \nStrong passenger demand and record passenger yields led to our improved revenue performance. Total operating revenues for the first quarter of 2012 were $3.3 billion, up 10.3% for the same period in 2011 on a 3% increase in ASMs. Mainline passenger revenues were $2.1 billion, up 11.4% as a result of the strong pricing environment and continued industry capacity discipline. Cargo revenues were down 6% year-over-year, coming in at $40 million, driven by lower international volume. \nTotal passenger RASM increased 8.2% to a record $0.1362 in 2012 versus first quarter 2011, with mainline up 7.1% and Express up 13.7%. This revenue performance was driven by a record load factor of 79.3%, which increased 1.3 points versus 2011 and a 6.5% increase in passenger yields of $0.1719. Total RASM in the first quarter was up 7.1%. \nOn the expense side, airline's operating expense for the first quarter were $3.2 billion, up 6.9% compared to a year ago due primarily to $160 million increase in consolidated fuel expense. Our first quarter results were significantly impacted by the high price of fuel. Our average mainline fuel price including taxes was $3.26 per gallon for the first quarter of 2012 versus $2.87 per gallon in the first quarter of 2011, a 13.4% increase.\nFacing sharply higher fuel prices, our employees continue to do an excellent job of increasing revenues and maintaining our strategic cost advantage by keeping costs in line. Excluding special items in fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0871 in the quarter, a decrease of 0.6% versus 2011. Express operating cost per ASM x fuel and special items was $0.1533 for the quarter, up 1.5% on a 1.8% decrease in ASMs. \nWe're maintaining our unit cost guidance going forward, which should enable us to maintain our cost advantage versus the other major carriers. Our CASM x fuel and profit sharing guidance for the remainder of 2012 has mainline line up 1% at 3% versus 2011. This breaks down by quarter as follows: The second quarter should be up 1% to 3%; third quarter, up 2% to 4%; and fourth quarter, up 1% to 3%. Express CASM for the full year 2012 is forecasted to be flat to down 2%. \nFor the full year, we're forecasting fuel price in the range of $3.28 to $3.33. This is based on yesterday's forward curve. Our forecast breaks down as follows: $3.30 to $3.35 in the second and third quarters; and $3.28 to $3.33 in the fourth quarter. \nOn the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.54 billion in total cash and investments, of which $2.19 billion was unrestricted. Our total unrestricted cash balance increased by $243 million from December 31, 2011. The company generated $470 million of cash flow from operations and used $115 million for debt payments for the first 3 months of 2012. \nDuring the quarter, we amended our co-branded credit card agreement with Barclays. This amendment reduced our debt payments by -- in 2012 and 2013, by $100 million each year. Scheduled payments now commence in January 2014 over a period of 2 years. \nLast week, we were able to complete a 2-year standalone credit facility for $100 million using the slots we reacquired legal title to from our public airlines in December 2011 as collateral. The company was also able to secure financing commitments for 4 of our 12 deliveries in the back half of 2012. Two of these aircraft will be debt financed, while the other 2 will be sale leasebacks. We are currently finalizing plans to finance the remaining aircraft deliveries in 2012, which all have backstop financing available. \nThere's no change to our CapEx forecast. First quarter non-aircraft CapEx was $40 million. We expect forecast total CapEx to be $306 million in 2012. This includes non-aircraft CapEx of $170 million and net aircraft CapEx of $136 million. \nSo in summary, I'd like to thank all of our 32,000 employees for, once again, effectively managing through a first quarter that saw record-high fuel prices. Our strong revenue performance, diligent cost control, capacity discipline and industry-leading operational reliability have us positioned to compete favorably in 2012 and beyond. With that I will turn it over to Scott.\nJ. Scott Kirby\nThanks, Derek. Before discussing the revenue environment, I'd like to thank all the employees of US Airways for all the hard work for the great airline that we're running today. We, once again, had record operational results in the first quarter. \nTurning to the revenue environment. I'll start with a review of the first quarter, and then give you a little bit of commentary on the outlook going forward. We were pleased with our 8% year-over-year increase in passenger RASM. Both leisure and business demand were strong during the quarter. During the quarter, we successfully passed through all of the increase in fuel prices in the form of higher fares. January was strong and in line with our expectations. But February RASM was weaker than we expected due partially to a much higher completion factor but also due to some relative booking weakness that lasted for about 3 weeks at the beginning of the month. March RASM rebounded and was strong and in line with our expectations. Our view of the February data point is that it's just normal volatility and is similar to what happened in June of last year, when the comps got worse for a single month before rebounding. \nWhile leisure demand was strong, corporate demand was extremely strong, with corporate account revenue, up 29% during the quarter. During the quarter, our transatlantic RASM was up 11%. Domestic was up 8%, and Latin Caribbean was up 7%. \nTurning to the outlook going forward. The second quarter picked up where March left off. The strong demand environment is leading to a strong pricing environment. There'd been several well reported fare increases, but more significantly the fare sale environment is less aggressive this year than last year, as airlines have been forced to pass on the increase in fuel prices. \nRegionally, we continue to see strength in both the Atlantic and domestic markets. We currently anticipate Atlantic and domestic RASM to each be up a similar amount year-over-year in the second quarter. Also, we continue to see strength in business demand and expect that to continue throughout the quarter. \nAs we move forward, the costs do a little get -- do get a little more difficult, particularly in May. We expect April RASM to be up about 9% year-over-year and May to be up a little less on a year-over-year basis in April just based on more difficult comps. The June costs get easier, so while we don't have enough bookings to have a reliable forecast yet, I expect June will be better on a year-over-year basis than May. So in conclusion, we continue to run the best operation in the industry and in our history, and the demand environment remains strong. \nWith that I'll turn it back to Doug.\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nThank you, Derek. Thank you, Scott. Okay, before I get to questions, I know there are -- I think, other than our earnings, a number of you would like to talk about -- and ask us questions about those include what is going on with the situation, US Airways and AMR. So before we get to questions, we're going to talk a little bit about AMR, because, again, we know it's -- you're interested in where we are on that process. \nI'll tell you upfront we're going to share what we can now. However, we will only be taking questions on our earnings, not the situation when we get to the Q&A. So -- but we'll tell you a good little bit of what we can at this point, and I'll start, and then Scott will add some as well. \nSo first, a little bit on the process. We told you all in our last earnings call that we'd hired advisors to help us assess the situation in AMR and to determine if this might create a strategic opportunity for a business combination. Now we've been hard at work over the past 3 months and have concluded that there's an opportunity to do something that we think is in the best interest of both companies, owners or creditors, in the case of AMR, both companies' employees, our customers and the communities we serve. \nAMR, however, has made it clear they would like to focus only on a standalone emergence from bankruptcy. So while we would prefer to be working in concert with the AMR management team and its board and hope to be doing so before too long, we understand where their focus is, and instead, we've been working with the creditors and employees of AMR. Our goal has been to first get the support of the unions, then the full unsecured creditors' committee, after which point we would look forward to a cooperative and consensual process with AMR's board and management team. \nNow on Friday, we took a big step in that direction, when we disclosed that we'd reached agreement with each of the Allied Pilots Association, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants and the Transport Workers Union. These 3 unions that represent over 50,000 AMR employees, and they also issued a joint statement on Friday in support of a potential merger. So we are extremely grateful for their support. And we share their desire and enthusiasm to work together to build a truly great airline. \nSo now with those 50,000-plus employees on our -- by our side, we are focused on the full unsecured creditors' committee, and while we're not going to comment on that process or any discussions that may or may not be taking place, we are eager to demonstrate to the creditors of AMR that our plan would result in higher returns than the AMR standalone strategy would. And we're highly confident that the value created by our 2 companies is very large, relative to the value of a standalone AMR. \nNow then, that's the point on process. One thing that has occurred that we've seen as a recurring question since Friday's announcement with the unions is a -- and we want to take a -- it's a question that we want take a minute to address. And that question is how can you guys have labor so excited about transaction and still have value for investors? And again that appears to be a question that's important to people out there, so we are going to take the time to address that, and now I can say, we have 2 questions about earnings. So anyway, Scott, you want to take that question?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nThanks, Doug. And the answer to that is pretty straightforward. There's a tremendous amount of value created by merging US Airways and AMR, and we can and should do the portion of that to give employees more than AMR can on a standalone basis. It's premature to get into all the details about the source of synergies or the mechanics of any potential transaction, but I think that we can help on this point about the synergies. \nFirst off, I think every airline analyst and probably everyone listening to this call appreciates that a merger of US Airways and American Airlines would create enormous revenue synergies. Like United Continental, Delta-Northwest, US Airways AMR would have a network that could generate much more revenue than the 2 airlines can independently. We can also generate significant cost savings, even though we wouldn't shrink the combined airline by reducing or eliminating redundant facility space, management headcount, by combining IT systems and by much improved purchasing power. \nFor perspective, Delta-Northwest generated $2 billion in synergies, which was 6.3% of their combined revenues. Continental-United generated $1.1 billion in synergies, 3.9% of their combined revenues. And US Airways-America West generated $680 million in synergies or 6.5% of our combined revenues. \nAs to the agreements we've signed with AMR's unions, I can describe them at a high level. Prior to bankruptcy, AMR said that their labor costs were $800 million over industry standards. In bankruptcy, however, American is asked for concessionary contract of $1.25 billion, meaning AMR's asked and labor went beyond industry average. And for what it worth -- for what it's worth, it appears AMR's $800 million disadvantage to the industry was basically all pensions and productivity. \nWe agree with all 3 unions that the merged American needs to have contracts that have neither a competitive advantage nor disadvantage to Delta and United. This merger creates an airline that can compete effectively against United and Delta. Since the new American will have revenue-generating capabilities like United and Delta, it should also have labor costs like United and Delta. \nThe leadership at all 3 unions recognize the need to be competitive and agreed with US Airways to freeze the pensions and to productivity enhancements that get AMR to a competitive position with United and Delta. So the synergies created by our merger allow us to set the pay of USA -- US Airways and AMR employees, comparable to the pay at United and Delta. The result is better contracts than American can pay independently and much better than they are attempting to impose on their employees to the 11 13 prices. \nBut those increases in compensation do not come close to negating the tremendous benefit and synergies created by merging US Airways and American. Indeed, we estimate that the synergies created by US-AMR merger, net of the labor de-synergies, when compared against AMR's standalone 11 13 plan, conservatively are estimated at over $1.2 billion per year. This means significantly greater recoveries for AMR's creditors and US shareholders are available. Also, the impact to labor and jobs is far less draconian, because some of the synergies have been appropriately shared with labor to better pay and to fewer job cuts. \nThe union leadership and employees of AMR have shown great leadership in getting us to this point. Importantly, they recognized early on that the goal is to build a company that could succeed, compete and restore American to its rightful place as a preeminent airline in the country. They recognize that labor cost is needed to be competitive to make that vision a reality, but we also recognize that it wasn't necessary to go beyond industry standard. \nWe worked together as partners with ATA, APFA and the TWU to forge a merger that will restore American to its preeminent position in the industry, do so with a competitive cost structure and with a route network that's built to compete and win. With that, I'll turn it back to Doug for Q&A.\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nGreat, all right. Thanks, Scott. Hopefully, that was helpful to those of you that had been asking that question. I mean, the issue for us, of course, is we can't really address that question without having information public. And now we do, and hopefully that addresses that question that we've heard from a number of you. \nBut now as we head into our Q&A, I'm going to thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation. We know you have your more questions, and would like to ask more about AMR or more about what we just said. But please understand, we now said all we're going to say at this time. And we'll, instead, turn our attention to the strong results that our team reported today. So questions, please.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Bill Greene.\nWilliam J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nIf I ask to start on revenue trends, Scott, you went through a pretty detailed sort of outlook here. But one of the things -- with the fare increases that haven't stuck. Is that because the real impact here is the fare sales that aren't occurring? Is that really kind of what we would reconcile here? Or is the industry still just a little bit too big on capacity? I'm just not sure how to reconcile failures on fare increases.\nJ. Scott Kirby\nOkay. I guess I'd start with saying that, while the fare increases are easy to follow through ATPT [ph] reporting, and they get a lot of the headlines, they really aren't -- they're a third or fourth in terms of importance in what our actual yields wind up being. And if you look historically, I think about 1 and 3 of those fare increases through successfully even in strong demand environment for a whole host of reasons if they don't go through successfully. So I wouldn't read anything negative about a failure of a fare increase into that. What's more important, or at least as important, is the lack of deeply discounted fare sales, I mean, just do the math. If last year, there was a fare sale that was 40% off, and this year, there's no fare sale, then that's almost over a 60% increase in the selling fare in those markets. And so that's far more impactful. There's also been a lot of, what I would call, cleanups going on in the market with getting fares that used to be a 7-day advance purchased and somehow became 0-day advance purchase, back to 7-day advance purchase and a lot of other initiatives like that, which have an impact on fares and demand. So if you just look at our results, look at the results across the industry, the demand environment certainly feels good, it feels strong. Yields are robust and the industry, I think, is successfully passing on the increase in fuel prices.\nWilliam J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nThat makes sense. So essentially, it's rebuilding fences and some revenue management? Is that sort of the short version of it?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nWell, those -- I mean, all of those things are occurring, yes.\nWilliam J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nIs that a process that has a lot further to go, or -- because I'm trying to figure out, like if we see this sort of continue, maybe it's not something to worry about as much, because there's enough that you can do on the margin with RM and whatnot to keep the RASM trend without fare increases of sort of a public and significant size.\nJ. Scott Kirby\nWell, without commenting on future fare actions, I certainly think there's opportunity to do that. And from an investor perspective, it's going to be really hard for you as an analyst or an individual investor to track the pricing market and get an idea of exactly what's happening, other than looking at all of our monthly disclosures on RASM and you can -- and load factor which you can have back in the yield. And I think that will give you a much more comprehensive view of what's really happening on the ground.\nWilliam J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nOkay, that makes sense. And then, Doug, just one question for you on industry structure -- I know, we can leave consolidations out. But we haven't seen any efforts to see any new entrants into this business for a while. Do you think that's kind of a more permanent change? Or is that simply -- there's more attractive opportunities elsewhere? Or maybe it's fuel? Or how do you think about if the industry has sort of permanently addressed that aspect of what has always been a big challenge?\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nLook, I hope it's permanent though, but who knows. My own view is it's really hard -- why would you possibly invest in a start-up airline at this point. You've got an industry that is -- as we've said for a while now, mature on the domestic front. So there aren't growth opportunities to exploit in the domestic United States, and fuel prices are very high, so your -- the ability getting cost advantage primarily, just by labor, which is what these airlines always have is a cost advantage, driven entirely by labor cost is -- creates less of an advantage when oil prices are your largest expense instead of back when they used to be our second or third largest expense. So your cost advantage is less, and furthermore, through all the restructuring that's happened in this industry, the labor cost have gotten more in line with what a start-up airline can put in place. So I think, if you put that all together and anyone that truly looks at the potential for a return quickly realizes there's no potential for return. And again, I know that hasn't stopped people in the past, but I think they could at least look at some analysis and convince themselves. I think anyone who's going to put capital in this business, getting into a startup airline right now would have to be extremely aggressive in their assumptions to get themselves to believe they have any chance of making a return.\nWilliam J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nYes. Of course, the risk would be with consolidation, if the returns rise as that calculus change, right? So you -- either we create a more permanent barrier somehow or seems like the risk doesn't change if returns are higher. But we'll see, I suppose.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Hunter Keay.\nHunter K. Keay - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division\nSo I keep seeing airlines talking about how great these bag handling stats are. And the pessimist in me just immediately concludes that fewer and fewer people are checking or paying for checked bags. So I guess the question is, without getting to specifics, is it time to address some of maybe the cost savings that could be extracted now, if 30%, 40% fewer bags are being checked. Is there anything that can be done in the infrastructure side or on the headcount side that can basically just permanently start to strip out some of the costs that existed before, when people were checking a lot of bags? Or is there other more revenues -- other more sort of levers you could pull on the revenue side?\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nOkay, well, look, first off, you shouldn't be pessimistic about this. This is one of the nice things that happens as result of charging for bags, as people don't check bags, and they don't want to pay to have it checked and there are fewer bags that ride in the belly. And this, like any other system that has capacity constraints, you take out 20%, 25% of the bags in the belly, and you dramatically reduce the number of bags that are mishandled, much more than 20%, 25%, because you're not stressing the capacity. So that's a good thing. And we've always known it was going to be a good thing about these baggage fees. It's not just about raising revenues. It makes the operation run better, and then that has happened. So anyway, to your point, now that, that's happened can you do things about cost? I'll let Derek or Scott chime in, because I don't know that we've had a long conversation about this. But the problem, I think, Hunter, is you still need to do the -- you still need to connect bags. You still need the bag belts, you still need people running bags, even though there aren't as many, as long as you need any less of any of those things. So I don't know that you're going to see a lot of cost in terms of infrastructure cost reductions but \u2013 I'll let these guys chime in. But you do see a lot of cost savings in terms of mishandled baggage delivery, costs and things like that, we're already seeing those. Your question is -- there's question on infrastructure. I don't -- I'm not sure how we get rid of the infrastructure, as long as people still check bags, even though they're checking fewer.\nJ. Scott Kirby\nYes. I would agree to that, Doug. We did get rid of a fair amount of infrastructure off the bat, so having fewer people at the check-in counter that has happened. The one thing that does happen though is down at the gate area, since there are more bags that go down at the gate area, we've had to adjust from a ramp worker's standpoint as adding some ramp workers to make sure that all those bags that sometimes can't fit on the plane need to get down and get in the belly from that area. So we've added a little bit there. But I think there have been a tremendous amount of cost savings, as Doug said, from delivery and from not losing the bag and also some savings that we have had in place for a couple of years at the ticket counters. And that has all been put in place. But right now, we don't expect to go any deeper than that moving forward.\nHunter K. Keay - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division\nOkay. And again, without getting into specifics, of course, that caveat. If you were in charge of running an airline that was almost as big as UAL but a little bit bigger than Del -- Delta, would you still not hedge fuel? Or is that something that you think is unique to your company right now, as you sit here? Or do you think that's a broader strategy that has proven itself to work that could work, if you were in charge of a bigger airline?\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nOkay. Let's ignore the conditional part of that question. And I'll just restate it as follows. Does it make sense for any airline to hedge? We don't think so, and I don't think it would matter if we were other airlines. Those are management decisions. But for all the reasons we stated in the past, that it is extremely expensive to do one; two, the cost of doing it does not protect you from -- certainly, from long enough from what appears airlines are trying to protect themselves from, point two; and then point three, that you, actually -- you're not reducing the risk of the firm, because you're creating yet another risk, which is the fuel prices could fall only because the economy gets soft, and you then find yourself paying higher prices, at the same time, your revenues are falling, you're paying them in advance. It's a highly risky proposition that no one protects themselves from when they hedge. And allow me to say that we have a natural hedge in place, which the revenue stream for most of this activity. And the activity is not protected by that. It's going to create -- or would create bigger issues for the industry than anyone's hedging position can protect them from. So for all those reasons, I don't think it matters where we are. But that's US Airways position, and obviously, not the other [indiscernible].\nOperator\nJamie Baker has our next question.\nJamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nGuess what, I'm going to ask a question on consolidation, but I think it's one that actually you can hopefully answer. It relates to pricing. If you look at airline revenue as a percentage of GDP, as we all do, it has been fairly steady, post 9/11 with the obvious exception of financial crisis. But clearly that relationship, the percentage of economic output that the US shares with its airline industry is materially lower than what it was in the decades leading up to the Internet. So do you think it's reasonable that with a bit more industry consolidation, we might finally see some real improvement in this metric? I mean, perhaps not back to pre-Internet levels, but something better than where we've been for the past decade. I guess, I'm a little surprised we haven't seen more progress already. I guess my question is how much incremental pricing power is the market share of the big 3 plus Southwest going to be, if events push big 3 in Southwest to 90% market share?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nWell, I'll start with the caveat, that I don't think this is a consolidation-driven answer. But what we saw happen for years after deregulation was a decline in industry revenues as a percentage of GDP. That hit a trough, as you said in 2009 levels that were, I think, artificially low and significantly below where they were historically. We have started rebounding from that as an industry. Airline industry revenues have grown more quickly than GDP in 2010, '11. And then it appears we're going to do the same in '12. They certainly started off going faster than GDP in 2012. And I think we are recovering as an industry to a more normalized levels. To be clear I don't think that's a consolidation driven effect. I think it is as the industry matures and becomes more disciplined that we're doing a better job of passing our costs on to the customer, in particularly higher fuel prices. But I certainly think there's upside, if you just look at the metric -- I like that metric as well, Jamie. If you look at the metric of airline revenues as a percentage of GDP, and where it was historically. You can make a credible argument that there's a lot of potential left to -- for the airline industry to continue outperforming GDP growth going forward.\nJamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nYes. I mean, I would happen to agree. I mean, it seems -- I mean, that's the metric that I always draw people's attention to. When there's a fare increase investors will ask, is there any pricing resistance, sticker shock? And you look at that metric, and it's just seems to suggest a lot of incremental potential from here. So I appreciate your insight on that, Scott.\nOperator\nDan McKenzie, please go ahead.\nDaniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division\nMy first question's really housecleaning. And that is if the entire cost of the shift of aircraft from LaGuardia to Reagan was included in your special charges or were there some other charges tied to the slot swap that were not stripped out of the first quarter cost.\nJ. Scott Kirby\nDan, that's not a cost. It's just the value we had for the slots on the books. So it's really just a write-off of that. The cost is in our guidance, so the shift of us moving from LaGuardia to DCA, all of those costs are in our guidance. So any savings that we're going to have from that are in there. But that's just the value of what we had for the slots on the books. And so that, we had them booked down lower, and so the gain we have to take all at one point in time. So we've taken a gain, and we've split it over half and half is when we've transitioned to the set of slots. So each slot, the value that we had on the books for the slots, what we received for them was higher, so we had to take that gain. So that's just slot related and not cost related.\nDaniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. Though I appreciate the clarification, it looked like there was an operating charge of $3 million that jumped out at me. But then, I guess, how much is that inflating cost in the first and second quarter as a result? Is it material?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nNo, it should be reducing cost.\nDaniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division\nYes, sorry. So how much is that...\nJ. Scott Kirby\nYes, it should be reducing cost. We said all along that the transaction is worth $75 million to us. Part of that is in the cost in our cost guidance. Most of it in the third and fourth quarters.\nDaniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division\nYes. No, I understand that. I guess, my question really was there's -- as you transition aircraft from LaGuardia to Reagan National, there would be some costs associated with that, but I guess, evidently not...\nJ. Scott Kirby\nNo, not really, not at all.\nDaniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And then, I guess, my second question is, I look at competitive seats overlapping your market from competitors, it looks like it was down about 5% in the first quarter, which is a little unusual in size. And I'm just wondering if you can share what kind of revenue tailwind that helped provide for you folks?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nI guess, I wouldn't have measured the numbers being as large. There were some competitive good guys in the quarter in Philadelphia and towards the end of the quarter some competitive bad guys in Philadelphia. But certainly, we had a tailwind compared to last year, where we had the opposite where we have more competitive capacity growth in our market. I think it's just the normal ebb and flow. Sometimes you get more -- sometimes you get good guys, sometimes you get a bad guy. And the first and the -- in the first quarter, we had a net good guy. In the second quarter, I think, it's still a net good guy, though it's smaller. But not a huge impact one way or the other.\nOperator\nHelane Becker has the next question.\nHelane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division\nSo this is my first question. I think your PSA flight attendants approved a contract last week. And so therefore, number one, is there -- are there other contracts in that regional group that are coming up that we should be prepared for? And b, that's a. And b, the other part of the question is, are the costs associated with that included in the guidance you're giving us for the second quarter?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nYes, Helane, the cost of that contract is in our guidance going forward from -- for Express.\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nYes. And, Helane, thanks for noting it. We did indeed get a contract on our flight attendants. We have contract negotiations currently underway now with the pilot group as well at PMAN [ph] anyway. So but those, again, nothing really to report on those, other than they're underway. And we don't expect material cost increases, just because of the relative size as we complete those.\nHelane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And then you have to go back -- could you just maybe walk through the timing and what happens now with your flight attendant -- your main flight attendant who rejected a contract. Because, I guess, you have to go back and start over? Or it's probably going to be another year before anything happens there. Can you just talk about that a little?\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nI don't want to -- let me answer your question, I don't know that I'd agree with that timing or not, but frankly, we just don't know at this point. We did indeed come to terms with our flight attendants on a tentative agreement, which was unanimously approved by the negotiating committee after a lot of work with -- that negotiating committee and under the guidance and jurisdiction of the National Mediation Board. We all worked together and came up with a contract that the committee again unanimously approved. The company also approved but then as sometimes is the case, it went out for ratification and didn't get passed. So we have to go work on figuring out what to do next. That's where the company and our flight attendants at the FAA is at this point. It was -- clearly, we were disappointed by that. I don't think it's good for our flight attendants. It is going to delay what would've been some nice increases, but also what it shows is we barely didn't have the right mix in there to get to where -- more than 1/2 of the flight attendants wanted to approve it. So what happens now is we have to go figure out what happened. FAA is out surveying numbers, trying to figure out why -- what it was they did or didn't like, that process needs to take place. FAA needs to put a new negotiating team together. They have some leadership issues they are working through that need to get addressed. And all that needs to take place. And then lastly, the National Mediation Board, which is extremely busy and thought they were done with this one. We'll need to let us know when they're ready to start working with us again. So all those things will indeed take some time, I don't know how much time. But right now, that's what's going on, which is we're regrouping. And it will take some time to regroup. I don't want to speculate as to how much time that will take, but we will -- we'll regroup, and we'll eventually get this done but we -- it didn't get passed the first time through.\nHelane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And then can I just ask a question about the competitive position in Philadelphia, where a lot of low fare capacity has come out and some of what is US Airways' core would be considered traditional or core markets like Boston and Pittsburgh. Can you say how much the revenue increase you're seeing overall in your domestic -- is maybe related to Philadelphia? And how much is related to the rest of the system?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nI can't give you a specific number, but those markets in Philadelphia, while that was an important event for us, and it's good for US Airways. On a system-level, that's surrounding on the revenue, I think, because they're just not a big -- enough ASMs to make a difference across the whole system. And while we have those markets like Pittsburgh and Boston that we had a competitive capacity reduction, we have others like Los Angeles and San Francisco, where we have new competitive capacity convergence. So you win with one hand and lose on the other in that analysis. But I don't think it's a meaningful impact to our revenue and RASM one way or the other.\nOperator\nA question now from Michael Linenberg.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nJust 2 questions here for Scott. Scott, we heard on the Delta call that -- they indicated that their performance from LaGuardia, the margin in that hub was -- saw the biggest year-over-year increase. And on an absolute basis it was the highest, and they attribute it to slot swap and the fact that they're only saying half of it, they don't leave you and they won't get the full benefit until June. My sense is that your DCA hub historically has been a bit more profitable than LaGuardia. Is there any color that you can provide maybe similar along the lines, what, they've provided, what you're seeing thus far?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nSure. While I don't think the slot swap had a real impact on our first quarter profitability, it didn't -- the first half of it didn't get effectuated until March 25, so just wasn't enough time to make a real difference in DCA. We've been pleased with the result so far. It's still, of course, early, so it's hard to have real good data. But this wasn't also the kind of transaction that was speculative in nature. So we're highly confident of the $75 million in annual benefits that we're going to get from this transaction when it's completed. And everything that we see so far is consistent with that and expect that to continue. And you're right that DCA is -- starts from a nicely profitable position for us.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nVery good. And then just my second question, just to follow up on the point that Jamie brought up about airline revenue relative to U.S. GDP. And you made a comment that you've seen it outpaced for the past couple of years. Is that -- are you referring to -- is that also similar on the domestic number? Or were you referring on a domestic revenue number? Or is that on a system number? And I just -- I wanted -- started distinguish between the 2, because as a whole, it does seem like the U.S. airline industry today has a lot more exposure to faster growing GDP economies than maybe what it had 5 or 10 years ago. So it seems like a mix issue, although, I think, in your case, most of your revenue is actually -- your international revenue seems to be tied to some of the older economies, which actually are growing at a slower rate than the U.S. So just any clarification on that?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nWell, the number that I referred to is domestic only, because you're looking at domestic GDP, and you'd have to include what's flying on international carriers to and from the U.S. and so it would be -- it will be hard to consider. So the number is domestic though. If you did the proper adjustments, I think you'd see something similar including international revenue. For us, we're very happy with the route network we have. We do have growth opportunities in the near term. Latin America, we're looking forward to being able to start S\u00e3o Paulo service. Soon we're working with the Brazilian regulatory authorities to be able to start that. And then longer-term, service to Asia as we begin taking delivery of A350.\nOperator\nMoving on, let's go to Glenn Engel.\nGlenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nA couple of questions. One, are there any of your core markets, your hubs, which stood out on the upside or on the downside?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nIf you look through a list of 300 markets there's always going to be some that are positive and some that are less positive.\nGlenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nI was thinking of the main core ones, Philly, Charlotte, DC and Phoenix.\nJ. Scott Kirby\nThis is creative markets that relatively better and for one big market that did really well, Charlotte to Rio, as that continues to ramp up, and we continue to get more recognition in that market. Charlotte-Rio did extremely well. But really, all of our hubs, the business-oriented markets in all of our hubs did well.\nGlenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nThe salary per employee was up about 4% year-over-year. What drove that? Is that something I'd expect to continue?\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nYes, Glenn. Let's try and [indiscernible] we have been trying to get through thinking about this, but we have across-the-board increases. For the most part, you can go through step increases that run something to that level. We give about a 3% adjustment. And there also might be a mix issue in there, as we have...\nJ. Scott Kirby\nWell, part of it is RAS, because we've in-sourced RAS, so you've had a little bit of change on the RAS side, bringing that back in. Dispatchers -- we had a contract that got put in place last year, so the dispatchers was an increase year-over-year. And then from a benefit standpoint, the way we deal with stock compensation and accrue for stock compensation year-over-year went up about $10 million, just from the fact that our stock price went up, so there's things like that in there. But from a total salary and related year-over-year that CASM was only about 1.7%. Pilots and flight attendants were actually -- and mechanics were actually down. So those were the areas that hit us from a -- from that standpoint, Glenn.\nGlenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nIs that stock comp issue a onetime thing or continue?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nSomething that we've gone. In certain, cases the cash settled stock compensation. And at that point, you have to market-to-market every quarter. So it can fluctuate up and down, and year-over-year, that was a change for us of about $9.5 million in our cost in 2012 versus 2011.\nGlenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nAnd I'm going to cheat now and say is there comments you can make on how your labor fits in this consolidation process, how your negotiations then?\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nThis is important since a lot of our employees are listening in. But what we told them early last week is we don't -- US Airways doesn't need to do -- again, all I'm doing is reiterating what was said last Friday. US Airways, as these results confirm, we don't have to do anything. We used to talk about our performance, but I know you guys will go compare these other airlines, and when you do, what you'll see is first quarter is a difficult quarter, as you guys all know for all airlines. But we have margin performance now. This quarter, anyway, equals Southwest. That's never happened to this airline. It's pretty much right in line with Delta. I suspect it'll be better than what United reports tomorrow. We are doing quite well on our own and have no need to do anything. Having said that, and for all the reasons always stated, they may make sense in the future for us to do something. And if we do, making sure that US Airways employees are better off because of it is on the forefront of anything we're going to do. So anyway, without giving any details or pretending to, we have consistently said, and I'm happy to continue saying that if we do anything, what's nice to know is it's ours to decide if we want to do something, because we're doing really well standalone. And if we decide to do something, it'll because -- it'll be because we think it makes sense for everyone at US Airways. And that certainly includes the people that have gotten us here, which is the 32,000 people that are working really hard for this airline.\nOperator\nMoving on, we go to Ray Neidl.\nRaymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division\nScott, with your excellent background in statistics. I have complete faith in your policy of not trying to fuel-hedge. But what do you think about an airline buying a refinery, would that help? Have you ever looked at that, or is that just a laughing matter. I guess, it's a laughing matter from your reaction.\nJ. Scott Kirby\nDoug's not going to allow me to comment.\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nBut look, one thing I will note is we made a lot of progress if airlines are looking at investing their capital and things like that. I think we're not -- people at Delta are really smart people, and we have a lot of respect for them. Whatever they think makes -- just do with their capital. I'm just really excited to see we got this business to a point that people are looking at investing capital into things like that instead of taking it and buying more airplanes that don't get a return.\nRaymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division\nOkay, great. And Scott, on ancillary revenue type plane, you guys have been leader here. Is that pretty much topped out right now, with people packing less and revenues going down on bag charges, or have you reconsidered maybe charging for carry-on bags?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nThe general counsel won't let me comment on things like that, because they're pricing-related actions, future -- forward-looking pricing-related actions. I don't think we're topped out on ancillary revenues without regard to the question about bags. I think the next big opportunity is choice seats, which is already big for us and is going to be running at a run rate of $100 million here by the end of this year, and which I think can be $300 million-plus line of business in a few years once we get that, able to be sold through all distribution channels. And today, we're working with online travel agencies to hopefully start selling that. And we're also working with Sabre, and have a product that Sabre travel agency will be able to sell choice seats as well.\nRaymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division\nOkay, great. And Derek, do you have a target for your debt-to-capitalization ratio? I imagine, if that the ratio improves, your stock could probably get a higher multiple?\nDerek J. Kerr\nNo, we don't have a target for that right now. I mean our goal is to continue to raise cash. During the quarter, we did a good job of bringing in $100 million and deferring some debt payments. So our goal is to really just to continue to increase cash at this point in time.\nOperator\nAnd a question now from Bob McAdoo.\nBob McAdoo - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division\nThe comments with Michael Linenberg took care most of my questions, but just one last little thing on the slot swaps. With the new markets that you're in, in Washington, how many of them are brand new markets that people just haven't had nonstop service to DCA? And is there a spool-up kind of thing, or do those things start up pretty well? The rest of it has been handled with your discussion with Michael.\nJ. Scott Kirby\nOkay. I got it. No, I'm saying I'm not sure, but I think there are 8 markets that didn't have nonstop service before. Some of which started now. Some of which start in June. And yes, some of those markets will have a little bit of spool-up. But these are more business-oriented markets, so the spool-up will be pretty small -- will be pretty quick.\nOperator\nDan Fintzen, please go ahead.\nDavid E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division\nJust a follow-up on some of the leisure commentary. Just curious as some of the relative outperformance in business. Is that reflective of what you think is going on in the broader economy in terms of corporate profits are high and maybe your overall economy is not as good, or is that just a product of years of capacity discipline, where leisure starts to get priced down become a smaller portion of vehicle of your revenue?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nWell, my opinion's no better than yours, but my view is that it's the former. It's more reflective of strong corporate profit and business in the United States and businesses that are doing well in the U.S. Leisure demand and leisure revenues are still growing, and they're still growing faster than GDP. So I don't think by any stretch of the imagination that consumers are getting priced out of air travel. It's just that business is growing stronger. And in that regard, I'd also say that if you look at inflation and adjusted fares from the time of deregulation, there's today about 50% below where they were in 1980. So air travel remains a fantastic bargain, and I don't see any evidence that we're pricing consumers out of the market, and demand remains strong and again is growing faster than GDP.\nDavid E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division\nAnd then just -- I mean, on that cyclical side, in the past, the booking curve, again, the leisure side may have been a little shorter than historical, and there's maybe a little more certainty in the economy. Are you seeing anything change there, or is it been pretty stable recently?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nI think it's stable there. And the booking curve movement, I think, are less about changes from a consumer psychology perspective and more about changes to airline fare structures. The booking curve moved in because airlines took what used to be a 21-day advance purchase fare with Saturday night stay required and made it a 0-day advance purchase fare one-way ticket. And so because of that, you move the booking curve as opposed to some structural change in consumer psychology.\nOperator\nMoving on, let's go to Jeff Kauffman.\nJeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division\nI just wanted to follow-up on Mike and Glenn's question on the 4 core hubs. We were talking about some of the differences you were seeing. Could you give us a feel for how the RASMs may have differed amongst the hubs in the quarter? It's just different trends, you don't have to get specific about exactly what they were. You would -- the business markets...\nJ. Scott Kirby\nWell, all did well. And on a year-over-year basis, in the first quarter Charlotte and Philly did the best, but that's largely driven by higher mix of business traffic. As we look forward, Phoenix is actually doing better. But they're all pretty similar.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Michael Derchin.\nMichael W. Derchin - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division\nJust one final -- again related to the profitability of your 4 key cities. You mentioned that Washington in national is very profitable, nicely profitable, and certainly upside coming from the swap. How do you rank those 4 in terms of profitability? Is Washington the most profitable? And what is Philly and Charlotte and Phoenix rank?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nIn terms of profit margin, DCA is typically our highest market, Charlotte is #2, and then Philly and Phoenix are all -- are very similar.\nMichael W. Derchin - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And in terms of just the upside potential of the 4?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nI think they all have upside potential.\nMichael W. Derchin - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division\nSimilar?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nYes.\nOperator\nJamie Baker, your line is open.\nJamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nQuick follow-up question for Scott. You did $345 million of other revenue in the first quarter. You're guiding to only $340 million of other revenue in the second quarter, despite the fact that sequentially, you're going to carry more passengers, you're going to have materially higher ASMs. You're entitled to your guidance. I'm just wondering if there's something structurally taking place that would imply lower other revenue collection per passenger. Or I just want to make sure there hasn't been an accounting change that is flipping some of what used to be other up in the passenger RASM, which might explain that 9% figure that you gave for April.\nJ. Scott Kirby\nJamie, it's really in the -- right now the difference is in the Dividend Miles that we had about $90 million in first quarter and Dividend Miles, and we don't expect that. We have some benefits early on where people renewed and things like that. That we don't expect going into the second, third and fourth quarter. I think from a baggage perspective, it's pretty equal all the way across and in-flight revenue equal all the way across. So the real difference right now is in the Dividend Miles section. Hopefully, we do better than that, as we go forward in the forecast. But right now, that's the area that is reduced going into the second, third and fourth quarter.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen we are now done taking questions from analysts at this time. [Operator Instructions] Josh Freed, your line is open.\nJoshua Freed\nAll right. Back at the time of the merger, there was some financing, I believe, from Airbus. Is that -- has that long since gone away? And what's the nature of your relationship with Airbus today? Is it -- obviously, you guys are an Airbus customer. Is there anything more to it than that? Or has it gone back to being just a fairly basic airline relationship with a Airbus supplier?\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nI wouldn't call it basic. We're the largest -- we fly more Airbus aircraft around than any other airline in the world, so we have a really -- we have a very good relationship. They do a nice job for us. But as it relates -- is there anything else in there? Yes, I mean, we have \u2013 I'll let Derek chime in, but I know really what we did was some things that we are paying back over time, and I assume we still have something to pay back. Go ahead, Derek.\nDerek J. Kerr\nNo, I think, we -- back in 2008, we raised a couple of hundred million dollars over that timeframe, and we're paying that back as some of that is paid back this year, about $78 million are in this year's guidance from a cash perspective. And then we do have some more to pay back in 2015, '16 and '17, but we have paid back already a significant portion of what we borrowed in 2008, but we do have a little bit more to pay down in 2015, '16 and '17. And then, of course, we have the order that we'll still be going on through taking deliveries through 2014 and then A350s start to show up in '17 -- 2017, '18 and '19. So significant relationship with Airbus and a really good relationship with them.\nJoshua Freed\nSure, sure. Obviously, sitting here today, your orders are all Airbus as opposed to Boeing. And is that a requirement of any of those relationships, or is it just simply the...\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nThat's really not. No.\nOperator\nNext up, let's go to Mary Schlangenstein.\nMary Schlangenstein\nI had 2 really quick questions. The first one, Doug, when you and Scott talked about looking at that $800 million difference to bring American labor costs down to industry consensus, American is now saying, that it's $990 million, only when you count unions. Does that make any difference at all in terms of your forecast of the numbers that you guys have worked with?\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nYes. Okay, fair enough. I mean, you're asking about -- made his clarifications. We used that number, because its American's number to provide people some idea as to what we -- the impact on our synergies. So if they said that number's different, no, it doesn't make any difference to. The important number that Scott disclosed, which is that conservatively we know what we have agreed to and what it would do to the total cost structure of the combined airlines. And we believe that conservatively, having done that we still are able to produce -- we still would be able to produce the airlines together conservatively, $1.2 billion of synergies.\nMary Schlangenstein\nOkay. My other quick question was, Derek, on the $100 million loan that you talked about, can you give any more specific details on that?\nDerek J. Kerr\nWe can't get any more color on it. It will be in our Q. It will be -- the information will be in the Q. But as I said, I can give you that it was a 2-year deal, standalone credit facility and just used the collateral that you'll recall back in December we put out $47 million to reacquire the legal title of those slots. So we just refinanced those slots.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Let's next go to Ted Reed.\nTed Reed\nMy questions are all for Scott on international. First, Delta said that counter intuitively despite the European economies, they see a lot of growth in business traffic to Europe. Do you see the same thing?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nWe do.\nTed Reed\nAll right. I'll move to the next question. The recent agreements with Brazil, when the negotiators were here, is that increasing your chance of getting the say, Apollo route from Charlotte more quickly?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nWell, we've already got the authority to fly in S\u00e3o Paulo, so we're working with the regulators in S\u00e3o Paulo on issues like getting appropriate slot times, getting a place to park our airplane. So directly, the answer is probably no. But a better government to government relationship, where the industry is good helping smooth out some of those issues.\nTed Reed\nOkay. And third thing I heard you -- last thing, I heard you mention Asia. What would be the most likely hub from which you would serve Asia?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nPhiladelphia.\nOperator\nAnd the question is now from Ely Portillo.\nEly Portillo\nI'm just wondering if you can give any color about Charlotte, Douglas. And whether you expect any large changes in traffic there this year? And also whether you guys have any concerns similar to Philly over the expansion plans that are being talked about and decided on by Jerry Orr and his crew over there?\nJ. Scott Kirby\nCharlotte is a fantastic hub for us, one that we've actually grown quite a bit over the last few years. We think there continues to be opportunities to grow, add more small cities in particular to Charlotte. We've got Charlotte-S\u00e3o Paulo service on the plate, so it can be international growth as well. And as to the airport relationship there, we have a fantastic relationship with Jerry Orr and his team. I wish all of our airport relationships everywhere in the world could be as good, and we're supportive of what they're doing.\nOperator\nWith that, we'll conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'll turn the conference back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.\nWilliam Douglas Parker\nOkay, great. Thanks a lot. One thing I do want to close with -- Derek's sitting here next to me, just wanted to note -- I noted how great the entire team of 32,000 employees has been doing but our management team has gotten some nice awards of late, that's what I wanted to out to point you. \nDerek was in New York this week being on his -- the treasury team, being honored by Airfinance Journal as the Treasury Team of the Year. I told you on the last call that our Investor Relations team, which is a team of one led by Dan Cravens was honored by Institutional Investor as the investor relations -- as the Best Investor Relations team in the business. \nWe also had something we're extremely proud of and just during this quarter, our team was named the 2012 Maintenance Organization of the Year by Aviation Week. So anyway, these are the kind of things you usually see the fourth largest airline winning all these awards. But we're doing it because we have a phenomenal team, and we're really proud of them. So I just want to point that to you guys as well. \nAnyway, thanks very much for your time. Thanks very much for your understanding and cooperation in the Q&A period. We appreciate it. We will be in touch and let you know more as it develops. Thanks a lot.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, we again conclude today's conference call. Thank you very much for your participation.\n\n",

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of results for the first quarter of FY \u201815. As you can see in the press release, FedEx is off to a good start for the fiscal year thanks to the strong performance of Ground, solid volume and revenue increases at Freight and volume and yield growth at Express. We expect continued revenue and earnings growth in FY \u201815, assuming moderate global economic growth and stable fuel prices.\nIt's clear more customers are relying on FedEx because they appreciate the competitive advantages provided by our portfolio of solutions. FedEx Ground's performance was driven primarily by higher average daily volume as a result of increasing eCommerce. At FedEx Freight, increased revenue per shipment and strong LTL shipment growth drove operating margins higher. FedEx Express' operating income and margin improved, and we are confident we will achieve our profit improvement program goals. Now, let me turn the call over to Mike Glenn for his thoughts on the economy, after which Alan Graf will provide more detail on the first quarter earnings. Mike?\nMike Glenn\nThank you, Fred, and good morning. With private sector demand accelerating and fiscal austerity winding down, our expectation for real GDP growth is to average around 3% for the remainder of this year and next. Our US GDP forecast is now 2.1% for calendar 2014 and 3.1% for calendar 2015. We have increased our expectations for industrial production growth to 4.1% this year and 3.8% in calendar 2015.\nThe global economy has improved, although it certainly remains a multi-speed world. The US is leading the way and emerging markets are picking up. We expect global growth of 2.6% in calendar 2014 and 3.1% for calendar 2015.\nNow, let me make a few comments regarding the Company's yield performance. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year express domestic yield increased 0.5% in the first quarter. This increase was driven by product mix and rate and discount. The ground package yield increased 3% year-over-year in the first quarter, excluding the impact of fuel. The ground yield has improved steadily due to rate and discount and product mix.\nExcluding fuel, international export express package yield increased 1.9%, which was primarily driven by product mix. And finally, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per shipment increased 1.2% at FedEx Freight, which was driven by rate and discount and changes in weight per shipment.\nAs noted in the press Release, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will be increasing shipping rates an average of 4.9% effective January 5 of 2015. FedEx Ground will also be implementing the new dimensional weight policy previously announced to include packages less than 3 cubic feet, which will also be effective on January 5.\nAnd finally, just a couple comments on peak season. We're expecting another record peak season in terms of delivery volume. Peak will once again be compressed this year with Cyber Monday falling on December 1. We've been in active dialogue with our retail and etail customers all year to understand their peak shipping needs and plan our operations accordingly.\nWe expect more than 50,000 seasonal positions to be added for the upcoming peak across the FedEx operating companies. This includes package handler, helpers, drivers and other support positions. Based upon our growth expectations and network expansion, the majority of those seasonal workers will have the opportunity to continue working for us after the holiday season. So, now let me turn it over to Alan Graf for a few comments.\nAlan Graf\nThank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. We had an outstanding first quarter with EPS of $2.10 a share and 8.5% operating margin. Revenue growth from increased volumes and yields drove a significant increase in earnings for each of our transportation segments. Our sales team is executing on improved revenue quality strategy at a very high level.\nIn Q1, we repurchased 5.3 million shares of FedEx common stock and completed the share repurchase program that we announced in FY \u201814. The repurchase program had a $0.15 per share year-over-year positive impact on our EPS this quarter. To improve the transparency of our results, this year we ceased allocating the costs associated with our corporate headquarters division to our transportation segments. These costs are now included in corporate, eliminations and other in our segment reporting and reconciliations. A reserve for a legal contingency was recorded at corporate in Q1, causing the increase in these unallocated costs versus the prior year.\nLooking at our segments, at Express, operating income increased 35% and operating margin increased 130 basis points. Revenue growth in our US and international export package business drove higher income, partially offset by higher maintenance expense and lower freight revenues. The profit improvement programs also contributed to the improvement in operating income for Express.\nUS domestic volumes increased 5% in Q1, driven by both overnight box and deferred service offerings. International economy volumes increased 3%. International priority volumes were up 1%. Overall, international export revenue per package increased 3%.\nTurning to Ground. Average daily volume increased 6% during the quarter from continued growth in our home delivery service and commercial business. Smart Post average daily volume was down 10% due to lower volume from a major customer; however, Smart Post revenue per package increased 10% from rate increases and improved customer mix, partially offset by higher postage costs. Volumes increased 8%, excluding the changes in shipping patterns from a major customer.\nGround segment operating income increased 13% and operating margin increased to 18.4% on higher revenue per package and volumes. Higher network expansion costs partially offset Ground's increase in operating income as we continue to invest in the high margin, high ROIC growing Ground businesses.\nAt Freight, it was a great quarter, with operating margin of 10.4%, up 340 basis points from last year. Operating income and operating margin increased from higher less than truckload revenue per shipment, higher average daily LTL shipments and solid cost management. Freight saw higher demand for both its priority and economy service offerings in the quarter, which drove an 11% increase in average daily LTL shipments.\nTurning to our outlook, and based on the economic outlook that Mike talked about, we reaffirm our FY \u201815 earnings per share forecast of $8.50 to $9 a share. Our outlook depends on key external factors, including fuel prices and the pace of improvement in the global economy. Revenue and earnings are expected to continue \u2013 revenue and earnings growth are expected to continue into the second quarter and the remainder of FY \u201815, driven by ongoing improvements at all of our operating companies, along with continued volume and yield improvements.\nProfit improvement programs that we announced in FY \u201813 will add to our FY \u201815 results as we continue to execute on them. FY \u201815 will see the full benefit of a voluntary buyout program which was completed in May. We should also see additional cost savings from sourcing and procurement. Every new 767 replacement aircraft should add about $10 million annually to profits. We have 4 767s in service currently and expect to have another 12 delivered by the end of FY \u201815.\nThere are many other initiatives that we are working on at Express. In short, we are progressing as planned with the profit improvement programs. We had an excellent quarter, and we are looking forward to a very good year. Now, we will open up the call for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions]\nWe'll take our first question from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.\nRob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nHi, good morning. How are you doing, guys?\nFred Smith\nGood.\nRob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nAlan, I'll let someone else have at the guidance given the strong results in the first quarter, and I'll direct this question to you, Fred.\nI'm trying to think about the significant growth that the industry keeps talking about in terms of wide bodied passenger aircraft and how you guys think about your aircraft renewal opportunity, given the incremental capacity that's coming on and your experiences using third party line haul to date in the international economy package? And your thoughts in terms of where these aircraft are going to be coming on in different lanes, if that provides you the opportunity to potentially reduce the asset intensiveness of the aircraft fleet over time?\nFred Smith\nWell, I think it's early. It's 1 quarter. Our guidance does show 26% to 33% increase in EPS, which is a little bit less than the first quarter or the second half will be a little bit tougher comparison as we really start to hit our stride in the second half of FY \u201814. I'm comfortable with where we are now, and we'll talk about it again in December.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.\nFred Smith\nLet me go in and answer the question that was just answered \u2013 just asked before, before you make the question about the fleet planning. Dave will put some color on this, but basically, our strategy is to have an unparalleled proprietary priority network, and then we do use the underbellies, as you mentioned, for our economy service. And we are very cognizant of the lift that's out there, that's planned to be out there and it's very sophisticated planning process that goes into it that determines what sort of aircraft that we acquire.\nNow, having said that, I think Alan's made this point. We're not buying any airplanes other than to modernize our fleet. And these airplanes are very profit accretive, as Alan mentioned to you, and the 777s in the international business are just unprecedented in the type of operating capabilities and competitive advantage we have. So, let me turn it over to Dave to put more color on it.\nDave Bronczek\nThanks, Fred. It's a great question. Our 777s provide us the global powerhouse that FedEx Express is the best in the world. We have the latest cutoff times and the earliest arrival times all over the world coming out of Asia, into the United States into the Middle East, into Europe.\nThe 777s are replacing the MD11s. The MD11s are coming back to the United States. The 767s are actually replacing, as Fred pointed out, older used airplanes that we're getting tremendous fuel efficiency, operating efficiency, maintenance efficiency out of the 767s back here in the United States. The combination of both of these planes into our fleet has provided us a tremendous opportunity to grow our profits and improve our service around the world.\nFred Smith\nNow that other question.\nOperator\nFrom Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.\nBen Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.\nHi, good morning, guys. Alan, could I get your perspective on \u2013 piggybacking on that, to the extent that CapEx is going to remain focused on fleet replacement and not growth and you guys continue to execute on this plan within Express. Clearly, you have the cash flow capability coming, you're done with the buyback. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about managing excess cash going forward between the dividend and a potential new share repurchase authorization? Thanks.\nAlan Graf\nI don't have anything to say today about new share repurchase authorization other than the fact that we talk about this at every single Board meeting and we will continue to do that. We have stated that we want to continue to increase our dividend.\nWe understand our dividend yield is sub par. Part of that is because of the outstanding stock performance. But we will continue to increase our dividends at some level as our strategy and objective, and so we'll see where we get. We're very pleased with the stock buyback program that we recently executed, and we will keep our eye on that as well, but that's a Board decision.\nOperator\nThank you. We'll go next to Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup\nGreat, thanks, good morning. Wanted to touch a little bit on the pricing environment. When you think about turning the page into calendar 2014 with dimensional pricing coming in and obviously, the GRIs announced last night, some of them were a bit higher than last year, LTLs a little bit faster than the annual cycle. Just wanted to get a rough sense when you think about across the spectrum of your products and capacity being a little bit tighter, how should we be thinking about the pricing environment as it sets up for calendar 2015?\nAlan Graf\nWell, FedEx bases all pricing decisions on current market conditions, the economic environment and things of that nature, and we feel the changes that we put in place are appropriate. They allow us to continue to invest in the value that we're providing our customers. And of course, always, our objective is to strike the right balance between yield improvement and volume growth to contribute to the bottom line, and I think we have successfully done that.\nThat's really the backdrop on which all these pricing decisions are made, and we feel very comfortable with the announcement yesterday. We think it's appropriate given the market conditions and the economic environment. And again, our sales team is executing very crisply on the strategy to strike that right balance.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Banc of America Merrill Lynch.\nKen Hoexter \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch\nGreat, good morning. Solid start on the year here. Can you just talk about the progress of maybe some of the expense cost reductions in the profit improvement plan in terms of the SG&A and the progress of the facility, some reallocation you had talked about or consolidations? And then, did you mention there was a one-time charge within the corporate allocation? Can you delve on that too? Thanks.\nAlan Graf\nWell, Ken, I'll start and I'll turn it over to Dave. I'm very pleased with where we are on our cost reduction program. We are basically exceeding it in every category. Had we not done what we did, our costs would have been significantly higher this quarter than they were and our earnings would have been a lot lower.\nI'm also proud of the fact that we've done it and we still have been able to maintain and increase our service levels and not give up on that, which is a very integral part of what we try to do every day. We will continue to work hard on that. We continue to find additional opportunities everywhere. Everyone is focused on it. We know we have a profit improvement program to hit but also, I think we are getting to world class in terms of cost management, in terms of our management. So, I'm going to turn it over to Dave.\nDave Bronczek\nThanks, Alan. Yes, I'm extremely proud of our Express team. Around the world, they've executed flawlessly. As has been mentioned twice already, we're on plan, projected to be on target. For the run out rate in FY \u201815 we had a solid quarter, and going forward, we are expecting the same kinds of results in terms of exceeding our plan.\nOn top of that, I wanted to say that in terms of the parts of the profit improvement plan, you mentioned the voluntary buyout, the SG&A. We're 100% in on that already, so that's already rolling into FY \u201815. Our fleet modernization is rolling out as we had planned, and as Alan pointed out, probably ahead of plan in many, if not all, of these categories. We have our focus and we have our eyes set on achieving those kinds of results going forward. We know what's expected, and our team is executing.\nAlan Graf\nWe did take a legal reserve at corporate in the first quarter, and it was for an immaterial amount.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie Capital.\nKelly Dougherty \u2013 Macquarie Capital\nGood morning, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the pricing question earlier, especially in light of what we've seen from the post office recently. I guess two things.\nHow do you help us think about the magnitude of the yield impact from the price increases and the dim weight changes? And then just some thoughts on what you think about the move by the post office to aggressively cut price to gain share and how that plays into your market share strategy and the outlook for margins at Ground?\nAlan Graf\nWell, first, let me say, we don't comment on specific pricing actions by our competitors. We make all of our pricing decisions independent, based upon market conditions and economic conditions, as I mentioned earlier.\nHaving said that, we have a tremendous portfolio of services which allow us to effectively serve the eCommerce market. I think we've demonstrated the ability to develop a strategy that really targets the right kind of growth within the eCommerce segment that contributes to the bottom line and supports our yield strategy. So, we're very comfortable with our strategy there. We're very comfortable with our growth opportunities there.\nRegarding the specific impact of decisions like dimensional weight, it would be extremely difficult to speculate on the impact of that because we're working with customers right now to alter their packaging so that they have more efficient packaging, which is good for sustainability and certainly fits with our corporate social responsibility programs. As those changes are made, and let me remind you, we announced that change 6 months early to give customers plenty of time to respond to that, and many are taking advantage of our packaging lab to redesign packaging to be more efficient, which we like. So, at this stage, it would be impossible to speculate on that, but let me just say, we're very comfortable with our position going forward.\nHenry Maier\nHi, Kelly, this is Henry Maier. Ground margins in the first quarter were reflective of better revenue quality, cost control, and ensuring every package was in the right network. We expect to continue to deliver industry-leading margins and as I've told you on this call before, the Ground team would not be satisfied with anything less than margins in the high teens.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.\nThanks, good morning. Just following up on that last point, in the Ground margins, very nice revenue growth. Pretty consistent with what we were expecting, but those margins were nice. You just hit a few of the areas. I know there is some OpEx going on with network expansion. Was there any change to \u2013 in ebb or flow in the quarter, and how do you anticipate that going forward as an impact on margins? Thanks.\nHenry Maier\nWell, I don't think there was any change. We expect to spend roughly $1.2 billion in CapEx this year, 85%, 90% is all for capacity. We are right on plan in terms of our plans to bring those new facilities on. And I think as we said in the past, we manage roughly 150 real estate projects a year in anticipation of peak.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.\nBill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nHi there, good morning. Mike, can I ask you about the international side? We saw the package volumes turn up a bit. In your experience, do product launches like iPhone 6 or these sorts of things have a material effect on that part of the business for FedEx? Or is it that this is just an iteration of a new product so it wouldn't have the same kind of effect that we've seen in the past?\nMike Glenn\nBill, it has some impact, but more in the area that it relates to, our FedEx Trade Networks Company. There's been a change in the way companies position inventory for product launches. There's much more forward deployment of that inventory, using forwarding capacity to stage product in the US. And then we work with companies to then deploy the product to either retail locations or individual consumers. So, those product launches are now more likely to show up in the domestic businesses, and they really are surges. They are 1 to 2 day surges now, based upon the product launch.\nNow, having said all that, there is the after market effect of accessories and things of that nature which do flow through the system but don't have the impact of the product launch itself in terms of number of units. You really need to think \u2013 rethink the way those \u2013 or think differently about those product launches now as much more, the product is forward deployed.\nFred Smith\nThis is Fred Smith. We've got a couple of questions over the internet. One from Art Hatfield with Raymond James. How should we think about margin goals for Express, given the change corporate cost allocation? I don't think that the latter has much effect on what our goal is. Our goal is to have all 3 of our major transport sectors operating at double-digit margins, and we're confident that we can do so. Obviously in this quarter, we had 2 out of the 3, but significant progress at Express.\nAnother question from Shelby Holiday at Bloomberg. In addition to adding seasonal employees, what else is FedEx doing to ensure a smooth peak season 2014? I think if we answered that question fully, we would spend the next 2 hours talking to you about it. The peak planning begins in January/February each year, after peak season.\nThere are just scores of things that are done at each of the FedEx operating companies to accommodate a smooth peak season. Contrary to some of the popular press, we actually had an outstanding peak season last year, with the exception of a couple of weather events. And the CEOs have reported at DSMC that they're prepared for peak season this year and hopefully, the weather will be accommodating.\nThere's a question about the long-term strategy for handling the shift to B2C. I think Mike Glenn answered that, quite frankly. We've done a great job of understanding what parts of the B2C business make sense and that are profitable We've got a broad portfolio of solutions, our customers want to buy it \u2013 these solutions and in great profusion.\nAnd then entry into emerging markets, of course, as you know, we bought a wonderful company in Mexico. We bought a great company in Brazil. We have an outstanding operation in India. We have an excellent domestic operation in China and recently received, after a long delay, the licenses to continue to grow that business. So, we have a major focus on emerging markets as well. So, we'll now take other questions from the moderator.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.\nAllison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse\nThanks, good morning. In response to an earlier question on returns to shareholders, the dividend hike and a potential buyback and that you are consistently talking about it at the Board meetings, I was just wondering if you could just remind us when the next Board meeting will take place?\nAlan Graf\nAllison, our annual meeting is a week from Monday.\nAllison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research\nThanks, good morning guys. Alan, one of the questions earlier about the profit improvement plan, I think you said that you're now tracking ahead of the plan or something to that effect. And that seems to be a change from some of the commentary you were giving last year, and so I want to understand that a little bit more in terms of what's changing to give you confidence that you're now above plan? Is it additional costs that you're finding? Is it maybe you think pricing could become a bigger part of this? Or what is really driving the confidence that you now can be better than the $1.6 billion?\nAlan Graf\nScott, I think what I said was on the cost side, we were ahead. There's still a long way to go here, and we just reported a 5.4% margin. We've got a long way to go to hit this profit improvement plan. I'm very pleased on the cost side. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I'm extremely pleased with our execution of our improved revenue quality strategy, which we've all talked about and continue to talk about on these calls and are working very hard inside the Company. We need to get paid adequately for the services that we're providing.\nWe have stabilized the Express network, we're not expanding it. And we are continuing to work to improve the revenue quality on those international flights, which is a key part of our profit improvement program. But it's also probably one of the hardest parts of the profit improvement program, because we don't see the global trade situation today as we did in October of 2012 when we announced the program. We're doubling down on everything else, and I'm very confident on the cost side. I am confident that we are on track at the PIP, but we've got 7 more quarters ahead of us.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nThomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs\nThanks. Can you talk a little bit more about the state of international express markets by region? We're seeing Asia seemingly rebounding nicely; Europe is much more mixed, and some of the data actually looks like it's rolling over. And if you could comment to what extent you're seeing different commodities drive the growth, that would also be appreciated.\nFor the two, one of the earlier questions, to what extent is the tech launches that we're seeing driving the growth, and do you think that there's anything beyond tech that's going to sustain the growth? And I appreciate your comment that it's \u2013 I'm referring to comments from perhaps other companies that continuously refer to the rebound, particularly out of Asia, about tech launches driving some of the growth that some of your peers have been seeing, thanks.\nDave Bronczek\nThis is Dave Bronczek. I'll let Mike go back and talk about the tech launches, but in terms of our regions around the world, they've all performed very well. As you pointed out, Asia Pacific rebounded nicely. For us, Europe is performing very well. We've opened up 109 stations in the last 2 years, and the business is performing exactly as we had hoped it would. And I think around the world, we're very pleased with the progress we're making. I do think Alan's point is right. The global economy is still probably softer than we would like to see it; but that being said, we're performing well in it.\nOn the international revenue side, our yields are strong and our volume is strong, especially in our box volume. It's also strong in our domestic business. Our box volume and overnight box is up 9%. Deferred boxes are up 7%. The overnight letters are \u2013 is what's down slightly. When you look at our mix of products and our drivers of profit improvement, that's all benefiting us.\nI should add 1 other thing. One that you can see and one that you can't see, probably. In aircraft maintenance, it's a timing issue for us. And you can see that it's our number 1 expense item in terms of incremental expense year-over-year. On fuel, and we talk about fuel all the time, and I know you all do, it was slightly positive, it was not material, and I think that's important to note.\nMike Glenn\nLet me comment again, just to make sure there's a clear understanding of my comments regarding product launches. Over the last couple of years, there has been a change in the strategy regarding product launches. This is not a FedEx strategy; let me be clear, this is a market strategy.\nMore of these companies are electing to build time into their product launch planning to allow them to take advantage of more traditional freight networks to forward deploy the product and move the product into the United States or other markets and stage that inventory for the launch itself. That is changing the mix of traffic. And this is not only affecting FedEx, it's affecting the entire transportation market in terms of how this product is forward deployed. So, I want to make sure I'm clear about that.\nNow, having said all that, once the product launch occurs, then other inventory moves through more traditional channels and specifically, accessories moves through more traditional channels. The real impact of the change in product launches is a removal from the international perspective of the large bubble that took place early in the product launch cycle, and that has now smoothed out quite a bit.\nThe bubble then takes place as a result of that, for example, in the US, when the product starts moving through the US network to achieve, advance or to fulfill advance orders, either through the retail stores or direct to individuals. It has been a change in strategy by the companies that are launching these products. And obviously, we're responding well, and we are very comfortable with our position because of the portfolio of services that we provide.\nJust quickly, you asked about the segments that were driving international growth. These are typically consumer-driven services, manufacturing durables, of which these high-tech products would be part of that. Those are the areas where we see a lot of growth, and wholesale durables as well.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays Capital\nYes, good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the good quarter. I think this question is going to be for Fred or Mike. We talk a lot about trying to shape customer behavior with the dim weight change, trying to get smaller boxes into the system. But wouldn't one of the best levers be some form of realtime pricing where you can really start to manage the peaks and valleys in the network? And what's really limiting the industry from shifting to more of a realtime pricing model?\nMike Glenn\nWell, again, we work with our customers very specifically about the pricing that they have on a contractual basis, based upon the forecasted demand and the volume that they anticipate. That's one reason why January \u2013 excuse me, December 26th we start focusing on the next year for peak season. When we go into a contractual negotiation with a customer, if that customer has a peaking factor, for example, of 3 times, that would imply that they will give us about 3 times as much volume, for example, in the month of December that they would the other 11 months.\nThat information is known on the front end, and our negotiations are based upon that. This is not a situation where we get surprised by the lumpiness, if you will, of a customer's volume. We know that going into a negotiation. Obviously, we won't rule out other pricing tactics. We announced a change to our dim weight policy based upon the change in market conditions and the economic environment, and I'm sure there will be future changes along those lines.\nBut I want to be real clear, we have a great deal of understanding and data to support pricing decision and contractual negotiations based upon the forecasted volume that customers give us. A lot of our discounts are also volume based, so if the volume goes up or down, we adjust those discounts accordingly. There's a tremendous amount of science that goes into revenue management, and we are world class at that. Our pricing science group is outstanding. And that's really one of the reasons why that data feeds our growth strategy and that's one of the reasons why we've been able to sustain a balance between volume growth and yield improvements contributed to bottom line expansion.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman from Buckingham Research.\nJeff Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research Group\nThank you very much and congratulations. Alan, I just wanted to take 10 steps back here. You raised your global IP outlook, you had a very strong quarter. Fuel prices seem to be a little bit better, costs ahead of plan, yet the guidance remains in line. Can you help me connect the dots on that?\nAlan Graf\nWell, when I gave you this guidance at the end of last year, we had factored all that into the guidance. As I said, we were very pleased with the first quarter, second half is a little bit tougher. I have no idea about peak season weather yet, which could swing us quite a bit. As I said, we'll have more to say about this at the end of December when we have that basically mostly behind us, and we'll see where that is.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein Research.\nDavid Vernon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.\nThanks for taking the question. Mike, a question for you on the domestic yields. David mentioned that the box volume was up 9%. That's the best quarterly figure that I can see back in my model.\nAnd I was just trying to get a sense for what the underlying rate development was and what you think is really driving that, whether it's macro, maybe response to lower prices. Any other shifts that are going in there to drive the outstanding volume growth in overnight box?\nMike Glenn\nThere are a couple issues that are in play here. One is Express is certainly benefiting from the growth of eCommerce, which we've said previously on this call. Secondarily, as part of profit improvement plan, Dave Bronczek and I, along with our teams, have really developed a targeted growth strategy that is targeting specific amounts of growth opportunities at targeted yields which we feel, if we're able to achieve that, is going to benefit his bottom line. And our sales team is executing that strategy perfectly. So, Dave and I work very closely together, we monitor all the opportunities, all the pipelines to make sure that we're achieving our desired goals. And again, hats off to our sales team for executing that strategy.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Bruce Chen with Stifel.\nBruce Chen \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus\nYes, thank you gentlemen. You alluded to another compressed peak season in your prepared remarks. I'm wondering with what's going on over on the West Coast with the ILWU, it seems that a lot of shippers have been prepositioning inventory, and I don't just mean tech product launches here. I'd like to get your view on whether that should affect your volumes going into peak and as far as last minute inventory supplements, whether that's been a factor in your preparations. Thank you.\nMike Glenn\nThis is Mike again. It's certainly an issue that we're monitoring, but I would say at this stage, based upon the feedback from our customers, we don't expect that to have a material impact on our peak season at this point.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from David Campbell with Thompson Davis & Company.\nDavid Campbell \u2013 Thompson Davis & Company\nYes, thanks for taking the question. I \u2013 some of the international companies see China as more of an import freight business, much more of an import business than an export business as it has been for the last 10 years. Do you see the same thing going on there? And of course, that import business has a lot to do with the intra Asia growth. Just wondering how you were positioning the Company to participate in that growth.\nDave Bronczek\nThis is Dave Bronczek. As you know, we've been in China for over 2 decades now, and we've had \u2013 3 decades now. We've had growth in our international segment and that continues to grow; the 777s continue to add more value to customers all around the world with later cutoffs there in China, feeding the rest of the world. We have an excellent intra Asia network off of our hub in Guangzhou, China, and then we have a domestic business in China.\nSo, we're actually playing in and succeeding in every segment of the Chinese marketplace. And thankfully, we've been in business there for a long time and have a great reputation and great management team. And so to your question, we're seeing international export growth, we're seeing domestic intra-region growth and domestic China growth.\nAlan Graf\nThis is Alan, I have a question from Ryan Novak from Citadel about the $35 million year-over-year increase in the new corporate eliminations and the other line. That is largely the result of the legal reserve that we took. We are being maniacal about our corporate headquarters costs and trying to keep them down, which is why we are now reporting it separately so that we can show you transparency on the progress we have there as well. Sometimes those costs tend to get lost in chargebacks, and now we are focused on it.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question come from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie Capital.\nKelly Dougherty \u2013 Macquarie Capital\nThanks. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the pace of trade down from priority to economy and how it might differ domestically versus internationally. Do you think we've hit a point where there's stabilization? Maybe the delta between the 2 has leveled out at a good level that we can assume going forward? And then how are you assuming this trend as part of the Express profit improvement plan?\nDave Bronczek\nWell, this is Dave Bronczek. I'll start off, and then Mike can add some color. What we feel at Express in that FedEx is the same trend and the same way of business conducted around the world as it is in the United States.\nPeople look for different means of transportation, and we have them all at FedEx in our portfolio. So, we're not surprised. We're actually right in line. We've actually tweaked our model, if you will, so we can take advantage of the global economic activity in the deferred space, and that's performing well for us. In the Express overnight space, very much like the United States, we think the global marketplace is the same.\nMike Glenn\nYes, and let me just say, our mission is to work with customers to deliver solutions to them, leveraging the entire bundle of services that we provide in order to deliver the value that they need to improve their performance. So when they win, we win. We really look for opportunities to work with customers to make their supply chains as efficient as possible.\nA lot of the transition has occurred. Would I say it's over? No. Customers are always looking for ways to tweak their supply chains but clearly, we've seen \u2013 I think the economic situation starting in 2008 drove a lot of that. Obviously, as the economy improves, I think you'll probably see less focus on that and hopefully more focus on growth from our customers. But clearly, they will continue to look to refine their supply chains.\nFred Smith\nLet me just add a point to this, because I believe this has been an area of confusion on the part of a lot of people for a long time. What drives the selection of Express over Ground is not the fact that there's a Ground alternative and Express alternative. It's the nature of the product being shipped and the need of the shipper that's making the transaction. So, a defibrillator going for an operation is going to go Express. The plug-in to \u2013 of a charger for a new product that might be introduced by the electronics industry is almost certainly going to go Ground.\nAs the market grows, there is a percentage of the traffic by virtue of the nature of the product and the consequences of the item being delivered in a short time will pay Express rates for Express service. And for some reason, several years ago, there was a large body of thought that everything was going to go Ground. We tried to tell people that that wasn't the case, and I think that what you see in the marketplace now is a more stable picture as some of this trade down has occurred, as Mike mentioned.\nBut there is a certain percentage of the parcel traffic and the freight traffic, whether it's international, domestic, it's going to go Express. And we have the greatest Express Company in the world, and we've mentioned over and over again, we intend to get the Express Company back up to earning at the level that it should.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.\nKeith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar\nComments on the call sound quite positive regarding international activity, and year-over-year comps and international volume and yield are positive. You've mentioned you expect international trade to continue to grow faster, but I've also noted that Fred speaks a fair bit on risks of heightened protectionism. And I wonder if you're detecting some relief, or can you give insight into sources of expected trade despite these obstacles?\nFred Smith\nWell, you're correct. I think we had on the investor website several speeches I gave last spring. The reality is that perhaps the most important thing that's been done since the end of World War II was American leadership to open up markets and lift, literally, billions of people out of poverty. It's the American consumer, combined with the Chinese liberalization, that has created this incredible prosperity for millions and hundreds of millions of Chinese.\nIndia began to become more market oriented in the 1990s, Brazil did. But recently, as I point out in those speeches, there's been a real increase in the number of protectionist measures around the world and a lack of leadership on the part of the United States in moving towards more open markets.\nAs you know, there was just a very disappointing result in the negotiations that was, in essence, vetoed by India. And so the United States will have to resume that mantle of leadership, yet trade promotion authority really push these various initiatives that underway. There are 4 major initiatives that the treaty negotiations of the United States is involved in today. But absent that, I think you're going to see a very difficult environment for trade around the world if these protectionist measures continue to proliferate.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nThomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs\nThanks for letting me ask another question. Alan, I was wondering about the dividend side. Can you help us frame about how you're thinking about what would be deemed adequate? Are you thinking about more of a yield, or are you thinking about more of a payout ratio?\nAlan Graf\nBoth. I think we just need to continue to improve it until we get up into a range where people who are interested in dividends and dividend yields would be more interested in our shares than they are today. It's what Mickey is after me about every 5 minutes, so we'll continue to do that. I think every year for many a number of years now we've increased at our May/June Board meeting, and we'll take it up again this year.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research\nThanks for the follow-up. One for Henry on the Ground side. We saw margin expansion for the first time in a bunch quarters. Are you comfortable that we're through the overhang of the capital expansion cost and we can start seeing Ground margin improvement? And do you see any impact from the outcome in California on the contractor side that could lead to more legal costs or could lead you to change the contract remodel?\nHenry Maier\nWell, the answer to the first question is that we've probably got another year of increased capital before we're over the hump here in terms of the capacity that \u2013 or building out the capacity we view we need going forward in the network. Most of that expenditure is in the area of hubs and automated satellites. All of our hubs are automated.\nI think the thing that's important for the folks on the call to understand is we are expanding the footprint of our auto satellites pretty aggressively here because of the capacity it gives us, the flexibility it gives us. Particularly when we see volumes spike up at peak and the ability long term of those facilities to lower our costs, both in terms of lower line haul expense and fewer handlings. I think there's 1 more year here and then you'll see CapEx go back to something that we will consider to be, quote, normal, unquote. I'm going to let Chris answer the question on California.\nChris Richards\nHi, Scott. In light of legal and regulatory developments in several states, we've taken a number of steps in recent years to enhance the operating agreements with all of the independent businesses that contract with Ground to provide transportation services. These independent businesses agree to remain incorporated and in good standing in the states in which they do business and to treat their personnel as employees and to comply with all applicable Federal and State laws. That being said, we have announced we are transitioning to new independent service provider agreements in California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Banc of America Merrill Lynch.\nKen Hoexter \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch\nHi, great. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the charge that you mentioned before. Is that anything related to the California move to contractors as employees, or is that a completely separate? And being a large charge, can you maybe provide some details on that?\nChris Richards, FedEx Corporation - EVP, General Counsel & Secretary 76\nKen, it's Chris Richards. While we do not agree with the 9th Circuit decision, we have established an accrual for the estimated probable loss in these cases that was required to be recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standards.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.\nRob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank \nYes, thanks for the follow-up. Henry, just to piggyback on Scott's earlier question, with the changes that have been announced in California, should we be thinking about any sort of incremental cost to the Company as you execute there? Or can this be like some of the changes in the past where we actually saw margins expand due to efficiencies that you gained?\nHenry Maier\nWell, Rob, we've currently transitioned to 17 states. We don't expect any change here. Any additional costs we would see in terms of the transition would be immaterial. I guess the answer is no, I don't think you should read anything into this. In fact, if you look at the 17 states that we previously transitioned, our service actually improved, so no.\nOperator\nSeeing no further questions in queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mickey Foster for any additional or closing remarks.\nMickey Foster\nThank you for your participation in the FedEx Corporation's first quarter earnings release conference call. Feel free to call anyone on the Investor Relations team if you have additional questions about FedEx. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This will conclude today's conference.\n\n",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.\nRon Slaymaker\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year 2010 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. \nThis call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for March 8. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate with this update. \nIn today's call, we'll describe our views on the demand environment, where we are in the correction and our near-term outlook. We'll also talk about the financial impact of the three new factories that we have now brought online and the opportunities for growth that these factories provide. Finally, we'll provide a retrospective view of the year and our expectations for the years ahead. \nI'll start with the demand environment. As a reminder, from the second quarter of 2009 through the third quarter of 2010, the SC industry had six quarters of strong growth. Our own revenue in the third quarter of 2010 was up 79% from the first quarter 2009 trough. In the summer of 2010, the industry began to slow and then declined in the fourth quarter. During our October and December calls, we said that we believed the slowdown would be both short and shallow. We were in an environment where lead times were shortening and inventories were being quickly reduced. At this point, we believe the correction is mostly complete. \nTI's lead times have now completed an orderly reduction and are back to normal as we had projected in our last call. During the fourth quarter, we were able to replenish our inventory levels, which will help us keep lead times normal during 2011. \nRegarding customer and channel inventory, while there are some customer-specific examples where inventories are higher than they desire, we see some of the important end markets like PCs and LCD TVs having largely completed their inventory corrections. In the PC market, TI revenue from battery management products bottomed early in the fourth quarter and grew through the remainder of the quarter. \nIn the LCD TV market, our customers tell us that their excess inventory was significantly cleared in the fourth quarter and to expect higher demand in the current quarter, as a result, even though new orders for the quarter were down again from the third quarter.  After a very weak month of October, net orders were appreciably higher during the month of November and December. \nLet me translate all of this to our outlook. Historically, the first quarter for TI would be down about 5% compared with the fourth quarter. The middle of our current first quarter guidance range is a little better than seasonal. In addition, our backlog coverage as we enter the current first quarter was higher than recent years of history for our first quarter. To summarize the demand environment, we believe the slowdown that started in the summer of 2010 is mostly complete. \nTurning to our fourth quarter results, revenue in the fourth quarter was slightly better than the middle of our range of expectations. Revenue declined 6% sequentially and was up 17% from a year ago. Analog revenues declined 4% sequentially and grew 20% from a year ago. The sequential decline was primarily due to Power Management products given their higher exposure to the PC market. High Volume Analog and Logic products and High-Performance Analog products declined to a lesser extent. The 20% increase in Analog revenue from a year ago was mostly due to strength in High-Performance Analog products, although HVAL and Power Management both had double-digit growth. \nIn Embedded Processing, revenue declined 7% sequentially and grew 31% from a year ago. The sequential decline was due to lower catalog product revenue, with revenue from products sold into communications infrastructure and automotive applications about even. The 31% increase from a year ago was primarily due to catalog products. Communications infrastructure revenue also grew, and in fact, its growth rate exceeded 30%. Growth from products sold into automotive applications was lower, although still double digits. Total wireless revenue was about even sequentially and from a year ago. \nBaseband revenue was $435 million in the quarter, down slightly from $438 million in the prior quarter and down from $465 million a year ago. Sequential growth in the OMAP applications processor revenue was offset by lower connectivity revenue and a slightly lower Baseband revenue. From a year ago, higher connectivity and applications processor revenue was offset by the lower Baseband revenue. In our Other segment, revenue declined 14% sequentially and grew 23% from a year ago. Most of the sequential decline was the result of the seasonal decline in calculators. DLP revenues declined by about the same amount as revenue from our transitional supply agreements increased. \nAs a reminder, when we recently acquired our Aizu Japan and Chengdu China fabs, we agreed to continue to supply Spansion and SMIC with products from those factories on a transitional basis while we ramp our own productions in those facilities. The financial impact of these agreements should largely offset any carrying costs associated with those new factories and will be reflected as part of our Other segment. The 23% growth in the Other segment from a year ago was due to a combination of these transitional supply agreements, higher custom ASIC revenue and higher DLP product revenue. I should also note that the gain on our sale of a product line is included in the result of the Other segment. \nDistribution resales declined 4% compared with the prior quarter, not much different than our overall semiconductor revenue trend. We were able to help distributors replenish a few days of inventory in the quarter, helping to position down for expected growth. \nShifting briefly to our full-year 2010 results, TI revenue grew 34% in total. Each of our core businesses contributed strongly to this growth, with each area growing in excess of 40%. Analog revenue grew 42%, with strong growth in HVAL, Power Management, and HPA. Embedded Processing grew 41%, led by especially strong growth in catalog products. \nIn both Analog and Embedded Processing, we continued to benefit from the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, combined with the significant scale advantage that our field sales and applications force provides us. This means we have the ability to call on more customers and engage with them more deeply compared with our competitors. We believe the share gains we earned in 2010 were largely results of this. \nIn Wireless, the combination of applications processors and connectivity products grew slightly more than 40%. Wireless Baseband revenue was $1.7 billion in 2010, essentially unchanged from 2009. As a percent of total TI revenue, Baseband declined from 17% of TI in 2009 to 12% of revenue in 2010. We continue to be encouraged by our strong design position and momentum in OMAP applications processors. With our dual core OMAP 4 applications processor generation, we have a combination of low power and high performance that we believe is unmatched in the industry. We are now in volume production of our first OMAP 4 device. \nWe are deeply engaged in collaborating with multiple customers on tablet programs that reach across TI product lines, including OMAP 4 applications processors, single-chip wireless connectivity solutions that integrate four radio technologies: WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth and FM, and Analog Power Management technologies that optimize overall power distribution and consumption within the tablet. There are a host of other examples of OMAP's broadening design in success, including eReaders, personal navigation devices, portable data terminals and many other devices that can leverage OMAP's combination of high performance and low power. Now, Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.\nKevin March\nThanks, Ron and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial performance this quarter again illustrates the benefit of our transformation to a company focused on Analog and Embedded Processing and our associated manufacturing strategy. We've discussed for sometime that the additional manufacturing assets that we acquired over the past 15 months would have minimal negative impact on TI's financials because of the low prices that we paid for this equipment. \nIn the fourth quarter, we ramped production at three new factories. RFAB, on 300mm Analog fab located in Richardson, Texas, the Aizu Japan fab that we acquired from Spansion Japan; and the Chengdu China fab that was previously operated by SMIC. As a result, this was the first all in quarter from a financial perspective and we are now depreciating all these acquired assets. While we're now carrying the full weight of this depreciation, loadings of TI products at these factories are still low given the early stages of our production ramp. These factories provide us with tremendous headroom for growth, more than $4.5 billion in total additional revenue. As we load them with TI analog products, the profit potential is significant. \nAs you might expect, TI factory utilization was down in the fourth quarter, impacting gross margin. This was only partly the result of new capacity additions. It is also due to our lowering of production loadings in our other factories in response to the weaker demand environment. In other words, we had three variables influencing gross margin in the quarter. \nOn the negative side, we had higher costs from new factories and we had lower utilization in our existing factories as the market slowed. On the positive side, we were able to make nice strides replenishing inventory for those products whose lead times had been extended for much of the past year, largely returning those products to move to normal lead times. Given these cross currents, we're pleased with how our gross margin performed in the quarter. In total, gross profit fell 8% sequentially and our gross margin declined 150 basis points to 53% of revenue. \nTurning to our other financials, the combination of R&D and SG&A decreased $26 million in the third quarter. We had a gain on the sale of a product line of $144 million in the quarter. Operating profit for the quarter was $1.23 billion or 34.9% of revenue. Without the gain on sale, operating margin was 30.8% of revenue. Net income in the fourth quarter was $942 million or $0.78 per share. In the earnings per share calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units in which we pay dividend equivalents. \nIn the fourth quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $14 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we have reported. As you'll note in the release, earnings per share included $0.14 from the combination of the gain on the sale of a product line and a tax benefit that was primarily associated with the restatement of the federal R&D tax credit that was retroactive back at the beginning of 2010. I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. \nHowever, let me make just a few comments. Cash flow from operations was $1.23 billion. This was down $88 million in the last quarter, and up $230 million from a year ago. Capital expenditures declined to $301 million in the quarter and included additions to our assembly and test capacity, as well as our Analog wafer fab capacity. We used $600 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase 19.5 million shares of TI common stock and pay dividends of $153 million. We increased our inventory by $96 million in the quarter and inventory days to 83. With this inventory position, we have returned lead times to normal levels. Orders in the quarter declined to $3.13 billion. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 0.89 the quarter. Orders bottomed in the month of October, with November and December orders appreciably above that level. \nTurning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.27 billion to $3.55 billion in the first quarter or down 7% to up 1% sequentially. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.62. Our estimate for 2011 R&D is $1.7 billion. 2011 capital expenditures and depreciation are expected to be about $900 million each. Our estimate for our 2011 effective tax rate is 30%. Please note that our estimates for 2011 depreciation is approximately the same as we had in 2010. As I described in October, the additional depreciation associated with our acquired manufacturing assets will be mostly offset by the roll off of depreciation from capital expenditures five years ago. Needless to say, even though our fixed cost in the form of depreciation will be essentially unchanged, our ability to grow and to respond to customer demand will be much higher. \nBefore I wrap up, I'm going to make some brief comments about 2010 overall. It was a good year for TI and our shareholders, with strong 34% revenue growth, gross margins have expanded 570 basis points to 53.6% of revenue and operating margins that moved up 1,320 basis points to 32.3% of revenues. We didn't just ride the rising tide of a growing semiconductor market. We believe we also gained significant market share overall, as well as in each of our core businesses. We've described to you for sometime the potential that we believe exists in a transformed TI and I believe 2010 provided a glimpse into that potential. \nOur challenge going forward is to demonstrate that 2010 wasn't a one-off year. We must prove that we can continue to grow our Analog and Embedded Processing revenues significantly faster than those markets. We need to expand our wireless connectivity and applications to process server positions in the smartphone market, as well as in tablets. And we needed to continue to manage our Baseband business for maximum cash flow while it continues to become a smaller part of our company. \nIf we do these things right, our shareholders have also continued to benefit. For example, in 2010 alone, our Return On Invested Capital was 30.7% and we generated $3.82 billion of cash from operations. This allowed us to repurchase $2.5 billion of our stock and pay dividends of almost $600 million. Combined, these cash returns to our shareholders amounted to about 10% of our initial market capitalization when we entered the year.\nKey to all this is that our Analog and Embedded Processing products are highly differentiated and not dependent upon the latest manufacturing technologies. Therefore, our capital requirements are relatively low. High differentiation and low capital requirements allow us to be more profitable and we don't have to channel all of our profits back into the manufacturing operations. As a result, we expect to continue to be able to provide significant returns to our shareholders in the years ahead. With that, let me turn it back to Ron.\nRon Slaymaker\nThanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions]\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nTore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nYou talked a little bit about the bookings trends in November and December. Could you just talk a little bit about what you've seen so far this quarter?\nRon Slaymaker\nI won't break it down week by week, Tore but I will say that everything that we've seen both on the order front, as well as shipments or revenue has been strong thus far in the quarter. So we've seen nothing thus far that would discourage us at all from the outlook that we've provided.\nKevin March\nLet me just add to that, if I can. Our backlog coming into the quarter was actually higher than we've seen from first quarter over the last few years, which gives further confidence to the outlook that we're providing.\nTore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nAnd I realize you were to able to build a little bit of inventory in Q4. What's your inventory plan for the March quarter?\nKevin March\nSpecifically on the inventory plans per se, but we do expect to continue to build inventory on those parts that have high demand that we want to keep short lead times on. And clearly, the shape of the 2Q demand will dictate just how much inventory we try to position if we go through the quarter.\nRon Slaymaker\nBut keep in mind, Tore the other factor, even though we have a plan to build inventory, depending upon where we land in that revenue range, that could impact our inventory expectations or actuals as well.\nOperator\nWe'll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.\nUche Orji - UBS Investment Bank\nLet me just start by off by asking in terms of where you've seen bookings improvement. So you called out the books, you also talked about LCD TV. I just want to understand whether you've also seen that from distributors as well? So if you are able to kind of walk through by end market, however you can just give us a sense of where bookings are coming from?\nRon Slaymaker\nI guess I would say it is reasonably broad-based now. Again, the overall trend was down. But we specifically called out what we were seeing in PCs and some of the HDTV space because those were areas that in prior calls, we had noted that there was inventory correction underway in those areas were particularly weak. To hit on distribution, I think I said in the prepared remarks that our distribution resales were down about 4% sequentially. I think I noted that we were able to help distributors build a few days of inventory. But I would say their inventory levels are at very comfortable levels from an absolute standpoint. They're just over six weeks of inventory currently. And if you look at historical levels, we've seen them generally in the eight to nine weeks. Now, you probably need to adjust that for about 30% of our distribution revenue that we now support with consignment. But even with that adjustment, certainly inventories are at very, I'd call, normal or typical levels compared to history and at a comfortable level based on what the distributors are expecting in terms of their future resale demand.\nUche Orji - UBS Investment Bank\nCan I just ask you about OMAP 4? You've talked about a prospect for OMAP 4 but one wouldn't help but notice that your OMAP 3 was designed out from one of your large customers. I just want to kind of get a sense of how we should be confident about the prospects of OMAP 4, especially as you see more and more competition there, get more tablets based. Are there any comments you can make there? And also, just types to clarify your stance on the tablet market with OMAP 4.\nRon Slaymaker\nDid you mention a specific competitor in the tablets space?\nUche Orji - UBS Investment Bank\nThat's right. We've seen [indiscernible] get very aggressive. We've heard comments about how much share of gains within the tablet market. And that's been probably the one product; one of shipping now is tablets that we know. So I just want to see now what makes you comfortable about OMAP 4 prospects in the light of all the competitions resting in the system.\nRon Slaymaker\nWhat makes us comfortable are the designs programs we have underway and design programs that are specifically slated to go into production. Let me just say these are not long-term development programs. These are programs that are going to result in relatively near-term revenue. The competitor you referred to, NVIDIA, to their credit, was the first out with a dual core applications processor. I believe they had a couple of months, maybe a quarter lead on our OMAP 4 product. OMAP 4 began sampling fourth quarter a year ago. So we've had that product in customers' hands for over a year at this point. We're well along in development program. And again, them being first for customers that are trying to get out with tablet programs, right away, especially some that are based upon the Android operating system, they're the player, they were the first player out so there is a natural alignment there. But I guess what I would say is we fully are comfortable that we will be there as these programs hit stride and ramp into real volume. I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are in volume production now with OMAP 4. And we're not just in production to put those products in inventories. In fact, we're shipping to a customer that plans to ramp their tablet production based on OMAP 4. So again, we've acknowledged for a long time the tablet market, as is the smartphone market will be a competitive market. But I think you're going to find that translates to great opportunity for TI across a variety of product areas.\nOperator\nWe'll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nFirst question, this quarter is a little bit unusual from the standpoint of your competitors are saying different things about their own lead times. Some say they're all the way back down to normal, consistent with what you're saying. Others are suggesting their own lead times are still elevated. Do you have any sense that you can give us for sort of industry average with the combination of some competitors still being extended and others still being all the way back down?\nRon Slaymaker\nJim, I agree completely with what you're describing, that I actually think different competitors are at different points. I know even last week, I was listening to a call where a competitor, a very credible competitor was talking about their lead times have progressed but they still remain extended, we'll take more time. I think the best thing I can say about our own situation is I believe we got on top of the situation earlier in terms of capacity investments and we brought that capacity online. And that's what translated to lead time reduction for us. I think you can always have demand fix your lead times. If it turns down enough, I think if anything for us, this respite in demand we've had over the last couple of quarters really just allowed us to get the capacity investments that we have been making, get it online, get some inventory in place and get our lead times back to normal. I think the other thing that's going to be important is depending upon what happens with growth in our industry, in 2011. I think we feel completely comfortable with the headroom that we have on our capacity now that will allow us to grow quite aggressively, if that's what the market wants to do. And at the same time, maintain our lead times where we and our customers want them to be. I think you'll find if we get into some heady growth in 2011, a lot of our competitors that have not made capacity investments and maybe lead times have adjusted maybe more recently because of slower demand environment over the last quarter, I suspect you'll find them in a different situation with their lead time trends in that kind of environment.\nJames Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nIf I could ask specifically about how you feel that your position within power management in the tablet space? I know another one of your competitors have referenced the fact that they lost the socket, the power management socket, in the tablet and I know everybody's trying to figure out who potentially gained that socket and I wondered how well positioned you think you are in that space?\nRon Slaymaker\nThere's a broad question and there's an implied question. Let me answer the broad question, which is I think we are very well positioned in the tablet with our power management. And you know well, we're well-positioned overall in the marketplace with power management but certainly, tablets are a targeted area for us across a number of product lines just because that's a new emerging space with a lot of opportunities. In fact, maybe I can even diverge for a second and talk about that opportunity overall. I'll stay away from the implied question, which was... were we the player that picked up their lost socket? But I will say we're well-positioned and we think there's a lot of opportunity. Let me maybe just kind of walk through a little bit our view of the tablet opportunity for TI. I know there's a lot of dialogue amongst analysts and investors on how big is that opportunity and how does it compare to a PC. For us, we believe there's over $30 of content opportunity in a tablet. And that goes across Analog, OMAP and wireless connectivity. And kind of the break out of that is the Analog content alone is over $10. The OMAP content, the apps processor opportunity is in the $15 range and then there's probably an additional $3 to $5 of content opportunity for connectivity. By no means do we have all of that in each system. In some cases, we are playing on Analog and maybe not on OMAP. But certainly, that's the opportunity. If I compare that opportunity to a PC for TI, I'd say the biggest difference is that in a PC, the processor, as well as most of the connectivity value really is dominated by a single player. And that's not an opportunity for TI. Of course, unlike a tablet, a PC includes a hard disk drive where we would have probably $1 to $2 of content per system on average. But the net difference between that PC opportunity and a tablet really represents a very significant opportunity for TI. The breadth of our portfolio across Analog, OMAP and connectivity, I'll just say gives us a tremendous opportunity to carve out what could be a very, very significant piece of this important emerging market and we plan to make the most of it.\nOperator\nWe'll go next to Shawn Webster with Macquarie.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie Research\nOn the gross margins, can you give us a flavor of the moving parts to go into Q1 and Q2 as it relates to your business and more particularly your utilization rates? Do you expect them to decline again in Q1?\nKevin March\nShawn, in the first quarter, I already mentioned that we felt the full effect of bringing three new factories online. So that clearly had an impact on us. The utilization in the fourth quarter was actually down quite a few points. And that wasn't all just attributable to the new factories. We consciously slowed down production in our remaining factories, with the exception of those products where we had extended lead times. We continue to build inventory on those products alone in order to get lead times back to normal. So, while we bring it on the new factories and define overall utilization, the weight in our margins in the fourth quarter. Going in the first quarter, we expect utilization maybe up another point or two, not significantly, but up a little bit and really will be a function of both how demand shapes up in the first quarter and more importantly, how our outlook begins to shape up for second quarter and beyond so we can have inventory ready on time to maintain the achievement we've had on bringing lead times in.\nRon Slaymaker\nJust to ask and clarify Kevin, so the new factories that were being already accounted for in the fourth quarter for the most part, all the assets that we had previously acquired from Qimonda, Spansion and the China fab that was all in. There's not another chunk to come along in the first quarter, correct?\nKevin March\nThere's not another chunk to come along, it is all in. In fact one of the best ways you could see that is look on our cash flow statement and look at the depreciation line. You will see a step up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. If you just multiply that times four, it's consistent with our $900 million depreciation we have for 2011.\nRon Slaymaker\nSo fourth quarter was already at the 2011 depreciation run rate.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie Research\nSo on lead times, are there any other areas where your product lead times are still the tightest or are actually going out in Q1? And you mentioned your end markets that were good. Are there any specific end markets that are still soft or you expect the weakest sequential growth in Q1?\nKevin March\nOn lead times, the overwhelming majority of products are back to a normal lead time. There are still some exceptions but there always is in a normal industry cycle anyway. There are some parts where we'd prefer to have shorter lead times and some customers would prefer that also, but that now the minority of parts as opposed to the majority. Most of that is just fine. We expect now that we've gotten lead times largely caught up, we'll continue to use a relatively seasonal down period in the first quarter to make sure that we've got much more attractive lead times in the event that 2011 becomes a stronger year as Ron was talking about earlier so we can maintain what we've got in there.\nOperator\nWe will go next to Chris Danely with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co\nSo you mentioned that the inventory correction looks to be over in certain parts but maybe not over in other parts. Can you just talk about the various end markets and what stages you see them being at vis-a-vis, any sort of inventory issue? And I guess maybe throw in your expectations for the end markets this quarter and the rest of the year?\nRon Slaymaker\nChris, let me take a stab at it and Kevin may have a few comments to make. We're not going to be able to walk through market by market. I think what we have tried to do is identify in the few areas that we specifically have previously noted the inventory correction was the most significant. We've tried to provide some guidance or perspective that we think that inventory correction is largely complete. If you go more broadly, there are some customers that probably are totally clean. There are other customers that would not be in similar situation or still have more to go in terms of cleaning up inventory. And now, it will vary customer by customers, maybe somewhat market by market but probably more customer by customer. I don't know that we're really going to do us a lot of benefit to walk through each of those other than what you may gain from listening and talking to those customers directly as they report their own result.\nKevin March\nI think that's right. Just to reemphasize on what Ron opened with though, the PC space we saw at least for our battery management products bottomed in the beginning of the fourth quarter and grew steadily through the balance of the quarter. TV space seemed to have bottomed out in the quarter. And indications from our customers that their inventories are largely cleared and we can expect resumptions of orders in the first quarter. We talked about communications infrastructure continuing to be solid in the quarter, automotive being recently solid. Smartphones are actually quite strong and with the adoption rates, consumer level around the world, one would expect that, that would probably be -- continue to be quite strong going into 2011. And then the industrial space, we had talked about 90 days ago that industrial had been enjoying quite a few quarters of very strong growth led by inventory replenishment, as well as just in demand growth and then we expected that, that growth rate will probably slow down in the fourth quarter and in fact, it did. It slowed down to just in demand kind of growth and we expect that to be the norm going forward.\nChristopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co\nSo in 2010, your Analog, Embedded and other businesses all grew roughly the same within a few points of each other. Can you give us your sense of relative to your overall TI revenue growth, where you would expect those three product regions to grow?\nKevin March\nChris, I'll just remind you that our objective that we talked about is growing those core areas in their respective markets. And in fact, we did that this past year. They've done enough in a couple of years if you take a look at them. The total company grew at 34% and the core areas grew at 40% plus, a little over 40% for the non-baseband wireless, about 42% for Embedded processing and 43% for Analog. So, clearly very strong growth rates and a lot of momentum given the scale of sales force and the scale of the portfolio, plus more recently the scale of our manufacturing capabilities. Our ability to outgrow our competitors certainly seems to be more highly probable today than you might have thought a couple of years ago, especially in light of the observation that Ron made earlier. And that is, we did take action in late 2009 and especially 2010 to increase our manufacturing capacity, which allowed us to begin bringing our lead times in many cases before quite a few of our competitors could. Many of our competitors would not necessarily take similar actions and should we have a resumption of growth as we go into second quarter and beyond, it could be difficult for some of them to respond to customer demand, which increases the probability again that we will outgrow our marketplace in 2011.\nKevin March\nAnd Chris, as I know you're well aware but just as a reminder for broader audience, there is Baseband revenue that will decline over the next couple of years. And that's 12% of our revenue both fourth quarter, as well as for the year. I found it interesting that even though it didn't contribute to company growth at an absolute level it held those dollars, Baseband dollars, held relatively stable from '09 to 2010.  Yet, as a percentage of revenue, it continues to decline, it continues to I would say it as be less important to us and less impactful to us. So that will continue to wind down and certainly, not provide the growth contribution that the core areas will. And just to give you a sort of a refresh on the numbers, the baseband revenue is over 90%, 3G, this point, if you compare that to a year ago. It was 66% 3G. So what you've seen is both as the non-3G market has not shown a lot of growth and to some degree as our customers brought on alternative suppliers in the non-3G technologies, that is now a minimal part of our revenue base. Sometime this year, they'll have a supplier for 3G on Baseband. And you can expect at that time then, incursion or degradation in that 3G revenue for TI. But just stay in tune what their alternative suppliers and what that customer says as to the timing of when that will be. It's not right now, is what I would say.\nOperator\nWe'll go next to Glen Yeung with Citi.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc\nRon or Kevin, maybe just a clarification from an earlier question but in a circumstance where we're kind of an average growth year call it a 5% to 10% for the industry, do you feel that the capacity you've added is going to be a competitive advantage? Or another way of asking the same question is do you think of the industry absent your capacity is going to be relatively tight and really by adding capacity the way you have, you can therefore take market share? And that's sort of in an average growth curve?\nKevin March\nGlen, if we just kind of take a look again at the capacity of the industry, you're well aware that with the onset of the downturn after the third quarter of '08, something in the order of 17% of available capacity was taken off-line and pretty much permanently off-line. Since then, there's been some capacity added but the last reports I saw suggested that total industry capacity, and I'm not including memory in that statement is somewhere around 90% of where it was in the third quarter of '08. I would just say that we're still under capacitized given demand if you will because the total market is now back above where it was in third quarter '08. So even if you just have an average kind of growth rate like you're describing, it would certainly seem that the market is going to be very stressed on capacity going into 2011 and competitors who have not thought ahead to put capacity in place and they find that rather difficult to deal with. What we find particularly attractive again is that the capacity that we have brought online has been at price points, cost points that we simply have not seen in the past. So if it turns out to be a slow growth year, it's not going to have much impact financially on a negative standpoint. If it turns out to be or strong growth year, we should be able to convert that into very profitable revenue at a rate beyond what our competitors can manage.\nRon Slaymaker\nAnd Glen, I'll just also note rhetorically, when was the last time our industry has growth at an average growth rate? Usually, it's very aggressive or in decline, you know that as well as any of us.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc\nYou talk about OMAP 4, which is a dual core solution today. Can you talk about your plans if you have any for a quad core solution and as part of that, can you address whether or not you think that's even a relevant architecture to have in today's market?\nRon Slaymaker\nI don't know. I think if you look at the one, call it the next-generation core, I don't think we specifically announced that we're using it for OMAP. But then again maybe we did. We've licensed in fact, I think we were the initial licensee from ARM for their Eagle Core. So I don't know that necessarily we go a key player in additional parallel courses as maybe moved to higher performance directions such as Eagle. But I guess we always have that flexibility.\nOperator\nWe'll go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.\nJonathan Smigie - Raymond James & Associates\nI'm not sure if you discussed it but can you talk about if your mix of Analog between high-volume, power and high-performance remain roughly the same, percentage wise, as you sort of discussed in the past?\nRon Slaymaker\nSteve, it actually has. When we looked at how 2010 landed overall versus 2009, you might recall in 2009, we've described that breakout, 40% HVAL and then 30% each High Performance Analog and Power. And the good news is and frankly, what we had tried to set as expectations was we thought we were at a point where we would have HVAL contributing at about the same pace as those others. So that makes an impact, that happens and the mix did not change 2010 compared to 2009. So again, further reinforcement of a lot of the work that we have done to have HVAL become a major contributor to our growth in fact has followed through to reality.\nJonathan Smigie - Raymond James & Associates\nWith regard to HVAL, as you mentioned, you put a lot of work into that. I know you have a number of wins. You've taken some technology transferred to other areas. Does that suggest as we go through 2011, HVAL will now perhaps outgrow the other categories?\nRon Slaymaker\nI don't know that we would expect it to outgrow the other categories. I think our expectations, and this is not a 2011 statement, it's a longer-term statement, our expectation is that the opportunity and our growth should be pretty well balanced across power, HPA and HVAL. So that's probably as specific as I'd like to be at this point.\nOperator\nWe'll go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG\nKind of a question that followed on from Chris' question earlier, rather than by end market, if you talked about your better than seasonal guide by the four product segments you have, are there any big outliers in what's being better than seasonal, worse than seasonal or right at seasonal?\nKevin March\nRoss, I don't think there's anything really specific to point at. Part of it is that we had a slightly below seasonal fourth quarter and so that's down looks the other way when you go into first quarter. But again beyond that what we had dragging on us was that PC and consumer space and with the TV space in the fourth quarter. As we indicated, we now are seeing PC begin to pick back up and indications from our TV customers is that the TV, people that we supply, is that we would expect to see a resumption of orders in the first quarter. Beyond that, there's not any one place that I would additional color to.\nRon Slaymaker\nAnd Ross, as you understand probably, we try not to take our forecast or outlook and break it down by individual segments or product lines. But we probably will -- probably serve us well to stay with that approach.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG\nThe TV and PC together, what that represents as a percentage of sales? Then the real follow up, on OpEx, it dropped nicely in the fourth quarter. I know you give full-year guidance to R&D, but what are the puts and takes for OpEx in the first quarter specifically?\nKevin March\nRoss, the OpEx was down in the fourth quarter and that's fairly typical where we see people taking more vacation time and so on. So you'll tend to see OpEx decline, which it did nicely. We would expect in the first quarter, OpEx to increase. A good is to look back at last year. Last year's fourth quarter, our OpEx was up around $30 million quarter-over-quarter and that was a direct effect of the increase that we typically put into place in the first quarter, as well as just far fewer vacation days in the quarter. So again, we'd expect to see a similar up on a quarter-to-quarter basis to what we saw a year ago. In addition to that, you might note that I did give R&D guidance as being up a little bit from what we spent this past year and that will start immediately in the first quarter. So I would expect it to be up OpEx in the first quarter at a faster growth rate than what we saw in the year-ago quarter, again on the function of paying benefit increases, fewer vacation days and stepped up spending on R&D.\nRon Slaymaker\nFor your question it's a mix of revenue, that is TV and PCs, you're going to get a bonus answer and I'm going to breakout our revenue overall by market. This is for 2010 as a whole. Communications was 42% of revenue, and that's down a few points from 2009. And I'll also note the biggest piece inside of communications is communications infrastructure. Computer was 22% of 2010 revenue, down a point from '09. Let me break that 22% out because it goes across several different areas. PCs actually is about 9%. That's what we sell directly into PC manufacturers. Beyond that, we also have sell into storage manufacturers both in terms of hard disk drives, as well as optical. That's about 6% of revenue. Servers is 1%. Monitors are 4%. And really think of that as DLP front projector revenue. And then printers are 2%. And then continuing at the TI level, industrial is 14% of revenue or was 14% last year. And that's up a few points from 2009. Consumer was 11% and that's unchanged from '09. And inside of that, Ross is the TV number, but I don't have a specific breakout for television. Automotive last year was 8%, up a couple of points from '09. And then education, which is really our calculator product, was 3% in 2010, down one point from 2009.\nOperator\nWe'll go next to Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.\nTimothy Luke - Barclays Capital\nMaybe from the fourth quarter and as you look at the first calendar quarter guidance, could you give us, Kevin, any feel for the contribution from the revenues associated with the factory service deals that you have in China or in Japan? And separately, rather in the vein of Ross' question on the OpEx side, in seeing a somewhat lower gross margin in the calendar fourth quarter, could you give us some feel for what some of the puts and takes might be in what appears to be a slightly lower gross margin for the first quarter?\nKevin March\nTim, on the revenue from the Transition Services Agreement, we've focused in the past and still hold forecast that we expect those revenues to be less than 1% of our 2011 overall revenues. And we won't break it down any more than that or by quarters anymore than that. I would just put a little bit more color on that, remind you that with the Chengdu fab, as we disclosed, that transition service agreement will run for three or four quarters before it winds down. And with the Spansion fab, that transition services agreement will run for up to two years and winding down during the course of that period. But overall, revenue is expected to be less than 1% of our 2011 revenue.\nTimothy Luke - Barclays Capital\nIs the contribution Kevin fairly similar in the fourth quarter and the first quarter? Or is that helping, to some extent, with the slightly better than seasonal guidance?\nKevin March\nIt will be fairly similar quarter-over-quarter. Fourth quarter versus the first all in quarter for all three of those factories, specifically those who are doing the transition services agreement on. So, first quarter should be offset. And your second question Tim on OpEx?\nTimothy Luke - Barclays Capital\nMore on gross margins puts and takes as we begin the year.\nKevin March\nYou indicated you felt maybe gross margin might be a little different in the first quarter. I would remind you that we do expect utilization to be up a little bit in the first quarter. I'm not quite sure how you're putting that into your model, but do make sure that you've got the OpEx properly accounted for on 4Q going into 1Q. That is it was up $30 million a year ago. It should be up more than that this quarter because we're stepping up our R&D. Also, don't forget that should just stock dividend equivalent adjustment that we have to make on our earnings per share. We need to make a similar adjustment when you do your model so you get back to what you think is the target GPM percent of course.\nOperator\nWe'll go next to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.\nStacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research\nThe orders down 9% this quarter, revenue guidance down about 3%. Is that mismatch strictly because of the order linearity in the quarter? And can you give me some feeling I guess if October or is it a little bit more normal might those two numbers, orders and revenue guidance been more closely matched?\nKevin March\nWhat we really see in there, Stacy, is as lead times came in, as they started coming in the third quarter, we already began to see our book to bill fall below one, which is really quite normal. So, customers who may have been putting six months backlog on us, as we began to move the lead time in, didn't have to give us backlog orders as far out in time. Frankly, they could go for a few weeks or even a couple of months without putting new orders on and still have the backlog coverage they want. So we saw that sort of phenomena going on in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And it's quite normal and was quite expected. The other thing that we did see, that gives again reassurance as to the outlook that we provided for the first quarter is that we had a backlog coverage going into first quarter that frankly was higher than we've seen for a number of years. That's consistent I think with what we've been talking about, the markets, the major markets of PC and TVs we talked about, pretty much cleared their inventory in the fourth quarter and were beginning to see kind of a normal order pattern beginning to show up as we came into late fourth quarter and currently as we move further into the first quarter as well.\nRon Slaymaker\nI would add maybe two other things, Stacy. Again, it's not new but just reiterating what we said. Our views of the corrections and adjustments to customer inventories and where they are in that progress is part of the reason. Another reason is, maybe the last reason would be that just what we've seen quarter to date in terms of strength, both in terms of orders and revenues play into that confidence as well.\nStacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research\nRegarding the R&D guidance, can you give us some feeling for where you're investing the incremental spend in terms of the specific types of projects or areas?\nKevin March\nIt's going to be across the core area, Stacy, of Analog, Embedded Processing and the non-baseband portion of wireless. But I would just say that given the size, Analog will get most of those dollars. And then you'll get a distribution of that into the Embedded Processing next and the remainder, the growth will go into the non-baseband portion of wireless. But it's all in the core product areas. It is not in other areas.\nOperator\nWe'll take our final question from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG\nJust a follow-up to an earlier question, on the $435 million, which is baseband, how do we think we should model that? It sounds like no incremental suppliers to your big customers until mid-year. And so, flattish first half and then a decline. How should we think about that?\nRon Slaymaker\nJohn, you've heard us say before that if you straight line from where we are today down to zero in the first quarter '13, the only thing we can tell you is that'll be wrong. You'll have some quarters above; you'll have some quarters below. I know qualitatively, I've tried to describe that most of that revenue is 3G and until they have a 3G player ready to start supplying that revenues, well, I won't say it's stable, but it will move with our customers' own business levels. But we've kind of given up forecasting when they're going to have a specific alternative supplier on board. I'm going to shift that risk to you as the analysts now. But you at least know that our mix of 3G to be able to base that on.\nJohn Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG\nIf you look over the last decade, you guys have always done a good job growing R&D slower than you grow revenue, and I know you're not going to him to easily back into a revenue guidance for the year but when you look at the R&D guidance up over 8% for the year, is there something unusual about this year that is a structurally high investment year? Or when we think about the core business x Baseband, is that leverage that you guys have been able to show in the past still applicable?\nKevin March\nI don't know what your revenue assumption is John but it sounds pessimistic. You said R&D up...\nJohn Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG\nIs there anything that you see in the R&D for this year specifically which would drive R&D growth faster than revenue growth?\nKevin March\nNo.\nRon Slaymaker\nOverall, thank you. As we wrap up, thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website, and good evening.\nOperator\nAnd again, that does conclude today's call. We do appreciate everyone's participation.\n\n",

Welcome to the Union Pacific First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Koraleski, you may begin.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nGood morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today here in Omaha are Rob Knight, our CFO; Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, Executive Vice President of Operations.\nThis morning, we're pleased to announce that Union Pacific achieved record first quarter financial results, leveraging the strengths of our diverse franchise despite significantly weaker coal and grain markets. Earnings of $2.03 per share increased 13% compared to 2012. We efficiently managed our operations in the face of dynamic volume shifts across our network as evidenced by our record first quarter operating ratio and customer satisfaction results. Putting it all together, it translates into greater financial returns for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Eric.\nEric L. Butler\nThanks, Jack, and good morning. Let's start off with a look at customer satisfaction, which came in at 94 for the quarter, tying an all-time quarterly record. It is up 1 point from the first quarter last year, setting a new first quarter record, and along the way, March tied our best ever month at 95. We appreciate customer recognition of the strength of our value proposition and continue to work to make it even stronger.\nAs expected, some key markets were a challenge in the first quarter, and as a result, overall volume was down 2%. While Chemicals, Intermodal and Automotive grew and Industrial Products was flat, it wasn't enough to offset the challenging market conditions that drove steep declines in Coal and Ag products, whilst the coal demand have continued to have the largest impact on overall growth. Setting the decline in the coal loadings aside, the other 5 groups grew 2.5% despite the drought related to shortfall in Ag. Note that the volume comparisons were subject to last year's leap year which included an extra day of carloadings.\nCore price improved 4%, which combined with the modest benefit from positive mix and increased fuel surcharge revenue produced nearly a 6% improvement in average revenue per car. With the price-driven average revenue per car gains outpacing the volumes decline, freight revenue grew to 3% to $5 billion.\nLet's take a closer look at each of these groups, starting with the 2 that saw declines. Coal volumes were down 19%, as high coal stockpiles created by last year's low natural gas prices continued to impact demand. Core pricing gains and positive mix led to a 16% improvement in average revenue per car, holding the revenue decline to 6%. High stockpiles and inventory reduction initiatives by specific utility drove the decline in the Southern Powder River Basin shipments, with tonnage down 19%. Although coal stockpiles started to decline from last year's peak, they remain above normal levels.\nAlso contributing to the decline was a previously mentioned loss of a legacy customer contract at the beginning of the year, which more than offset business gains. Colorado/Utah coal shipments also declined, soft domestic demand, mine production problems and the weak international market for Western U.S. coal limited shipments, with tonnage down 15%.\nBefore we move on to Ag, please note that this slide shows the ease in comp we had year-over-year in the second quarter. Ag Products revenue declined 9%, with volume down 9% and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Last summer's drought continued to impact grain carloadings, with first quarter down 19% from last year.\nDomestic feed grain shipments declined as tight U.S. corn supplies, especially in UP served territories led to reductions in livestock feedings and increased reliance on local feed crop. Export feed grain shipments also declined with improved world production and lower U.S. supplies. Grain product shipments were down 4%, as reduced demand for gasoline has increased use of lending credits from previous years to meet the mandate to over 10% decline in ethanol shipment. A reduced supply and greater emphasis on meeting local demand impacted DDG volumes, which fell 26%. Food and refrigerated shipments also declined 3%, driven by lower sugar imports from Mexico and new restrictions in Russia and China that imported limit -- that limited import of U.S. meat and poultry.\nAutomotive volume grew 2%, which combined with an 11% increase in average revenue per car drove a 13% increase in revenue. The growth rate of the Automotive industry continued to outpace that of the overall economy during the first quarter. Drivers that helped the momentum in the Automotive market last year continued into the first quarter, largely pent-up demand and an improving overall economy. New fuel-efficient models equipped with more features and technology appeared to be compelling consumers to replace vehicles.\nIn addition, a rebound in the housing and construction market have increased demand for light trucks. While sales continued to grow, our finished vehicles shipments lag as OEMs had unscheduled downtime to deal with product refreshes and dealers sold off existing inventories to support sales. Parts volumes increased 5%, while pricing gains and the previously announced Pacer network logistics management arrangement increased average revenue per car.\nChemicals revenue increased 14%, reflecting a 12% increase in volume and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Crude oil volume increased 11% from the previous quarter, more than doubled when compared to the first quarter of 2012. Growth was driven by increased shipments from Bakken, Western Oklahoma and West Texas shale plays UP served terminals, primarily in St. James, Louisiana and the Texas Gulf Coast.\nPlastics volume was up 3%, driven by the increased domestic demand and new business. Growth in the export market was the primary driver of the 4% growth in soda ash. Strong demand from Eastern Origins, Louisiana, as well as new business at the Gulf Coast led to growth in LP Gas, with shipments up 13%.\nIndustrial Products revenue increased 6% even as volume remains flat, driven by a 7% improvement in average revenue per car. Nonmetallic materials volume was up 11%, as continued growth in shale-related drilling increased fracs and shipments. Growth in housing starts and residential improvements increased the demand for lumber, with shipments up 18%. Hazardous waste shipments declined 63%, as costs on government spending resulted in production curtailments during the first 2 months of the year, impacting uranium tailing shipments. The slow start for pipeline projects, lower steel production and softer demand for export scrap was reflected in the 10% decline in steel and scrap. Continued mining production issues continued to hamper our expert iron ore shipments, leading to a 5% decline in metallic minerals.\nIntermodal revenue grew 9%, as a 4% improvement in average revenue per car -- per unit, combined with the 4% increase in volume. Although the pace of recovery is slow, continued strengthening of the economy drove International Intermodal up 8%. While we continued to secure highway conversions with multi-carrier and premium LTL customers, overall domestic Intermodal shipments were flat, as these gains were offset by declines in select markets.\nA closer look at the remainder of 2013. Most economic projections continued to forecast slow economic growth. Although we face continued challenges in some markets, our diverse franchise still provides opportunity to grow in others. Despite softness in coal demand and the previously announced loss of a customer contract at the beginning of the year, we expect coal volumes in the second quarter to see slight gains against an ease in comp last year. This assume the continuation of recent trends in natural gas prices and further coal stockpile reductions.\nFor the full year, we still expect coal volumes to be down slightly. We'll continue to feel the impact of the drought on last year's grain crop through the first half of this year, with second quarter Ag product volume expected to be down in the low double digits. Expectation for a more normal crop harvest in 2013 should provide opportunity later in the year.\nFirst quarter Auto sales were at a seasonably adjusted annual rate of $15.2 million, the highest quarterly level in 5 years. The steady pace is expected to continue throughout the year, which combined with declining dealer inventories, should be good news for our Automotive business.\nCrude oil should continue to drive Chemicals growth, but the pace will ease against the ramp up of volumes realized throughout 2012. Most other chemical markets are expected to remain solid.\nIndustrial Products should also continue to benefit from shale-related growth, with increased drilling activity and a ramp up in pipeline projects after a slow start to the year. The housing recovery continues to gain momentum, which is expected to drive demand for lumber. Iron ore moves are expected to decline due to softer export demand and mining production issues.\nSuccessful conversion of highway business is expected to drive Domestic Intermodal growth, while modest economic growth and the strengthening housing markets should ease International Intermodal ahead of last year.\nFor the full year, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will again support business development opportunities across our broad portfolio of business. Assuming the economy cooperates, we will see a more normal summer weather patterns, we expect a slight volume increase combined with price gains to drive profitable revenue growth.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Lance.\nLance M. Fritz\nThank you, Eric. And good morning. Let's start with our safety results. Our first quarter reportable personal injury rate increased from first quarter 2012. The reportable incident rate was abnormally high in February but moderated substantially in March, and continued to show improvement year-over-year at the start of this quarter. Severe injuries declined sharply in the first quarter, reflecting our work to reduce the risk of critical incidents and the growth and maturation of our Total Safety Culture.\nRail equipment incidents or derailments improved to an all-time quarterly record. This improvement is largely the result of reduction in track cost derailments, which is a direct reflection of the investments we've made to harden our infrastructure. We also reaped the benefits from technological advancements and equipment defect detection.\nMoving to public safety. Our grade crossing incident rate increased about 14% from the first quarter 2012. Our grade crossing incident exposure is increasing due to growing rail and highway traffic in the South, which has a higher grade crossing density than our overall network. Driver behavior was a meaningful contributor, with an increase from vehicle striking our trains or not properly stopping at crossings. As I've said in January, we continued to focus on identifying and improving or closing high-risk crossings, and reinforcing public awareness and safe driving practices.\nNow let's take a quick look at the traffic pattern shifts we continued to experience on the network.\nvolumes on the southern region of our network continued to grow. In the South, we are near all-time peak carload volume last seen in 2006 and we are moving it more efficiently, with train speed up about 14% compared to 2006. While service was good by historical standards in the South, we experienced modest operational challenges during the first quarter, which were reflected in our monthly velocity and terminal dwell numbers. We responded aggressively by leveraging our fluid routes and terminals and realigning critical resources. As a result, we completed an aggressive first quarter capital renewal program in the South, and I am pleased to report fluidity has improved substantially over the last few weeks.\nWe are also making continued capacity investments to support volume growth across our diverse portfolio of businesses in the South. We expect 2013 capacity spending to top 2012, which includes critical double track additions, siding extensions and terminal capacity. These projects, along with continued process efficiencies, should support further improvement in network fluidity and service performance.\nThe first quarter service results were solid, and our network is well-positioned to handle future volume growth. Velocity was basically flat compared to the first quarter of 2012, with the modest slippage I mentioned in the South, offset by a strong results in other parts of the network.\nWe continued to provide outstanding local service to our customers with the first quarter best 95% industry Spot & Pull, which measures the on-time delivery of pulling of a car to or from a customer. Our Service Delivery Index, the measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, declined modestly compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decline reflects tighter service commitments to our customers, with service challenges discussed earlier and the mix shift from coal to manifest.\nNetwork fundamentals remained solid. We are increasing capacity in the southern region and we have available capacity in many other parts of the network, as well as roughly 450 employees per load and about 800 locomotives in storage.\nMoving on to network productivity. Slow order miles declined 25% to a best-ever quarter -- first quarter level. Our network is in excellent shape, reflecting the investments in replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced service failures. And we continued to leverage existing resources as our Intermodal and Manifest business volumes grow. During the first quarter, we turned the 4% growth in Intermodal volume into an average train size increase of 2%. Intermodal, Manifest, Coal and Grain Train Size lengths offset new first quarter records. Continued deployment of DPU locomotives, our capital investment strategy and process improvements should continue to drive efficiency gains going forward.\nCar utilization was 1% unfavorable versus the first quarter of 2012 due to mix. Mix being equal, our car utilization rate would have been unchanged from last year's first quarter. The UP Way is playing a vital role in these results. Employee engagement is critical to the success of our average strategy, and as the team's doing the work to take ownership of improving the process and outcomes.\nWe remain optimistic on our full year operating outlook for 2013, and our ability to achieve continued network improvements on various fronts. Our first quarter results were solid, and there is room for improvement. I am encouraged by what I am seeing at the start of the second quarter, and for the full year, my expectation is that we will operate at record safety levels, while improving service and bringing more productivity to the bottom line. We are committed to operate a safer railroad for the benefit of all of our stakeholders, our employees, customers, the public and our shareholders. We will remain agile managing network resources in response to dynamic market shifts while handling growth with efficient and reliable service. Our continuous improvement efforts, particularly the UP Way, will generate further efficiency improvements that add value for our customers. And we will continue to make smart capital investments that generate attractive returns by increasing capacity and high-volume quarters, while also supporting our safety, service and productivity initiatives.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRobert M. Knight\nThanks, Lance, and good morning. Before I get started, I'd like to make everyone aware that the 2012 Fact Book will be available tomorrow morning on the Union Pacific website under the Investors tab.\nSo with that, let's start by summarizing our first quarter results. Operating revenue grew 3% to a first quarter record of nearly $5.3 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains. Operating expense totaled $3.7 billion, increasing 2%. Operating income grew 8% to $1.6 billion, also setting a best-ever first quarter mark. Below the line, other income totaled $40 million, up $24 million compared to 2012. A onetime land lease contract settlement added roughly $0.02 in earnings per share compared to last year, which we do not expect to repeat going forward. For the full year, we're projecting other income to be in the $100 million to $120 million range barring any other unusual adjustments.\nInterest expense of $128 million was down $7 million, driven by lower average interest rate of 5.6% compared to 6.1% last year. Income tax expense increased to $588 million, driven by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 11% versus 2012, while the outstanding share balance declined 2% as a result of our share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a first quarter earnings record of $2.03 per share, up 13% versus 2012.\nTurning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 3% to nearly $5 billion. Volume was down a little over 2 points, partially offset by more than a 0.5 point of positive mix. Fuel surcharge recovery added roughly 0.5 point in freight revenue compared to 2012. We also achieved solid core pricing gains of 4%, which was a key contributor to our record first quarter financial performance. Lower coal volumes, again, hindered further pricing gains.\nMoving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides the summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was about flat compared to 2012. Lower volume costs and productivity gains mostly offset inflationary pressures of about 2.5%. And as Lance just discussed, shifts in traffic mix and significant capital replacement work in the South had an impact on operations and associated costs during the quarter.\nWorkforce levels increased 2% in the quarter, mostly driven by a shift in traffic mix to more Manifest business, which require additional resources. Increased capital and Positive Train Control activity also contributed to the growth.\nTurning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $900 million, decreasing $26 million versus 2012. A 5% decline in gross ton-miles drove the reduction in costs. Although our average fuel price was flat year-over-year, our consumption rate increased 3%, mainly driven by lower coal volumes.\nMoving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 6% to $557 million due to higher locomotive and freight car contract repair expenses. In addition, under the new Pacer agreement, we're seeing higher costs in the form of logistics management fees and container costs not incurred under the previous agreement structure. These costs, both the purchased services and equipment rent expense line, and are recouped in our Automotive freight revenue line.\nDepreciation expense increased 2% to $434 million. The impact that increased capital spending in recent years was partially offset by a new equipment rate study that we discussed with you earlier this year. Looking at the full year 2013, we expect depreciation expense to be up in the 2% to 3% range versus 2012.\nSlide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $313 million, up 6% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses and growth in Automotive and Intermodal shipments resulted in higher freight car rental expense. Lower freight car and locomotive lease expense partially offset these increases.\nOther expenses came in at $237 million, up $21 million versus last year. Higher property tax expense and increased equipment and freight damage costs were the primary drivers. Lower personal injury expense partially offset these increases. For the remainder of 2013, we expect the other expense line to moderate slightly, more in the neighborhood of $225 million a quarter barring any unusual items.\nTurning now to our operating ratio performance. For the first time in our history, we achieved sub70 first quarter operating ratio of 69.1%, improving 1.4 points compared to last year. Our performance highlights the positive impact of solid core pricing gains and network efficiency, and is also noteworthy given the fact that we had 2% decline in volume levels this quarter. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving a full year sub-65 operating ratio by 2017.\nUnion Pacific's record first quarter earnings drove strong cash from operations of more than $1.5 billion. Free cash flow of $401 million reflects the 12% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2012.\nOur balance sheet remains strong supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At quarter end, our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 40.2%, which includes our March debt issuance of $650 million. Opportunistic share repurchases continued to play an import rant role in our balanced approach to cash allocations. In the first quarter, we bought back nearly 2.9 million shares, totaling $394 million. Since 2007, we purchased over 94 million shares at an average price of around $80 per share. Looking ahead, we have about 12.2 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.\nSo that's a recap of our first quarter results. Looking at the second quarter. Although our full comparison is much easier, we'll see ongoing challenges with weak grain volumes. However, assuming continued growth in the other market sectors, we would expect our second quarter volumes to be flattish year-over-year.\nAside from volume levels, we'll continue to target inflation-plus pricing gains. We'll also realize the benefits from continued productivity and network efficiency. For the full year, assuming the economy continues along its positive trend with industrial production growth of around 2%, we would expect to see volumes on the positive side of the ledger. We're well-positioned to achieve yet another record financial year, with best ever marks in earnings and operating ratio, driving even greater shareholder returns this year.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back to Jack.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nThanks, Rob. While there is still much uncertainty in the year ahead our diverse franchise does really support our continued focus on profitable growth opportunities. We continued to pursue evolving business development prospects supported by our value proposition and the efficiencies that rail transportation provides. We're also well positioned for upside, but we are just as prepared if our environment should take a turn for the worse. We remain committed to providing safe, efficient, reliable service for our customers to drive greater customer value, and increase shareholder returns in the future.\nSo with that, let's open it up for your questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.\nThomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nI wanted to ask you about one of the popular topics, the crude-by-rail here. How would you view the potential impact of a decline in oil prices and also changes in the WTI brand spread? Or if you look at other spreads that might be helpful for inland crude moves, is that a material source of risk in the near term to volumes? Or are your contracts set up in a way that you have commitments, and so you don't have much sensitivity to the price and the spread moves?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nTom, I think certainly, it depends on the order of magnitude of the moves that were to take place. We don't see anything in the horizon at this point in time that gives us any concern. But Eric, why don't you explain on those?\nEric L. Butler\nTom, there are couple of factors. We've said previously, crude-by-rail provides a great value proposition to the producers in terms of agility, in terms of being able to get to destinations that they previously couldn't get to. So all of that -- those value factors remain. Certainly, if the price of oil goes to levels, pick a number, below 70s, mid-60s, that's going to impact the amount of production, which, as the total production numbers come down, the total numbers that will go crude-by-rail will come down. So that clearly will have an impact if price of oil goes down. In terms of the spreads, we're probably less concerned about the spreads narrowing. Again, as the value proposition we've talked several times in the past publicly with crude-by-rail that, again, gets you to destinations, allows -- the producers flexibility and agility. So we think that even if the spreads get to some narrow -- some low single-digit numbers, there are still a value proposition for crude by rail. The biggest factor is if crude production goes down, then certainly, that impacts us.\nThomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nOkay. And what about the structure of the contracts that you have in place into the St. James market? Are there some commitments that are multi-year where you would have some minimum volumes into those markets? Or is it set up in a way that, if things really changed, that there would necessarily be volume commitments?\nEric L. Butler\nYes. We said, we don't really talk about specific customer agreements. What I would say that you can look at is the fact that the destination providers and the origin producers, they're investing huge dollar amounts of capital to do crude-by-rail, both in terms of freight cars and facilities. So that should be a comforting indicator in terms of their long-term commitment to crude-by-rail.\nOperator\nOur next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.\nKen Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nRob, can you just talk about the outlook there that you just ran through? If you look at truck carloads for the second quarter, do you still see coal moderating? Is Ag accelerating on the downside? Maybe if you can give a little bit more insight onto some color on what's in that in your targets there.\nRobert M. Knight\nYes. Ken, just kind of reiterate what both Eric and I talked about. Keep in mind, as I think you know, the coal falloff that we saw year-over-year in the first quarter being down 19%. Last year, you recall, we sort of hit the trough on coal, so we do have clearly an easier comp on coal as we head into the second quarter. But as Eric mentioned, we do envision that the Ag drought will continue certainly through the second quarter, and we estimate that's going to be down in the, call it, low double digits, which is a little bit worse year-over-year, if you will, compared to what we saw last year. So when you add it all up, the guidance that we're giving is -- assuming all the other markets remain about constant with what we saw in the first quarter, that feels flattish to us. But full year, again, if the economy continues to cooperate, which thus far it is, all of those things will sort of neutralize, if you will, when we get to back half of the year. We think at the end of the day, at the end of the year, we'll have volumes that, overall, on a positive side of the ledger.\nKen Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nOkay. And If I can do my follow-up on pricing. Was there any -- on the coal side, were there any contract settlements within that -- within the yields? And then also within pricing, you mentioned the Pacer agreement a couple of times. Can you kind of talk about or walk through the level of increase? I know you don't like talking about specific contracts, but maybe just magnitude of what we're looking at or continued to go forward on that contract? And then similarly on pricing on Domestic Intermodal side, I think you mentioned it was flat. Can you just kind of run through what you're seeing impact on those -- on that as well?\nRobert M. Knight\nKen, this is Rob. Let me take the first point, and you asked about the settlements in the Coal line. There's a little bit in there. We're not calling out precisely what it is. But it's a little bit of an impact on the ARC and the coal. And in terms of the other pricing discussions, we don't break out by  -- we don't talk about pricing on particular arrangements or agreements. So Ken, I'm not sure what your question was.\nKen Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nI guess you mentioned that the Auto pricing was up significantly because of the Pacer agreement, so you kind of called it out on there. I mean, can you give us, I guess, an understanding of what Auto would be like without the agreement? I mean, it was a big number in terms of the 10% increase. Is it half of that in terms of magnitude?\nRobert M. Knight\nKen, this is Rob again. I mean, the impact on the Autos ARC of that new agreement, it's a 50-50 [ph] in that number. So clearly, it's deflated [ph], if you will, the ARC number. But that pacer agreement, as I think, everybody is aware, as previously announced, is really kind of a neutralizing effect. I mean, it's showing up both on the revenue and expense line, but it doesn't change the full year economics to us, the bottom line. But there is a positive impact that's showing up in that ARC number on the Autos line. And you will see that, full year.\nKen Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nOkay. And then lastly, just on the Domestic Intermodal, as you had mentioned, something on [ph] flat there. I just wanted to understand that as well.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nDomestic Intermodal.\nRobert M. Knight\nYes. We are continuing to see strength in our Domestic Intermodal business at the minute [ph]. I think I mentioned our conversion strategy is going well. We're continuing to price with the market, and we're continuing to be pleased with the performance in that business.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nThe volume was flat in the first quarter, Ken. Is that -- was that your question?\nKen Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nOh, it's volume, okay. It's not price, yes.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nIt's volume, not price.\nRobert M. Knight\nKen, this is Rob. If I can just make one clarifying point on the Pacer questions you asked. I said that the Autos ARC reflected that this new agreement, but it's not reflected in our 4% core pricing number that we report. That's not -- that doesn't factor anything related in that number.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.\nScott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.\nSo I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of those things from the last question. With the coal yields being so strong, if it's not legacy repricing, can you give us a sense of maybe what's driving that strength and if you think it's sustainable? And then, Rob, you mentioned that you're getting good coal yields even without the volume. As the volume starts to come back, can the coal yields -- or should they get even better from what we found in the first quarter?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nScott, when you look at the pricing of our coal overall, there was some legacy impact from prior contracts that have been settled, and there was also -- that's the normal escalations that we have in our new contracts going forward. There were some incremental fuel surcharge. There was a little bit of liquidated damages, but not very much. So that's really it.\nRobert M. Knight\nScott, if I  can just make one comment. The ARC number that we reported in the first quarter for -- in addition to the comments that Jack just mentioned, there is the mix effect in there. So that -- again, if you look at our overall pricing as an enterprise, we report a 4% price. And as I mentioned in my comments, it's hindered somewhat by the lack of volume in coal. But if you're searching [indiscernible], we don't break it out by commodities what the pricing actually was. But it is appropriate to take into consideration that the ARC number we reported in coal did have some mixed effect in it.\nScott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.\nSo when you add up all those kind of moving parts of maybe some liquidated damages that don't continue, and maybe coal coming back in some parts of the network, is this kind of double-digit run rate on ARC still sustainable for the year?\nRobert M. Knight\nIt will depend upon the mix. Again, what we're looking at overall in our pricing is to be inflation plus kind of pricing overall, and that's how we approach the business overall. But when you look any individual commodity groups ARC, you can get swings either way depending on the mix of traffic that we move that quarter.\nScott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.\nThat makes sense. And just last thing on the Domestic Intermodal. I'm a little confused if you're talking about the highway conversions going well, but domestic volumes were flat. What's offsetting that in the quarter? And just any color you can give us there would be great.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nEric?\nEric L. Butler\nYes. As I mentioned, in a couple of select markets, there were some competitive select markets that had some volume reductions and...\nJohn J. Koraleski\nHey, Scott, let me take you back to our past comments, which is, as we take our prices up, there are some business is that's going to fall away from the railroad because it doesn't meet our reinvestable standards. And so we saw some of that. So we were taking some prices up, we've got some new business in highway conversions and we lost some business that needed our reinvestability threshold.\nOperator\nOur next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division\nI wanted to ask a question on the cost side. When we look at compensation and benefits, it's actually been flat to down for the last 4 quarters or so. How should we think about headcounts and wage inflation, and some of the offsetting efficiencies that you're getting in the network for the rest of the year?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nRob?\nRobert M. Knight\nThe way we -- the guidance that we've given on the head -- let's me start with the headcount question first. Overall headcount for the year, we would expect to float with volume. So again, our projection is that, assuming the economy cooperates, that our volume will be on the positive side of ledger. So the way I would look at it is that we expect volume to be up year-over-year, but not necessarily 1:1 because there is certainly productivity savings we will achieve throughout the year. On the cost side, the way I think I would guide you to look at, the way I would expect cost to flow through is we think our labor inflation is going to be around 3%. There were some timing issues that resulted in it being flat, you're right, this quarter end, a previous couple of quarters. But probably the right way to look at it is expect that, that inflation on the wage lines would be around 3% going forward.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nRob, one other thing to note and we mentioned it in our commentary, headcount will also flux with CapEx and with mix shift to manifest.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division\nFrom that guidance, Rob, then, I mean, should we be looking for more normal comp and then inflation of 3% throughout the year, I mean, depending obviously on the volume outlook then?\nRobert M. Knight\nI think that's the right way to look at it.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division\nOkay. And then quickly on purchase services. You mentioned that the Pacer agreement did escalate costs there. Is that the new run rate that we saw in the quarter for the rest of the year as well?\nRobert M. Knight\nThere could be lots of factors. Obviously, volume overall will play a part in there. But that particular item that we saw in the first quarter will repeat throughout the year.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.\nWilliam J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nJack or Rob, can I just ask you to comment a little bit on the return of capital approach? When you think about sort of the circumstances that might cause you to be a little bit more aggressive there or maybe change the way you think about leverage, because I know you do debt-to-capital. But I think if you look at it on a debt-to-EBITDA basis or in interest coverage basis, you've been pretty conservatively levered. So maybe you can just comment a little bit on what's circumstance you might be willing to be more aggressive in that regard?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nRob?\nRobert M. Knight\nYes. Bill, I mean, as we've said before, we haven't changed our approach. We don't look at just debt-to-cap because we use that as one of the measures that we talk publicly about. We look at all the measures. But where it all starts is we're focus on generating the cash, to begin with. We'll continue then to deploy the cash by making investments in capital projects where we're confident the returns there. We expect [ph] the 30% payout on the dividends, so we would expect that as earnings continue to grow, we expect the dividends to continue to grow along with it. And then we will continue to be opportunistic on the share repurchase activities that, in fact, we've been deploying for the last X number of years. So in terms of when you add it all up, Bill, as you've heard me say before, we are still comfortable in that 40s -- low 40s debt-to-cap ratio. That's not how we drive our business, but that's the kind of resulting measure that we are still very comfortable with it.\nWilliam J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nOkay. Rob, you also made a comment in your comments about core price, and I just want to make sure I understood it, and that is that some of the coal that's repriced didn't move, and I think, if we think back to '12, that kind of caused the reported core price metric to be a little bit lower in light of otherwise been the case. Was that a material impact this quarter again? I would have thought we're certain to lap it, but maybe you can just give a little clarity there.\nRobert M. Knight\nYes, Bill, compared to sort of normal run rates, which is always the elusive part of that calculation, we call it about 0.5 point of price that did not materialize, had the higher levels of coal volume moved under those repriced contracts. So we reported 4% core price had it been sort of normal run rates of volumes in the coal world on those repriced contracts, it would've looked more like 4.5.\nWilliam J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nAll right. And then one last one just on nat gas, how soon is it at nat gas prices like this when we see the customers start to react? Is that a lag of like 6 months or 12 months? How do we think about that?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nBill, actually, overall, we have seen customers start to make the shift back from natural gas to coal. The bigger problem right at the moment is there's not much demand for electricity or the demand for electricity is softer. So even though we've actually seen some customers start shifting back and taking more coal, we have not seen a substantial increase in coal shipments yet.\nEric L. Butler\nIf -- this is Eric. If you look back at last year this time, coal market share of electrical generation was down in the low 30% -- it's probably 32%, 33%, 34%. Today, it's about 40%. So clearly coal has regained market share at 4, 4.20 natural gas. As Jack said, the demand for overall electrical generation is still down as the economy is still coming back. And we're in shelf months in terms of weather patterns. So both of those are impacting the overall electrical demand.\nOperator\nOur next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.\nRobert Salmon\nIt's Rob on for Justin. Eric, could you talk a little bit more with regard to your coal outlook? This morning, Peabody raised their expectation in terms of the coal burn by about $20 million on both the high and low end for the U.S. What sort of growth are you guys expecting in terms of consumption across your utilities, and would that imply upside to what's baked into your guidance currently?\nRobert M. Knight\nI think -- and, Rob, in our comments, we kind of indicated -- we said flat to slightly increase from the second quarter with the easier comps. The fundamental issue really is going to come down to the overall demand, and then how competitive coal will be against the natural gas. So you need the economy to come back strong. You need the large steel mills to start using electrical generation. You need normal weather patterns in the summer. And as all of those things happen, you'll see the demand for electricity go up. And again, as I said, current natural -- current coal market share has grown back to 40%. It will never get back to the 50%, that it historically was, but it's better than the low-30s. So I haven't seen that Peabody outlook. But my guess is that they're expecting normal weather patterns and continued economic growth in the economy to drive electrical demand.\nRobert Salmon\nNo, that's fair. Coal's always a tough one to model. Looking forward, I guess, Rob, circling back on Bill Greene's prior question. When you're saying with coal getting back to kind of normal type burn levels, would flat year-over-year in Q2 imply normal coal levels and we should be thinking about kind of a 4.5% core improvement looking forward?\nRobert M. Knight\nIt's always difficult to predict what normal is. But we are assuming, as Eric said, the positive news of coal being a greater market share. We do have the easier comp. And if volumes materialize, we would hope to see that in our margins on that business that we've repriced. So I guess I would say that we are looking at things to be more normal as we look out for the balance of the year.\nRobert Salmon\nThat's helpful. And I guess before I turn it over, Lance, if you could talk to the Intermodal train length extension, you saw over kind of 2% year-over-year improvement on Intermodal boxes. Could you talk how that played out on both the domestic and the international train starts across your Intermodal franchise?\nLance M. Fritz\nSure. Off the top of my head, I do not have the detail on how that splits out between the 2. I can tell you that we do have sized opportunities on both. I would say they're probably more on the domestic side. But we've got plenty of train size opportunity both sides.\nOperator\nOur next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.\nChristian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division\nMaybe just a question on the coal inventories. Eric, I know you mentioned that they're still elevated, could you just give us a rough sense of kind of where they stand relative to historical norms? I mean, are we still pretty far away from getting back to normalized levels?\nEric L. Butler\nYes. So the numbers haven't come out for the latest month. But as of the numbers that came out in March, they still showed overall for the whole country, 11 days above normal. There's probably some pretty wide swings in that number between Eastern utilities and Western utilities. I would expect a large number of the utilities in our serving area are putting -- getting pretty close to normal. There are probably some that are below normal because they've taken some aggressive inventory actions. So I would expect that we can see next month as the number come out, you'll see some pretty normal and may even perhaps below normal inventory numbers.\nChristian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division\nOkay. And is there any reason to think that the level of what should be normal changes at all going forward just with the relationship between natural gas and kind of where we are currently with the shale activity, or kind of old normal is the right way to think about it?\nEric L. Butler\nYes. I don't really see a huge change for the coal-centric utilities. They're still -- it's in their best interest to burn coal, and they're in essence competing against the natural gas-centric utilities. And so they're going to get their burn patterns up and they need a certain run rate to protect their burn pattern, to protect against outages. So I don't see a significant shift in what has been historical normal inventory patterns for coal-centric utilities.\nChristian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division\nOkay, that's helpful. And I just want to come back to, and I apologize, just on the mix aspect within coal yields. I'm trying to get kind of a handle on how to think about that. Can you give us a little bit of color of what kind of drives the big mix changes? It's just seeing more volume that had been repriced, legacy volume that have been repriced moving relative to other business within the commodity group, or I guess we're just trying to think about how to project this out in the next couple of quarters. So if there's any little bit of color around the positive mix dynamic in the first quarter would be helpful.\nEric L. Butler\nYes. So when we talk about mix, we're talking about the mix of Southern Powder River Basin coal, Colorado/Utah coal, export coal, et cetera. And so if you look at some of the places where there are volume -- volume reductions, we've had positive mix in other areas because of some of the new Southern Powder River Basin coal opportunity that we have.\nOperator\nOur next question is coming from the line of Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nChristopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\nSo not to beat a dead horse, but I do have a couple of follow-ups on coal. First of all, can you just give us a ballpark out of the, let's say, 19 percentage point decline that you had in coal in Q1? How much of that was associated with the loss business? Was it 5 points out of the 19 or something in that neighborhood?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nRob?\nEric L. Butler\nYes, Chris, the contract that we've spoken about previously was about 5 percentage points on the volume.\nChristopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\nOkay. And then if I kind of put together all the things that you've talked about so far that coal is back up to 40% of the burn, that inventories at the utilities in the west are back to normal or maybe below normal, your comps are getting easier. If we start to see increased volumes of coal, should we expect that the pricing gets better because you'll start to move some of the stuff that you didn't move last year, where you had recontracted at higher rates?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nIt's really largely dependent on which customers grow, and what areas and how those kind of play themselves out.\nEric L. Butler\nAnd again, as we've talked in the past about our pricing calculations, certain things may not come up in our pricing calculations, but they will show in improved margins as repriced business that those volumes come back, you'll see that in our margins even if you don't see it in our pricing calculation.\nChristopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\nOkay. And then just one follow-up. The depreciation, bonus depreciation, Rob, what -- how much of a drag on cash flow do you think that might be for UP in 2013 versus 2012?\nRobert M. Knight\nOf course, as you know, we're getting still the benefit in 2013 of 50% bonus depreciation. So, which is what it was last year. So that is not a huge driver in 2013. But starting in 2014, we'll start to feel the impact of -- assuming there's no bonus depreciation beyond '13, we'll start to feel more of an impact. There's a slight benefit this year when you add it all up.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nJust wanted to follow up again on the Intermodal side. I think when we look at the highway conversion opportunity, I think, largely, the assumption has been that given your length of haul, you have somewhat less of an opportunity than perhaps some of your eastern peers. Have you looked at the market for hauls of above, say, 500 or 600 miles to address what that upside opportunity is, and can you share that with us if you had a look at that?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nSure, we have. Eric?\nEric L. Butler\nWalter, I guess I'm not necessarily sure I'm tracking why a longer length of haul should result in fewer opportunity. We actually think the opposite that longer length of haul should result in more opportunities. The current total size of our Intermodal book of business is about 3 million units a year, closely equally divided between domestic and international. We size the domestic attainable market opportunity, and we talked about this in Dallas, I think, last fall. We size that as somewhere around 10 million units. Now, not all of that will be easy to convert. If you look at customers, there's a stratification of large, mid-sized and smaller customers. The large customers, the Walmarts, the Targets of the world, they are very intermodal centric already because they see the benefits of Intermodal. They could tune their supply chains to Intermodal. If you go to the mid-sized and smaller customers, we certainly -- that's the target rich environment, and we're working aggressively to sell the value of Intermodal to them, and some of that requires them to tune their supply chains a little differently, but that's the market opportunity, the business development opportunity, and frankly, why we're so excited about the future potential.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nAnd Walter, when Eric talks about the 10 million opportunity, that does not include another 2.5 million to 3 million trucks that moves back and forth between Mexico and the United States. And as you know, we're building a new Intermodal facility down in Santa Teresa to really target that Northern Mexico, the maquiladoras and those kinds of things, which will hopefully make a dent in that 2.5 million to 3 million unit opportunity as well.\nWalter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nThat's great color. Can you give us a sense of the available capacity on average of your Intermodal trains? Roughly how much incremental volume could we see go onto your new -- or Intermodal network without at fairly high incremental margin?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nSure, how about Lance?\nLance M. Fritz\nSure. So again, that depends very much on the length that the opportunity show up in. But just giving you an aggregate sense, I think we've averaged, what, 170 units a train in the first quarter, and most of our lanes could probably handle 250 plus/minus units. Again, very dependent on where it shows up and lanes specific.\nWalter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nAnd you're fully -- - double-stack capable roughly your network?\nLance M. Fritz\nVirtually everywhere.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.\nCherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research\nI just had a question about your Ag business. Obviously, the USDA is forecasting some pretty large crops this year. I just wonder as you look out over your draw territory, what's your read on soil moisture conditions and I guess, the risk of continued dryness in some areas and floods in others?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nWell, I tell you what, right here in Nebraska, after the past month or so, we're about ready to stick a fork in this drought. We've had some nice heavy rains and heavy snows and things like that. And hopefully, that is doing its job in terms of replenishing the moisture content ground. Eric, you want to put some technical around that?\nEric L. Butler\nYes, if you look at last year, Cheryl, the USDA said last year was going to be 1 of the 5 best years in all of history, and then we know what happened. So I take forecast with a grain of salt that this time of the year simply because so much of it is weather dependent. As Jack said, it appears to be a great start in our growing season, nice moisture in our key breadbaskets, we're all excited about that. We're not out of the woods yet, and we do need it to continue. And you not only need it certainly for the spring planting season, but you also need moisture in the critical parts of the heat of the summer. So there's a long tail left before we can feel comfortable about the predictions of what will happen in the harvest at the late -- latter part of the year.\nCherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research\nOkay. And switching gears, just in terms of the public crossing accidents that you're experiencing in the South, which is really a function of your growth there and the whole region's growth, how disruptive for you from an operational standpoint are those? And how quickly do you think you can bring that back down?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nOkay, Lance?\nLance M. Fritz\nYes, sure. Excellent question. And just to predicate, this is an extremely frustrating statistic for us. We've been working very hard on impacting the trend for the past several years particularly down in Texas. The short answer on how disruptive, it varies, but generally speaking, it's a couple hours of downtime as the accident gets investigated and cleaned up. So they are -- they have an impact. It's variability. It's not same order of magnitude typically as a derailment. And in terms of when can we start moving the needle on the number, I'm telling you we're doing everything in our power right now to try to impact that number. As we look at it in large aggregate, we're about on top of last year's statistics. They're pretty volatile. So what you saw in the first quarter is a little degradation. But in general, absolute number, we're a bit worse but trying to navigate on top of last year's number. It involves a lot of things like an audit and blitz of our railroad to find where the risk is. The risk moves and grows rapidly with development of industry around us and in engaging the local authorities to care as deeply about the issue as we do to impact driver behavior. So there's a lot of activity going on there.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nThat's a very difficult issue, and sometimes, you just -- I was surprised actually that we don't have the power to even put a stop sign up without getting the approval of local authorities, and sometimes, they just say no. So there are some pretty significant obstacles out there towards changing driver behavior and getting everybody on the same page as we are as to how important this is.\nOperator\nOur next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nThomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nI'd like to follow up on the comment about cross-border. Can you just remind us how much Mexico contributes to the bottom line presently? And given the tremendous growth prospects, what do you think it might look like over the next few years?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nRob?\nRobert M. Knight\nYes. Tom, we don't give the bottom line, but I'll give you the top line. It represents about 10% of our business levels currently, and it's been growing nicely the last several years across the board. The mix of the commodities has been growing at a pace greater than our overall volumes have been growing.\nThomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nOkay. And then just a more housekeeping-related question. With regard to the $40 million in other income, we estimate that -- I think you mentioned land sales contributed about $0.02 a share, what's the remainder of the $40 million?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nRob?\nRobert M. Knight\nMiscellaneous transactions. I don't -- I wouldn't call anything out in particular that was driving that. That's relatively -- the balance would represent a relatively normal run rate for us.\nOperator\nOur next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen.\nJason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division\nI guess my questions more longer term here. I look at your 65% OR target by 2017, and to me, it seems fairly attainable. I mean, you just reported a first quarter that had fewer working days in it, you had a record OR, coal's under pressure, Ag's under pressure. Talk to me about that goal that you have out there and what some of your underlying assumptions are in terms of some of the commodity groups and also your core pricing which also seems fairly strong x coal at 4.5%.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nSure, we think it's attainable, too. Rob?\nRobert M. Knight\nJason, I mean, you've heard me say this over the years. I mean, it's not an end game, it's the next target that we've put out there, not unlike when we set the original 75% target. We got there as efficiently as we could and got there a little early. Then we set the low 70s, got there as efficiently as we could and got there a little early. We hope to get to this -- the previous sub 67% earlier as we mentioned last fall, and I'd say the same -- make the same comment about the sub 65%. So we're going to get there the same way we're going from where we are today to the sub 65% is the same way we got from the high 80s down to where we are today. And that is efficient safe operations, leveraging productivity, providing great service to our customers allows us to price it fairly. Fuel can obviously be a whipsaw on us, depending on what fuel does in terms in the calculation on the operating ratio. But I would just take comfort that we're going to -- that our assumption is a normal economy. If the economy cooperates and fuel prices are normal, if you will, and we're going to go after it as efficiently and as quickly as we can.\nJason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division\nAnd in terms of your assumptions for coal and its market share versus nat gas in that 65% OR?\nRobert M. Knight\nI mean, we don't get into that level of detail other than I would say, it's sort of a normal. I mean, we certainly think that Powder River Basin Coal is here to stay perhaps at lower levels than what we historically experienced, but our assumption is that it's sort of a normal from here on out if you will.\nJason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And my follow-up question, on your Southern region, it seems like you had a little bit of challenges operationally. And is it starting to feel better already in 2Q, and how should we look at that throughout the year?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nSure. Lance?\nLance M. Fritz\nYes. It is starting to look better. The actions that I mentioned in my comments regarding utilizing fluid routes, terminals, making sure we adjusted our resources rapidly, that made a difference in the tail end of March, and we're looking much more favorable in the South right now in the first few weeks of this quarter.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nPlus, we had our maintenance programs were very heavy in the first quarter, that was planned. Those are now starting to be completed and some additional capacity projects coming on as we go through the year with capital, and each one of those adds a margin of fluidity and improvement in our variability.\nJason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division\nOkay. So all things being equal, we should start seeing that come out in your weekly performance numbers?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nYes, I expect so.\nOperator\nOur next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.\nKeith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division\nThis is probably related to Jason's question there, I guess, on how the improvements were accomplished in the Southern region fluidity, but related of years' $1 billion or so growth in productivity CapEx, at this point, can you cite a couple of projects that are perhaps most material likely to impact income or ROIC over the rest of the year and next?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nLance?\nLance M. Fritz\nSure. So we've got some new capacity and commercial facility spending, that will have some impact. We've got a very large facility in Santa Teresa. It includes an Intermodal ramp that we think is going to really aid what Jack talked about in terms of cross-border truck traffic and conversion to Intermodal, plus a fueling facility. We've got some excellent work going on in terms of more fluid operations to our crude oil destinations. We should see benefits of that over the years. We've got capacity that's being spent up in the northern tier of our network, as well as in Texas to enable incremental, more fluid frac sand movement. We've really got it spread all over the railroad, largely concentrated in Texas from Louisiana, but there are key projects all over the railroad that are unlocking critical pieces of capacity for us.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nThere are some things, Keith, that we have kind of scaled back given the volumes that we're seeing and in the way the economy is running like for instance, the double tracking of the Sunset Corridor, where we're 70% done with that and -- but we're pacing it a little differently to watch in terms of the volume, but long-term potential is the ability to take that from 55 trains a day to 90, which would be a huge step forward for us. We have the Mississippi River bridge that we're continuing to work on, that is a key bottleneck that would be eliminated as we go through that project. In the Blair -- we have a Blair cutoff that is not order of magnitude, that big, but anything that would save 3 to 4 hours of transit time on the trains that go through our Central Corridor to Chicago eventually helps the bottom line enormously.\nKeith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division\nOkay. And maybe a one quick shorter-term question perhaps for Eric. We're seeing stronger growth in housing at last. Lumber improved 18% probably as a result of that. Could you comment on where and how material housing improvements are showing up elsewhere, be it light trucks, some Intermodal, et cetera?\nEric L. Butler\nGreat question. We're excited about the housing improvement finally. It -- housing is actually running ahead of the original Global Insight estimates, and I think the housing or the lumber producers are pretty positive about the trends that they're seeing and the housing start numbers that they're seeing. Housing, in addition to impacting lumber, it's also going to impact our Intermodal business. As you know, once homes are built, you have to furnish them. And so both on the International Intermodal business and the Domestic Intermodal business, we think that housing will have an impact on that. We think housing will also have an impact on ancillary business like our steel wheel book rebar business, which goes into construction. Our cement business, our cement business, we think that that will strengthen as housing strengthen. So all of those are things that will go as housing goes.\nKeith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division\nEric, it sounds like you're using future tense though, that those are still sort of pending improvements, am I reading that correctly?\nEric L. Butler\nNo. I've been around here long enough. I remember when housing was regularly 1.7 million, 1.8 million starts a year, so even though we're back up to around 970 off a low of -- below 600, 970 still feels low to me. So I will feel like it's back regular normal when it gets above 1.3, 1.4, 1.5.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nBut if you look, Keith, like in our cement business, I think it was up about 6% in the first quarter. Our plastics business, which include things like PVC pipe and those kinds of things that they're using in housing construction were also up in the first quarter. So we are seeing the residual impact that goes along with the incremental lumber.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of John Mims of FBR Capital Markets.\nJohn R. Mims - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division\nJust one quick one for me just this late in the call. Eric, I stepped away for a minute, could you repeat what you were saying about International Intermodal, and maybe add to any comments related to outlook for any sort of a peak season in '13?\nEric L. Butler\nWhat I was talking about International Intermodal is that as housing starts increase, you need to furnish the homes, and so we do see a trend between International Intermodal upswing as housing start improves, that was the connection that I was making. Last year, what we said was that it was a muted peak season. I think we used those words last year. It's early in the year, and it's -- at this point in the year, what happens, and peak will determine on the economic conditions, consumer confidence, retail sales, all of those things will determine kind of what happens in peak volumes.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nRight now, we are expecting the Intermodal peak to be stronger than last year. The order of magnitude is -- we're not sure we'll get it, really depends a lot -- bidding season is just coming in right now for a lot of those international contracts between the retailers and the ocean carriers and things like that, so there's still a lot to be determined in terms of how that'll play out for the summer.\nJohn R. Mims - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division\nRight. Okay. So as of right now, though, it's still just more of a read on the macro versus you having real conversations as far as staging capacity with the liners or with the major shippers?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nRight, that's right.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.\nBenjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nJust to expound on that, I guess, this 8% growth in the first quarter, I'm assuming that's not a run rate for the balance of the year, and that the first quarter, you did benefit to some degree from certain shippers shifting away from the East Coast to the West Coast ahead of any sort of East Coast ILA strike during the first quarter. Is that the right? Is that the right way to think about the volume, the first quarter volume?\nRobert M. Knight\nYes. We do not expect to see that kind of run rate for the year. There was some nominal impact of shifts from the East Coast, but very small. The bigger factor frankly was the timing of the Chinese Lunar New Year this year versus last year, and there was some advanced shipping because of that, that was probably the larger impact. Plus we did see an impact -- inventories were pretty thin after the holiday season last year. And you did see an impact of inventory catch-up by -- in January.\nBenjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nOkay, good. And then on the coal side, I know you kind of earmarked a number of different various items that drove RPU above expectations to the $2,300 level. Is this a good level to be thinking about then? I mean, you kind of -- you hit on mixed legacy, fuel surcharge and some liquidated[ph] damages as well driving that number. But is this $2,300 level a good level to think about for coal as it relates to RPU for the balance of the year?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nRob?\nRobert M. Knight\nAs we indicated in some previous discussions, I'd be careful using a run rate of ARC because mix can have such an impact on that, up or down. So again, we're going to aggressively go after providing the good service and repricing where we can, but the ARC number can move on you.\nOperator\nOur next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel.\nJohn G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division\nMaybe more of a conceptual question on the Intermodal side. The UP's service levels have improved dramatically over the last 10 years or so and have generally caught up to the other big Western railroad. And I guess the question is, as you see the service levels right now, where do you think you have a competitive advantage versus the competitor, where do you think the competitor has an advantage? Is that how you think of marketing the service, in particular, power lanes where you might have better on-time performance or a better velocity? And based on some of the investments that you're putting into the ground now, will you see that competitive positioning change at all here over the next couple of years?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nYes, Eric?\nEric L. Butler\nYes, so good question. To start with, we -- as we look at our Intermodal network, we are actually proud of the fact, we go to many more places than our competitor in the West in terms of our franchise, in terms of origin destination points where we have service, too. And that's really the power of the diversity of our franchise. We just get to and from many more places than the customer base. A large portion of the customer base does see value in that. Having said that, for the places where we do compete head to head, we kind of assess where we are very regularly. And we are pleased that in most of the places where we compete head to head, we think our service is as good or materially better, and the majority of the places where we compete head to head. There are a couple of places where our competitor has a slight advantage, and we are continuing to put initiatives and strategies in place to ensure that we have the best service in the industry.\nJohn G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division\nAnd then maybe one question that you don't need to answer if you don't want to, but I'll ask it anyway. With respect to operating ratio as the key metric to focus on for the future, you've said again here today, that you believe you'll get to a 65% or lower for the full year 2017, that seems like a very achievable target as one of the other analysts mentioned. But what happens if in 2016, Eric, comes to Jack with a $400 million project that has a 68% operating ratio on it, does that put you in the position of, perhaps, saying no to that project, or do you feel as though you can still accommodate that and access that incremental traffic? Would return on invested capital be a better measure or some other measure that takes into account, the generation of free cash flow? Just conceptual thought in terms of whether operating ratio is the correct metric?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nJohn, when we look at business opportunities at a high level and at a specific level, we're really focused on the reinvestability of the business, our ability to provide good, efficient, safe and consistent service for that customer. And then we deal with it on that basis in terms of the acquisition or whether we take on the business or not. We don't really think about it in terms of the operating ratio. But I will turn that over to Rob in terms of broader discussion of the key measures.\nRobert M. Knight\nYes. John, I mean I get your point. And I would say that we set operating ratio target out there just as a way of kind of speaking in our organization as setting our mind towards making financial improvement. But at the end of today, it's focused on returns. So we know we still got room to go in improving our operating ratio, which will improve our earnings, which improves our cash, which if we do all the investments correctly, improves our returns. So they all kind of go together. But at the end of the day, it's the improving our returns.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nIt's a really portfolio of measures.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.\nJeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division\nIt's been a long call and most of mine have been answered, so let me just throw a quick one out there. I see the carloads for the crude business, if I thought about that in terms of trains per day and how to allocate those carloads, roughly how many trains a day are you doing in the crude business relative to how many trains a day for the system total? And is it fair to assume, this would be the follow-up, that it's longer haul business, and therefore, a higher RPU than your average chemical RPU?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nLance?\nLance M. Fritz\nSure. Trains per day were in the 5 plus/minus ballpark. Length to haul...\nJohn J. Koraleski\n750 miles.\nLance M. Fritz\nYes.\nJeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division\nAll right. And how many trains per day for the total network?\nLance M. Fritz\nIn the total network, boy, varies by day a week and moment in time. But for instance, right now, we probably have 820 trains on our network.\nJeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division\nPer day?\nEric L. Butler\nExcuse me, you're asking a question that I don't think I can answer because the question I just gave you was terminating or originating trains per day on crude, and the trains per day in the network I look at as inventory. So I really can't answer your question the way you've asked it.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nSo Rob, I noted here you're talking about a new equipment rate study on the depreciation line. Did that lower the rate that you guys are depreciating the equipment at for -- on a-go forward basis? So if you could add some color to that?\nRobert M. Knight\nYes. So I mean, the result of the study was elongated, if you will, the depreciation on those assets, combine that with the fact that we're running a fewer gross ton miles, resulted in a lower depreciation rate than what we've previously experienced.\nDavid Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nI think it was 5 -- the depreciation was 5.6% in the last Q. Is it -- can -- do you know the number off the top of your head, or should we just wait for the Q?\nRobert M. Knight\nIn the first quarter, depreciation rate was 3%.\nDavid Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n3%, okay. And the fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter?\nRobert M. Knight\nI'm sorry?\nDavid Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nFuel surcharge revenue in the quarter?\nRobert M. Knight\nAbout 0.5 point on the revenue line.\nDavid Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\n0.5 point on the revenue line, okay.\nOperator\nOur next question is from the line of Justin Long of Stephens.\nJustin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division\nIn the quarter, your volumes were down a little over 3% sequentially, but operating expenses were up nearly 4% if you look on a sequential basis. Just on a high level, can you talk about some of the puts and takes that drove that discrepancy, and would you say that's not a trend you would expect going forward?\nRobert M. Knight\nMix is always a factor in that particular calculation when you look at car loading sequentially and the expense going forward. So I guess I would say that take the guidance that we've given you in terms of the components as best you can as best way of looking at it rather than trying to calculate that particular sequential relationship.\nJustin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division\nOkay, fair enough. And then as a follow-up, could you comment briefly on CapEx and remind me where you stand from a railcar equipment perspective, and any investments you might need to make there given your volume outlook for the remainder of the year?\nJohn J. Koraleski\nSure. Our current CapEx is targeted at about $3.6 billion for the year, which is down just a bit from last year. It does include some equipment acquisitions that are needed for our business growth and replacements of retiring assets. If you had some specific question beyond that?\nJustin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division\nMaybe specifically, on the car types that you're looking to purchase this year.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nLance?\nLance M. Fritz\nSure. We're picking up some auto rack. We're picking up some food-grade covered hoppers. we're picking up a handful of other types. Some...\nJohn J. Koraleski\nRefrigerated boxcars and some containers.\nRobert M. Knight\nAnd John, it's -- it's less than $200 million of \tthe $3.6 billion just to kind of size if for you.\nOperator\nThank you. We've come to the end of our time for the questions and answers today. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.\nJohn J. Koraleski\nWell, great. Thanks so much for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you again in July.\nOperator\nThank you. And this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\n\n",

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis.\nThe presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com.\nAt this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer, and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements, today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, November 1, 2018. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. In 2018, we have been making significant effort to support future growth with investment in the business. We are allocating more resources to critical R&D projects, updating and expanding many of our manufacturing capabilities and investing in key areas such as diagnostics with the recent acquisition of Abaxis. We are making good progress integrating Abaxis. Our sales teams have been cross-trained on Zoetis' and Abaxis' product lines in the U.S. and Canada, and they're already collaborating on customer accounts. Outside of the U.S. we are focused on building a more robust diagnostic team and using the existing Zoetis infrastructure to expand our diagnostics sales.\nThe initial feedback on the acquisition has been very good. Our field force has been very positive about the potential of this combination and the more comprehensive solutions they can now bring to our veterinary customers. Early customer response has been very encouraging. Our core business and investment strategy has Zoetis well-positioned for the future with a diverse portfolio addressing needs across the continuum of care and a promising pipeline of new products and lifecycle innovations.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, we have taken a phased filing approach for a new three-way combination parasiticide, and we continue making that progress. The product will be known by the trade name Simparica Trio, and it will combine sarolaner and two other active ingredients to focus on ectoparasites such as fleas, ticks and mites as well as internal parasites and the prevention of heartworm disease.\nOur phased regulatory filings are progressing in the U.S. The safety, efficacy and chemistry manufacturing and control technical sections are under FDA review. In addition, we have submitted the dossier with the European Medicines Agency and subject to regulatory reviews and approval, we would anticipate Simparica Trio coming to market in 2020. We are also progressing well with our monoclonal antibodies program, targeting pain treatment for dogs and cats. This will strengthen our leadership position for pain in dogs and allow us to expand into cats. I will provide further updates as we move through the regulatory process.\nOur R&D team also continues to enhance our internal portfolio with lifecycle innovations and additional product indication such as the recent expansion of Cytopoint to cover allergic as well as atopic dermatitis in the U.S., also introducing of leading product brands into new geographies and new combinations.\nNow turning to a few highlights of our third quarter results. Zoetis continued delivering strong revenue growth with 12% operational growth this quarter. Our diverse portfolio remains the foundation of Zoetis' steady and reliable performance with growth across our major species, markets and therapeutic areas. Our companion animal products performed very well in the third quarter based on continued growth in our key dermatology brands, new parasiticides and, for the first time, the addition of Abaxis diagnostic portfolio.\nWe see further growth opportunities for our key dermatology products in 2019. In the U.S., we expect that portfolio to continue growing although at a lower rate than 2018. We expect to continue expanding the addressable market in the U.S. and building awareness of dermatologic conditions through ongoing direct-to-consumer campaigns. Internationally, we expect higher growth than in the U.S. driven by the expansion of the dermatology market, increasing the patient share and the potential introduction of Apoquel in China, pending final regulatory approval.\nMeanwhile, in livestock products, our swine, poultry and fish portfolios each delivered double-digit growth, with more modest growth in our cattle business. We expect all our species categories to show growth for the full year 2018 and also for 2019. For 2019, analysts expect the companion animal and poultry markets to outperform the overall industry growth of approximately 5%, excluding the currency impact. Swine is expected to be in line with the market growth, and cattle market growth is expected to be more limited.\nTurning to profitability, in the third quarter we achieved 32% operational growth in adjusted net income, thanks to our increased revenue, improved cost structure, and tax reform. In closing, in 2018 we are confident in achieving our improved annual guidance, continuing to grow revenue faster than market, and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue.\nAnd with that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our third quarter results and guidance.\nGlenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning everyone. Let me start by highlighting our continued strong performance in both revenue and adjusted net income in the third quarter. As Juan Ram\u00f3n mentioned, we delivered operational revenue growth of 12%, driven by the performance of our dermatology portfolio, new products and the addition of Abaxis' diagnostics portfolio.\nOur organic operational revenue growth for the third quarter was 9%, which excludes Abaxis. Operational adjusted net income growth was 32%. We are confident in delivering our improved financial guidance for 2018 where we are narrowing our revenue guidance at the high end of the range and increasing our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. While I will not provide formal guidance on 2019 until early next year, I believe our diverse portfolio, core capabilities and investment strategy will enable us to continue delivering on our value proposition of organically growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue.\nNow, let's talk about the drivers of our Q3 performance, which continued the momentum from the first half of the year. Reported revenue growth was 10% in the third quarter, which includes a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. Currency depreciation in Brazil was the largest driver of the unfavourability in the quarter. We generated 12% operational revenue growth balanced across our segments with the U.S. growing 11% and International growing 12% operationally. Looking at growth by species, Companion Animal grew 19% operationally and Livestock grew 6% operationally.\nIncluded in our operational revenue growth of 12% is 3% from Abaxis. Of the 9% organic operational revenue growth, price contributed 4% and volume contributed 5%. New products drove 2% line, with the remaining 3% driven by our key dermatology portfolio.\nPrice contributions of 4% in the quarter are higher than usual and relate to the timing of promotional activities in the third quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. Price contributed 2% over the first nine months of the year, which is more consistent with our expectations.\nAdjusted net income grew 32% operationally, driven by revenue growth, gross margin improvements and a lower effective tax rate. As I already mentioned, our key dermatology portfolio comprised of Apoquel and Cytopoint continued to be a significant driver of growth this quarter with sales of $172 million, a 39% increase over the prior year.\nIn the first nine months of the year, we have recognized revenue of $436 million in our key dermatology portfolio with both Apoquel and Cytopoint contributing to the continued success. Consistent with our expectations for these products, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis, so we do anticipate moderated performance in Q4, particularly in the U.S. We continue to expect sales for this portfolio to exceed $500 million in 2018, and as Juan Ram\u00f3n discussed, we see continued growth as we move into 2019.\nNew products also continued to drive growth for Zoetis with Simparica as the primary driver. Simparica generated $43 million of sales this quarter, representing operational growth of 80% over the same period last year. We expect some moderation in Q4 as we move out of the flea and tick season in the U.S. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of this product in the highly competitive parasiticide market, and we expect continued growth both domestically and internationally.\nNow before moving into the segment results, I would like to provide more visibility into the Abaxis numbers. Included in Zoetis' reported results this quarter are sales of $42 million from legacy Abaxis products since our July 31 acquisition. These sales represent two months of sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and one month of sales for all other international markets based on our international reporting calendar. Please note that Q3 revenue for Abaxis also includes a destocking of wholesaler inventories that we expect to continue in Q4 as we normalize wholesaler inventories consistent with Zoetis levels.\nWith the acquisition of Abaxis, we are adding a new major product category in our financial statements and our 10-Q filings within the revenue by major product category section called Animal Health Diagnostics. This product category will include the animal health products acquired from Abaxis as well as our legacy diagnostics products previously classified within other non-pharmaceuticals. The human health diagnostic products acquired from Abaxis will be classified within a new category called Contract Manufacturing & Human Health Diagnostics.\nNow let's discuss Zoetis' segment revenues for Q3. Beginning with the U.S., revenue grew 11% in the third quarter, including Abaxis which contributed 4%. Including the impact of Abaxis, Companion Animal grew 20% while Livestock grew 1%. Companion Animal sales in the quarter were driven by our key dermatology portfolio, new products, as well as the addition of Abaxis. Certain in-line product decline due to competitive pressure partially offset these increases. Excluding the impact of Abaxis, Companion Animal growth was 12%.\nU.S. dermatology sales were $121 million for the quarter with both Apoquel and Cytopoint exhibiting significant growth over the same quarter in the prior year. Simparica also had another positive quarter with U.S. sales in the quarter growing 53% over the same period last year. Revenue growth was due to increased in-clinic penetration and market share and returns on our direct-to-consumer investments. Partially offsetting growth in our Companion Animal business were declines in Revolution and Clavamox due to competition.\nThe U.S. Livestock business continued with strong growth in poultry and swine in the third quarter, partially offset by a decline in cattle. In poultry, the Zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics and medicated feed additives continues to be the primary driver of growth. Favorable market conditions in the layer market also contributed to growth in vaccines. Swine also had consistent growth in the third quarter, primarily in EXCEDE related to promotional effort. We also continued to increase market share of Fostera Gold PCV MH which launched in the first quarter this year.\nIn the cattle business, we saw challenges in both the beef and dairy segments related to competition and unfavorable market dynamics. We do expect the cattle market to recover sometime in 2019, however, the impact of weather, herd movements and producer profitability all play a role in the timing.\nOverall, the U.S. continues to be a significant growth driver for Zoetis, particularly due to our product diversity and strategic investments, despite some temporary unfavorable market conditions in the cattle business.\nTurning now to our International segment, revenue grew 12% operationally in the third quarter with operational growth in Companion Animal of 18% and operational growth in Livestock of 10%. Companion Animal product growth was largely driven by our key dermatology products Apoquel and Cytopoint, new products such as Simparica and Stronghold Plus, increased medicalization rates in key international markets and the addition of Abaxis. Livestock products benefited from favorable market conditions, including increasing demand for animal protein, new products and the impact of our field force.\nOur fish business also performed very well this quarter, with operational growth of 21%. This strong growth was driven by increased market share of our pancreatic disease or PD vaccine as well as customer adoption of our SRS vaccine in Chile.\nHighlighting some key markets for the quarter, in Brazil sales grew 31% operationally with Companion Animal growing 48% and Livestock growing 26%. Companion Animal revenue in Brazil benefited from strong growth in parasiticides with Simparic as the primary driver and a positive return on the direct to consumer investment. Livestock benefited from the recovery of sales that were delayed at the end of Q2 due to the national truck drivers' strike. Strong underlying demand, favorable export conditions and local promotional activities also contributed to growth in the quarter.\nIn the UK, sales grew 30% operationally. Both Companion Animal and Livestock contributed to this performance, with new products primarily driving growth on the Companion Animal side and fish driving increases in Livestock. Key dermatology products and new parasiticides both performed well in the quarter, resulting from field force focus and marketing promotions, which increased pet owner awareness of the brand. In fish, vaccines were the primary driver of growth, due to increased market share in our PD vaccine as well as our multivalent vaccine, ALPHA JECT micro 6.\nMoving on to China, we had another great quarter, growing revenue 15% operationally, largely due to the timing of distributor purchases of our swine product. Companion Animal products also continued demonstrating growth, primarily in parasiticides and vaccines.\nAustralia grew 9% operationally, primarily driven by Companion Animal and sheep. In Companion Animal, Simparica and Apoquel increased sales due to the return on our direct-to-consumer investments, as well as strength of our in-line portfolio and promotional efforts in the quarter. Sheep products also benefited from continued strength in local market conditions.\nOther emerging markets, particularly Vietnam, Argentina, Turkey and India, performed well. Vietnam performed well on Livestock, particularly in swine, due to increased market prices for pork. Argentina and Turkey had broad-based growth across Companion Animal and Livestock, while growth in India was largely due to strength in poultry.\nSummarizing International performance, we saw new products, favorable market conditions and diversity across our portfolio all contributing to another very strong quarter for our International segment.\nNow, moving on to the rest of the P&L, I want to cover a few key line items and then discuss guidance for 2018. Adjusted gross margin of 68.7% increased approximately 80 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis. This improvement reflects favorable pricing and the benefit of continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network, which were partially offset by the impact of Abaxis. Total adjusted operating expenses including Abaxis grew 11% operationally versus the same period last year.\nAdjusted SG&A operational growth was 10%, primarily due to the addition of Abaxis and increased compensation-related costs. Adjusted R&D operational growth of 13% reflects increased investments in areas such as monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain and other pipeline programs, as well as Abaxis.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly lower than the rate from the comparable 2017 period due to the favorable impact of U.S. tax reform and discrete items recognized during the quarter. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 32% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth, improvements in gross margin, and a lower effective tax rate. These increases are partially diluted by the impact of Abaxis, which we expect to become mildly accretive in 2019 on an adjusted basis. As previously communicated, we are creating strong operating leverage, while investing in strategic areas of future growth for Zoetis including acquisitions such as Abaxis. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 34% operationally in the quarter versus the same period in 2017.\nNow, moving to guidance for the full year 2018, our consistent revenue growth, gross margin improvement and returns on strategic investments are allowing us to narrow our revenue guidance towards the high end of the range and raise and narrow our outlook on adjusted diluted EPS. Starting with revenue, we are narrowing the range of our revenue guidance and expect to deliver between $5.75 billion and $5.8 billion in revenue, representing operational revenue growth of 8% to 9%. Excluding Abaxis' partial-year revenue which consists of five months of domestic activity and four months of International, the organic operational revenue growth range is 6% to 7%. Consistent with what I communicated the last quarter, our full year guidance includes headwinds in Q4 that I want to remind you of as you think about the remainder of the year.\nOur business in Q4 2017 was very strong, so the growth off this higher base will moderate. U.S. livestock is one area where we experienced an exceptionally strong Q4. In addition, the fourth quarter of this year will also include four fewer international calendar days compared to last year, resulting from the change in our accounting calendar implemented this year. Please note that from an EPS growth perspective, Q4 will be impacted by the timing of cost of sales which were higher in the first half of 2017 when compared to the second half of 2017 as well as the timing of operating expenses.\nFor SG&A and R&D, we're narrowing guidance towards the high end of both ranges, consistent with our revenue performance and to support investments for future growth. Our guidance for the adjusted effective tax rate has been lowered to approximately 19% from our previous guidance of approximately 20%. This is primarily due to the impact of favorable discrete non-recurring items resulting from the implementation of U.S. tax reform. We continue to anticipate our effective tax rate going forward to be higher due to certain provisions of U.S. tax reform which will go into effect in 2019.\nFor adjusted diluted EPS, we are raising and narrowing the guidance and now expect to deliver between $3.08 and $3.13. Our range for reported diluted EPS of $2.81 to $2.90 includes preliminary estimates for certain significant items and purchase accounting for the Abaxis acquisition as well as gaining on the sale of our plant health business, which was completed in our international Q4 period.\nFinally, we repurchased nearly $550 million of Zoetis shares in the first nine months of the year. We have approximately $450 million remaining under the current multiyear share repurchase plan and remain committed to our capital allocation priorities of internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the shares repurchased through the end of Q3.\nNow, to summarize before we move to Q&A, we have delivered consistent operational top and bottom line growth in the first nine months of the year, with contributions across all core species, therapeutic areas and geographies. We are narrowing our range of revenue guidance to the high end of the range and increasing and narrowing our guidance for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS. Our diversity, strategic internal and external investments, and ability to innovate, will continue to provide a platform for revenue growth that is in line with or faster than the market.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nWe'll take our first question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I might try to jam three questions into one. So the first, on the big three therapeutics, I have that up over 40% year-over-year. At a high level, how should we think about the rate of growth from these three blockbusters in 2019 and 2020? I think you said very healthy but maybe at a diminished rate. So, anything more that you can provide there.\nSecond would be just early feedback from the Abaxis acquisition. How should we think about sales force retention? And then have you kicked off any bundling in terms of price?\nAnd lastly, Glenn, just the price of 4% in the quarter, I just want to be clear there, we should think of that more as onetime due to the year ago comp? Thanks, guys.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you, Jon. Glenn will answer the first question. I will cover the Abaxis question and then Glenn also will provide the comments on the 4% price increase in the quarter.\nGlenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.\nSo, Jon, when you look at the big three, and I assume you're mentioning Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica, we've had very strong growth in the quarter and year-to-date. As we look forward into 2019 and 2020, we do still see opportunities for growth for all those products. So, particularly, with our dermatology portfolio we see continued growth in U.S. albeit at a slower rate as we have significant penetration in terms of patient share there. We're up to 63% already. We do see further opportunity continue to grow the market there as well. We should also see a very strong opportunity internationally where the penetration isn't quite at that level yet, so we do see continued growth internationally in Apoquel and Cytopoint as well.\nIn Simparica we continue to see very strong performance, continued adoption, and we think that growth will continue into the 2019 and 2020 as well, but again probably at a slower rate and also the impact of competition and new products that may come into that category may also impact growth going forward.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nOkay. Thank you, Glenn. In terms of the Abaxis integration, well, the retention of the field force I think is not \u2013 I can describe as 100% retention. And not only it's about retention, it's about the feedback that we are getting from the field force from Abaxis, which is extremely positive. They are expressing the excitement of the opportunity now to be supported by a larger company, by much more presence in our field. And the combination of the two portfolios is something that can create significant opportunities.\nI think it's too early to discuss about bundling. Definitely we see the opportunity of combining the diagnostic portfolio of Abaxis, the diagnostic portfolio of Zoetis, and also the rest of the portfolio of medicines, and it's something that it's a work in progress. We see that diagnostic medicines, vaccines, are very much integrated in the clinics, so we expect that this will present a significant opportunity in the future.\nGlenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.\nAnd, Jon, in terms of the price for the quarter, so like you say, the 4% is more of a onetime impact for the quarter. The year-to-date number of 2% is much more in line with what we typically expect to be able to generate from price.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nAnd we'll take the next question from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAlex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking the question and congratulations on all the progress. First, just a follow-up on atopic dermatitis, I think one of your competitors reported data with their IL-31 recently. I'm referring to Kindred. Just wondering if you had any thoughts there whether it's on that product or just, in general how you see the competitive landscape evolving here. I'm sure your success hasn't gone unnoticed.\nSecond, could you please break out Apoquel, Cytopoint, and Simparica by U.S. and ex-U.S.? And finally, if I may, Juan Ram\u00f3n, I missed your comments about 2019 expectations for livestock species. Could you please clarify that? And any additional color would be appreciated. Thank you.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you, Alex. Good morning. So, let me discuss about the potential competition of our dermatology portfolio. Definitely this is something that we already communicated in previous calls that over time we expect competitors coming into this attractive market. It's a market that has been basically created by Zoetis. In the same way that many years ago, we also created the pain market for dogs, and even after many years and many new entrants, still Rimadyl remains the leading brand in terms of pain for dogs.\nSo, we are expecting competition but we also expect that we have a very strong position with the combination of Apoquel and Cytopoint and products that has been responding extremely well to the needs of veterinarians and also the needs of dogs, and we are very confident that these products will continue growing. And new competition also will expand the market and we also benefit of this market expansion from a leadership position.\nGlenn will discuss about the breakdown between dermatology products, Simparica, U.S., International and also I will be covering the expectations for Livestock in 2019.\nGlenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.\nSo, just to break out the numbers. So, for derm for Q3, we had total sales of $172 million. $121 million of that came from the U.S., with $51 coming from International. Breaking out Apoquel, we had total sales of $134 million, the U.S. at $88 million, International at $45 million. You can then do the math for Cytopoint, the difference between the two. For Simparica, we had total sales of $43 million in the quarter, with the U.S. at $26 million and International at $17 million.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nSo, the comments I provided for 2019 in terms of livestock were related to the market and not specific to our projection for 2019 Livestock Zoetis. What I said is that the market expect that poultry will be growing faster than this 5% which is expected growth for the overall animal health industry. Swine will be in line with the market and cattle will be much more modest growth. And this is something that, at this point, we are not yet providing the specifics of our growth in 2019, but we expect that we'll be more or less in line with the market expectations.\nNext question?\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, my first question here was just back onto the cattle here. Can you just give more specifics as to what is going to actually drive the recovery in cattle in 2019? And then the second question is just on opportunities for growth and operating margin expansion in 2019 and beyond, if you still see anything beyond what you've already said and if so, where these could come from. Thank you.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you, Louise. We expect, as I said, in 2019 modest growth in cattle for the animal health industry. We see that prices for dairy are improving. We expect that this improve to be seen in the second half of 2018. It's taking longer. But now there are indications that these prices are recovering in the U.S. and also recovering in International market. So, we are more optimistic about dairy in 2019. In 2019, we also expect small growth, very little growth in terms of number of heads in the beef section of cattle. And combining all these elements, we expect some recovery of cattle in 2019. But as I said, cattle is expected to grow at modest growth.\nGlenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.\nAnd, Louse, in terms of margin expansion, first I'll just continue to say that we're really not managing to any particular margin, but really we are managing for long-term cash flow growth and value. But when you look forward in terms of 2019 and 2020, we've previously articulated that we expect to get gross margin expansion of about 200 basis points by 2020 with 2017 being the starting point for that. So, our cost of goods as a percent of sales at that point was about 33%. We've guided 2018 to be approximately 32%, and we do expect continued improvement in both 2019 and 2020.\nAs we move forward, we also do expect to be able to get some leverage from operating expenses. But in 2019, in particular, as we continue to integrate Abaxis and build to make sure that we're supporting that business, that expansion may not be as strong as it may be moving forward in 2020 and beyond. But between the combination of the gross margin expansion and being able to grow expenses at a slower rate than revenue, we do expect to be able to get margin expansion moving forward.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you, Glenn. Next question, please.\nOperator\nOur next question's from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\nKevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess could we start off with capital allocation? You guys have \u2013 now that you're done with the Abaxis acquisition, wondering what else we should be thinking about in terms of how you plan to use the capital aside from the share repurchases. And then can you also comment on the pipeline, Juan Ram\u00f3n? Appreciate the comments on Simparica Trio and when you expect it. What about Europe? Are we going to see it approved in Europe before the U.S.? And then congrats on winning the Deming Cup for Operational Excellence Thanks.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you, Kevin. In terms of our capital allocation, we are not changing the previous capital allocation communication. So, definitely, we see and we continue seeing opportunities in terms of investing internally. We are increasing our allocation to R&D. We communicated that also we are expanding and increasing the capabilities in manufacturing. And we see opportunities in commercial, and in 2018, 2019, the opportunities there definitely will be in diagnostics and will be an expansion of our presence in International markets. So, we'll continue investing internally. And the result of this investment has been extremely positive and we'll continue making sure that we have the resources to generate long-term growth.\nIn terms of BD, the second priority in terms of capital allocation, we just completed the acquisition of Abaxis. We also had some other minor acquisitions, Smartbow, that it also a company that will be providing sensors and also the opportunity for more data analytics, digital in the dairy farms. And it's an area that we are also very interested ensuring that we are developing the internal capabilities in terms of digital data analytics there to provide this value to our customers. And we'll continue with returning the excess capital to our shareholders. It will be through dividends. It will be through buying shares back. Nothing has changed, and definitely we still see opportunities of, as I said, continue investing internally, identifying external opportunities and returning this excess capital.\nIn terms of the pipeline, well, Simparica Trio has been filed in both the U.S. and also Europe. When this will be coming to the market, it's to be seen because it's depending on the regulators. But definitely, we expect that Simparica Trio will be in the market sometime in 2020. Who will be first, it's to be seen.\nThere are some other products that also we'll see even earlier than 2019. For example, we are also expecting that in the U.S. we'll have lifecycle innovation with Revolution Plus and combining Revolution Plus active ingredient with a combination of other agents that we will expand the protection not only to fleas and ticks but making it stronger for ticks. And this is something that we expect this Revolution Plus coming into the market in 2019. And we'll continue also bringing in some other products in 2019 in the U.S. and also international markets, especially lifecycle innovation.\nI also mentioned that we are expecting the approval of Apoquel in China. Again, it's subject to regulatory approvals, but it can be sometime in 2019 and this will also help us to continue growing Apoquel or the dermatologico for Zoetis. And China now is one of our top markets for companion animal within Zoetis. So, it's probably a good opportunity that we see the introduction of Apoquel in this market.\nNext question?\nOperator\nOur next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright - Credit Suisse\nGreat. Thanks. A couple of questions here, you mentioned some de-stocking as it relates to Abaxis, but can you provide any sort of metrics on the integration process there and traction you're seeing in terms of in-customer instrument placement trends or consumables growth, and as we think about modeling out the diagnostics segment that you'll be breaking out, should we consider that a double-digit grower when studying your own diagnostics portfolio?\nAnd then the second part of my question is how you think about a potentially kind of evolving supply chain in pet medications and do you think that it is rapidly evolving or evolving to some extent that consumers have more choice and veterinarians have more choice? And what do you think about broader implications, newer concepts such as Vets First Choice and your ability to realize price thereon? Thanks.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nOkay. Thank you, Erin. So, in terms of Abaxis performance (42:06) I think it's \u2013 well, the integration of the closing of Abaxis has been at the mid of this quarter. I think it's probably a little bit too early to provide the full details of the different elements of the diagnostics implementation in the clinics. This is something that we'll discuss what will be the level of information that we'll be providing in the future. And maybe we can have this discussion in the fourth quarter when we have the full quarter already reporting and having all the elements that are under control by Zoetis.\nGlenn will be talking about the de-stocking question that you raised.\nGlenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.\nYes. So, just to give a little more color into the Abaxis numbers. So, we referenced that we had $42 million of sales in Q3. Just a reminder, that includes two months of U.S. and one month International, so it's a partial quarter. Of that $42 million is also $7 million related to human health diagnostics, so the animal health diagnostics piece of that $42 million was $35 million.\nTo get to your question on growth for the quarter a little bit, Erin, if you take some of the pro forma information and then put that together with what I just referenced in terms of the $35 million, again it's not 100% audited or accurate because we're piecing together different pieces of information. But you would get to mid-single digit growth for the quarter for the legacy Abaxis business. Now, that does also include the de-stocking that I referenced which we do expect to continue into Q4. But if you were to adjust for that de-stocking, we get to double-digit growth in the Abaxis portfolio which we do expect to continue moving forward at double-digit growth rate.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nAnd Erin, what we expect from animal health diagnostics growth trend long-term is that we'll be growing faster than the animal health core business medicines, and I think it has been, in the past, growing at 7%, 8%. We also expect that in the future we'll be growing higher than the 5%. And where we see significant opportunities for growth is in International markets. And we are now expanding our presence and we are convinced that we have a significant opportunity to penetrate in this market.\nYou also asked about the U.S., changes in the distribution retail channel, talking about Vets First Choice or internet pharmacy (44:42), well, definitely, it's a lot of changes in this segment, companion animal in the U.S. We see some of these changes also having the positive impact of expanding the market, having much more access there for pet owners, at the same time the opportunity also to increase compliance. But at the same time, we are convinced that veterinarians will remain at the center of healthcare decision especially in areas that will require prescription and intervention of veterinarians with injectables or vaccination or acute treatment in the Companion Animal. And we'll continue supporting the veterinarians really to deliver value to our pet owners.\nNext question?\nOperator\nOur next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nThanks. Congrats on the quarter, guys. I have a couple questions I'm going to roll into one but it's going to be focused on some of the innovation of the portfolio. You talked about the additional indications for Cytopoint, the allergic dermatitis. Can you give any sense of how much that expands the potential for that product, near-term in both as we go into 2019 and 2020?\nAnd then regarding some of the other innovation, the lifecycle extensions in Draxxin and Vanguard, some of the work you mentioned, the focus on the pain monoclonal antibody. Just to get a sense of how big of a contributor this could be in 2019, 2020 as some of these new products come in. And then along that line, one last one is we saw some news reports that the USDA was potentially granting you a license for an African swine fever vaccine that's in an open comment period. Can you talk about the potential for that market? Obviously, there's a lot of talk in the swine markets about the disease outbreaks there, so, any sense of timing or potential impact? Thanks.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you, Mike. So, let me cover the question on additional label indications for Cytopoint. So, in allergies there are four main reasons for this condition. So, one is related to fleas, the other one is food, and the third one is the environment. Anything which is not in these three areas is described as atopic. Now, Cytopoint also have the indication of allergy, not only atopic indication, and this will help us really to promote what all the indications of Cytopoint. We are not expecting significant revenues because of that, but definitely it's an area that in our opinion veterinarians has been using Cytopoint based on their own understanding of the needs. But the fact that we'll be now promoting a broader label, we will always help, but we don't expect a significant incremental revenue. We expect that the market in the U.S. still has a potential for expansion and also we expect that our patient share also can increase with the right interactions with the veterinarians and the right communication with the pet owner. And this is applicable to the U.S. and also International.\nIn terms of pipeline contribution in the near-term \u2013 well in the near term, we discussed about near-term 2019, so the pipeline will be mainly related to lifecycle innovation. We'll always be introducing some new vaccines, new product, but we expect significant introduction of new products in 2020. And we'll have the opportunity to discuss in February the details of our guidance for 2019 and also how we see 2019 in terms of the different sources of growth, our current portfolio, new product introduction and also price.\nYou also asked about the African swine fever and the collaboration with the USDA. This is something that will take several years to see a vaccine in the market to protect pigs against the African swine fever. But definitely, it's an area that has significant impact and we have seen the impact now in China and also in some other markets. It's affecting the production of pork. But what I think is even more important that what is the short-term opportunity for developing a vaccine to protect pigs against the African swine fever is the confirmation that Zoetis is the banner of choice with the USDA and many other institutions when we need to bring new vaccines into the market. And this is, in my opinion, what is important at this moment in the collaboration that we are establishing between us and the USDA.\nNext question?\nOperator\nThe next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJon Kaufman - William Blair & Co. LLC\nHi. Good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for John Kreger. So, a question on the monoclonal antibody products, is there anything more you can tell us? What stage of the development process are they in and when do you expect them to come to market? Thank you.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nWell, I think it's too early to indicate when the product will be in the market. So, what I can tell you is that we are making a very good progress. So, we have several products for both dogs and cats. We are very optimistic about these products reaching the market. And as I said, I will provide to you more updates as we start the process of filing the dossier into the FDA and also the European agencies. And then when we have that information, then I will be providing more details of when we plan to have the product into the market.\nNext question?\nOperator\nThe next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nGreat. Thanks very much for the questions, just one coming back to some of the earlier comments on OpEx going forward and expense growth. You've obviously stepped up spend this year supporting the pipeline and the new launches, sounds like 2019 might be another year of investment with Abaxis. I guess my question is once we get beyond that spend, should we think about OpEx growth slowing back down to more inflation-type growth that we've seen historically for the company? Or are we in a sustained period here where we should think about OpEx growth kind of above inflation, maybe closer to topline just given the variety of new products that you seem to have targeted for the next few years?\nMy second question was just on the Simparica Trio and maybe just taking a step back. Maybe just put in context how much larger of an opportunity do you see for that product relative to Simparica today as we just think about that 2020 and beyond opportunity. Thank you.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you, Chris. Well, I would probably share my general comments about OpEx, and then also Glenn will provide more details. So, we have seen 2018, maybe also 2019 as a years in where we are building some additional capabilities in our commercial infrastructure, has been also two years where we see additional opportunities to invest in R&D, and this is driving that higher growth in terms of operating expenses than in previous years.\nIn the long-term, I think we'll remain in line with previous communications that operating expenses will be growing in line with inflation. But it's also true that we have seen significant changes in our business, the inclusion or addition of Abaxis. We also included some other areas where we need some additional capabilities. And there are now new opportunities that we have seen also in digital and also in terms of data analytics. All these it's, well, creating the need of further investment but as I said, it's something that we see as temporary, and then over time, moving into the long-term growth in line with inflation.\nGlenn, do you want to add some additional comments here?\nGlenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.\nYeah. The only thing I'd add particularly for 2019 as you look at it, I mean, one of the key drivers of the expense growth for 2019 will be the fact that we'll have a full 12 months of the Abaxis portfolio and expenses supporting that portfolio in 2019 versus only a partial year this year. And we'll also still be in the build phase for some of the diagnostics field force that we're building in both the U.S. and International.\nAs Juan Ram\u00f3n said, once we move forward into 2020, we would expect particularly the G&A line to then trend much more in line with inflation, and selling in particular, we would expect expenses to be slower than revenue growth from a selling perspective as well. R&D, we'll continue to look at the opportunity and to the extent that there are opportunities to drive future short-, medium- and long-term growth, we'll make the right investments from an R&D perspective.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nSo, in terms of Simparica Trio and the incremental opportunity compared to Simparica, we are very pleased with the performance of Simparica. So, we are now on the nine month close to $150 million, $144 million (sic) [$125 million]. But still we are significantly underrepresented in the oral parasiticide market and where NexGard or Bravecto are generating much more significant sales. And one of the reasons were that we were several years behind competitors in terms of introducing these products. We are confident that with the Simparica Trio we'll be bringing a product that would be highly competitive and also we'll have the opportunity to capture part of the revenues which are today on internal parasiticides and also heartworm provided by other products.\nSo, the opportunity in Simparica Trio, it's to capture higher share in terms of the overall market of oral parasiticides and expanding to internal parasiticides. So, we'll provide in the future when we have probably closer to the launch what can be the expectations of Simparica Trio.\nNext question?\nOperator\nThe next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nKathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC\nThank you. Good morning. Just two quick questions on Companion Animal. First is, in the past you've estimated the U.S. market penetration of your derm products is around 59%. Is that good or has that increased? And the second question is also on companion animals, derm and Simparica trends have been very strong, but how should we be thinking about the underlying, the base business? Is that flattish or growing slightly going forward? Thank you.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nSo, thank you, Kathy. So, you're correct, so the 59% share, it was related to patient share for Apoquel, Cytopoint. This was in previous quarters. Now we have increased to 63% in the U.S., and we are significantly lower in International markets. And again, so, International markets is where we see the opportunity of first expanding the dermatology market and also increasing our penetration with the market share.\nYou also asked about the base business excluding I guess Apoquel, Cytopoint, Simparica, I guess this is the question. Maybe, Glenn, you can answer that.\nGlenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.\nYes. So, when you look at the base business in the U.S., if you exclude the derm products, volume growth is declining. That is partially offset by some positive increase in price. But overall, volume growth is declining, and that is driven by some competitive pressures that we're seeing on some of our more established products such as Revolution and Clavamox as they face competition, A, from other new products but also from generic competition. But the impact that we're seeing there is very much in line with what we expect from a long-term perspective once we lose exclusivity in terms of the 20% to 40% over an extended period of time.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nThe next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nYes, thanks very much, and congrats on the performance. I have a couple questions related to the Trio opportunity. The first is have you filed all of the components of the application with the FDA?\nSecond, I believe that, Juan Ram\u00f3n, you said 2020, which I believe is a delay from the prior comments of second half of 2019 approval and launch. Could you comment on that? And third, do you have 100% heartworm protection in the product? Thank you.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you, Dave. Let me confirm that Simparica Trio has been filed with all the different sections in the FDA. And I thought that in previous communications we were saying that we are expecting the Simparica Trio to be in the market in 2020, and we can maybe check if there was any confusion here, but I want to confirm that we expect this product in 2020. And let me \u2013 I think we are very confident that the product, Simparica Trio, will have full protection for heartworm. But let me confirm with our scientists what will be the level of protection in terms of percentage. But we are very confident that the efficacy of the product for internal and external will be excellent. So, this is one of the reasons why we are confident that the product will have a significant opportunity once it's launched into the U.S. and also in International markets. Let me say that in International markets, maybe the opportunity is lower than the U.S. because heartworm outside of the U.S. is less prevalent. So, the biggest opportunity for Simparica Trio will be in the U.S.\nNext question?\nOperator\nAnd it does appear we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix for closing comments.\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.\nThank you for your attention. We are very pleased with the results of the third quarter, and as I said, extremely confident in our guidance for total year 2018 that has been growing over time, and now we have provided an increase in terms of adjusted net income for the total year . Thank you for your attention.\nOperator\nAnd this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.\n\n",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Boyer\nGood morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 2019 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q1 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter, are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes its non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance the understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found on IHS Markit\u2019s filings with SEC and the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions.\nWith that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance Uggla. Lance?\nLance Uggla\nThank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 earnings call. We are pleased with our Q1 results as we continue to perform within expectations. We are making excellent progress on the integration of Ipreo and our post merger strategic initiatives.\nKey financial highlights of the quarter are: revenue of $1.046 million, up 5% on an organic basis and 12% overall; solid growth in transportation, financial services and resources; adjusted EBITDA of $408 million and margin of 39% with continued strong expansion; finally, adjusted EPS of $0.60, up 13% over the prior year.\nLet me now provide some segment highlights. Transportation continued to produce solid results with organic revenue growth of 8% in the quarter in line with our high single-digit guidance. We continue to benefit from our diversification across the auto sector\u2019s entire value chain. The strongest growth drivers in the quarter included our auto forecasting, Carfax Used Card Listing and automotiveMastermind businesses. Financial services reported strong results with 6% organic growth with strength across our information and solutions businesses in a diversified fashion. In particular, a strong quarter for pricing, managed loan services, reg in compliance and in our software businesses, analytics and EDM performed well. Ipreo results had strong growth in corporate services and private capital markets offset somewhat by lower equity issuance. We have since seen a pickup in deal flow.\nCMS organic revenue was minus 3% as our TMT business was impacted by the uncertainty of a larger contract renewal. Our product design in ECR businesses performed as expected. We expect CMS organic growth to be in the low single-digits for the year. In resources, we delivered our strongest quarter since 2015 with 6% organic growth and we remain confident in our organic revenue growth outlook for 2019. Our view supported by industry trends, the growth of our trailing 12-month annual contract value, strong non-recurring revenue pipeline and continued investment in innovation. CERAWeek, our global energy conference had record attendance, up 20% year-over-year with over 5,000 attendees. This year, CERAWeek was diversified across energy markets and also across our firm with strong plenary participation in mobility, technology and finance. The energy industry is in the early stages of increasing its investment in advanced technologies to gain greater insights and to increase efficiency. IHS Markit is well positioned to partner with industry to help in these efforts. Overall, we were pleased with another solid quarter of execution and financial results.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Hyatt\nThank you, Lance. As Lance discussed, our Q1 results were in line with our expectations and included revenue of $1.046 billion, organic growth of 5% and total revenue growth of 12%, net income of $109 million and GAAP EPS of $0.27, adjusted EBITDA of $408 million, an increase of 14% with margin of 39.0% and adjusted EPS of $0.60, an increase of $0.07 or 13%. Relative to revenue, our Q1 organic revenue growth of 5% included stable recurring organic growth of 5% and non-recurring organic growth of 8%.\nLooking at segment performance, transportation organic revenue growth was 8%. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 9% recurring and 4% non-recurring. Resources organic revenue growth was 6%. Organic growth was comprised of 5% recurring and 16% non-recurring. Recurring and total organic growth benefited by 1% each point from favorable timing associated with software sales impacted by the new revenue recognition accounting standard. Our Q1 organic ACV increased $3 million on a trailing 12-month organic ACV increased $26 million to $738 million, which was up 4% versus prior year. We continued to trend at an ACV level supportive of our 2019 revenue expectation. CMS organic revenue declined 3%. Organic revenue was negatively impacted by uncertainty of a contract renewal in our TMT business.\nRecurring organic was flat and non-recurring organic declined 20% in part due to $2 million from Boiler Code. We expect approximately $10 million of organic revenue growth in second half of the year from the Boiler Code. We now expect CMS organic growth in the low single-digits excluding Boiler Code. Financial services total revenue growth was 28% including organic revenue growth of 6%, acquisitive growth of 24% and negative 1% FX. Recurring organic growth was 4%, non-recurring organic increased $7 million or 37%. Information organic revenue increased 5%, led by strength in our pricing and reference data and valuation services business.\nDerivative processing volumes were strong while loan market volumes were soft resulting a net processing organic decline of 3%. Solutions organic revenue increased 12%. Growth was led by loan services business and analytics and EDM software. Our Ipreo business delivered $76 million of revenue and is on track to deliver throughout full year adjusted EBITDA target of $115 million, but we expect revenue at the lower end of our $350 million to $370 million guidance range.\nTurning now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was $408 million, up $49 million or 14% versus prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.0%, up 80 basis points normalized for Ipreo and FX and up 40 basis points on a reported basis. Regarding segment profitability, transportation\u2019s adjusted EBITDA was $114 million with a margin of 39.7%, down 100 basis points due to lower margin recall revenue and higher marketing spend in our CARFAX business to support forward product initiatives. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $93 million with the margin of 43.0%, up 160 basis points. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $29 million with the margin of 22.2%, down 90 basis points. Financial services delivered strong margin with adjusted EBITDA of $183 million, margin of 44.8%, up 290 basis points normalized for Ipreo and down 70 basis points on a reported basis. Adjusted EPS was $0.60 per diluted share, a $0.07 or 13% improvement. Our GAAP tax rate was minus 1% and our adjusted tax rate was 18%. Q1 free cash flow was $125 million. As expected, Q1 cash was seasonally low due to bonus payments. Our trailing 12 months free cash flow was $1.04 billion and represented a conversion rate of 65%.\nTurning to the balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was $5.6 billion, which was down $83 million from prior year end and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 3.4x on a bank covenant basis. Our in-quarter bank covenant leverage was impacted by lapping a prior year tax benefit from tax reform. We continue to track to our target to de-lever below 3x in Q3. Finally, we closed the quarter with $133 million of cash and our year end undrawn revolver balance was approximately $700 million. Our Q1 weighted average diluted share count was 408 million shares. In terms of guidance, we are reaffirming our prior guidance. Full year guidance provides for revenue of $4.425 billion to $4.5 billion with organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, including Ipreo 4-month stub period organic contribution. Including Ipreo for 12 months would increase total organic growth to 6% to 7%. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.75 billion to $1.78 billion, including adjusted EBITDA of $115 million from Ipreo, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points normalized per FX and excluding Ipreo and 80 basis point margin expansion including Ipreo, adjusted EPS of $2.52 to $2.57, which represents adjusted EPS growth of 11% at guidance midpoint.\nFinally, we expect cash conversion in line with our mid-60s target or more than $1.1 billion of free cashflow. In terms of capital allocation, we are focused on de-levering to below 3x and resuming our share buyback. We expect to buyback $500 million of stock in the second half of the year.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance.\nLance Uggla\nThanks, Todd. I am pleased with our start to 2019 and believe we are well-positioned to deliver upon our financial commitments for the year. The teams continue to deliver strong diversified revenue growth and margin expansion, while making the right level of investment to be able to sustain strong long-term financial returns for our shareholders. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Gary Bisbee of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nGary Bisbee\nHi, guys. Good morning. I guess the first question on Ipreo, can we get anymore color, do you think that government shutdown was really the issue and that it was equity underwriting and that normalizes or is there anything else that leads you to think revenue for the year comes in at the lower end of the prior target?\nLance Uggla\nNo, I think we definitely saw equity market slowdown. Government shutdown definitely played into that lower level of volumes. But since we have seen pickup and the other businesses are performing as planned and so we are confident with that 350 to 370 range and guided to the lower end of it. I think the other pieces is a bit \u2013 well, just answer that operator, then we will go to second one is that we have also reaffirmed. The team has done a great job on the cost side and we have reaffirmed the 115 target as well. Next question?\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.\nPeter Appert\nThank you. Good morning. So basically, Lance it seems like the operating results pretty broadly are in line with the guidance you played out, so is there anything you would call out in terms of things that are surprising you here for positive or negative that you are seeing in the current results?\nLance Uggla\nI think the and hopefully it came out loud and clear throughout the comments this morning is really I think a bit of a story of diversification in what I would say is the solid quarter of results that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s written on the instruction booklet. And I guess while I say diversified in that you have seen energy at the higher end of the range and that\u2019s come from negative growth because the top end of zero and 2, the top end of 2 to 4, we have now laid out 4 to 6 and mid single-digits and we feel really good about that. This was a solid 5% to 6% quarter and Todd called out the adjustment on the accounting rules that gave us a bit of a lift. But we feel really, really good about energy and then followed on with CERAWeek that had something like 5,500 people crossing right across mobility, finance, technology, big new sponsors Amazon, Microsoft, both they are sponsoring, Google Cloud sponsoring the conferences. And it just shows that we are right at the heart beat of data, data science, technology and the intersection into our industrial segments. So I think we \u2013 that bodes well. CERAWeek is a good barometer for the energy markets and I think that bodes well. So diversified in that in order for us to hit our guidance in the previous couple of years, we are always kind of pulled very fondly by automotive, no pun intended, but they kind of towed us up to the higher end. And energy was something we are covering and financial markets putting in a core set of results tending to the higher end at the end of last year. The other thing diversified within, so if you look at financial markets, even processing it\u2019s down, but the fact is as you have got derivatives doing well in loan processing, so it\u2019s a mix bag, things that have always been strong pricing, the private capital markets business, indices, all doing well and continued to do well. And then in automotive it was a bit of shift, Mastermind is doing well. The old core forecasting business is doing well and CARFAX continuing to storm ahead. That mix is slightly different than the digital marketing mix and recall that we are seeing last year. So I think when I talk to the team it was solid quarter and it\u2019s really nice to see that we are not relying on single parts of the company to carry it \u2013 carry our guidance. And \u2013 but the combination of the business is great. I think EBITDA performance across several of our businesses was stellar as well in terms of expanding margin. Next question?\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nManav Patnaik\nThank you. Good morning. My question was just on the energy business, so Todd just to confirm the \u2013 I guess the one point benefit this quarter, could you just talk about how we should think of that for the full year. And last just on your industry trends I was hoping if there was anything from CERAWeek specifically that you could talk to in terms of your positive outlook on energy?\nTodd Hyatt\nYes. But I think the one point we will watch through the year Manav, I mean I think it will be neutral by the time we get to year end. So when we look at the software products within energy they are generally pretty short-term licensing, so there is a little bit of variability in the timing with the new standard. 6% is certainly a point ahead of where we would have expected to be at this time, but we still feel very good about energy, solidly moving into the mid single-digits. And then I think on the non-recurring non-energy, consulting was good. And Lance talked about CERAWeek coming off of a pretty strong CERAWeek in March, so I think we are well positioned as we move forward through the rest of the year.\nLance Uggla\nAs I have said at the time of guidance Manav, I have said that across the firm we expected the rev/rec to be neutral to $10 million drag and then we will provide color as we go through the year. It creates a little bit of \u2013 I think the big thing it will create some in-quarter variability, but full year, we would expect it to generally be somewhat neutral.\nTodd Hyatt\nGood. So on the second part of your question I think there was two themes that kind of gave a interesting tone towards the upside as I would see it from IHS Markit perspective from CERAWeek. So I think one of the first themes, that\u2019s overriding the energy markets of course is climate. So that bodes well for a company that is well-positioned to consult across up mid and downstream energy activities. You have got the whole LNG markets are very interesting in terms of playing into climate change and the strong supply. And so of course, our consulting teams which then feed into our data products that bodes well. Also climate driving another component that intersects well with financial markets in that whole ESG and measurement of compliance by companies and the investment appetites of the investment markets and how those intersect and come together, that bodes really well for our energy market consultants, coupled with the financial markets, but also our recent acquisition of Ipreo plays well into that as well. I think what was interesting is the intersection is well at CERAWeek of technology and the fact that industry participants are definitely grappling with data, more data than they ever had before and how to manage it, how to share it, distribute it, exchange it between themselves and the vendors in a way that can provide market efficiencies, but also to help them to manage their businesses better and that bodes well for where we sit in the energy marketplace. So I think lots around climate plays in well to a data provider like ourselves as people are analyzing forward policy strategy investments. And then I would say the other one is geopolitics and just the state of the world in terms of whether it\u2019s Venezuela, sanctions in Iran, potential trade wars or settling of trade wars between U.S. and China and that bodes and plays into supply and demand scenarios that again we are a world leader in providing forecast into the upstream energy markets to help decisions around exploration and production. And so I felt that is a strong underlying theme. So yes, I think that all bodes well for where we positioned, I wouldn\u2019t change our guidance, but I think that it helps us reaffirm our guidance and look forward throughout the year and say this is going to be a solid performance for our teams with respect to energy. Next question?\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Your line is now open.\nJeff Meuler\nYes, thank you. Just wanted to push a little bit more in Ipreo, because you kind of took down the lower end of the range to risk adjust from the original guidance a couple of quarters ago and now just guiding towards the low end of the maintained range. So just in that context, I understand equity issuance with macro and the government shutdown weaker in Q1, but as you observed it\u2019s picked back up. So, I guess are you \u2013 is this just one quarter of lower equity origination moves the needle that much just anything that you could say to kind of reiterate confidence in Ipreo? Thanks.\nLance Uggla\nWell, I will start and then I will pass to Todd. So I guess I hope you have got used to 3 years of fairly conservative set of forward-looking guidance and we do want to set the right stage. And one thing about Ipreo, it\u2019s similar to derivatives. I hate the fact that any volume based businesses to me judge any particular quarter. What I care about is the fact that our assets whether they are the equity muni bond markets that are driving Ipreo results or whether they are loan processing or interest rate derivative processing or valuations of derivatives. Things that are volume related that really are outside of our control, so we have to guide with our best expectations of an annual marketplace. And since we acquired Ipreo, the markets have been a little bit quitter and there is no cost adjustment with respect to the equity piece which is very volume oriented. And so at this point we looked at our year, we have said we are going to have 5% to 6% organic growth here. We are reaffirming that today. We are into our second quarter. We feel hopefully you can feel a sense of confidence in our guidance. We are managing costs well. But I think through you folks, you can put in 350, you can put in 355 or 360, that\u2019s in that lower part of the range, wherever you want to put your models to and that gives us the solid outlook on the year and one that\u2019s appropriate to give you today. Todd, do you want to\u2026\nTodd Hyatt\nAnd I think that\u2019s right. I think you called out the Q1 revenue number that was certainly impacted by quitter markets. And I guess implicit in that, we wouldn\u2019t expect to catch all of that up as we move through the year. I mean I think there is \u2013 the markets are certainly much more constructive now. We expect to see a notable pickup in Q2 and see the business performing well for the rest of the year, but I have said at the time we gave guidance that to get to the higher end, things would fall into place well and that would signal some upside and we have protected very well at the 115 level in terms of the margin and so we feel very confident in that number.\nLance Uggla\nThere is a lot of chatter in the marketplace in terms of tech issuance, the likes of Uber and others all being touted and those all play well for a company like ours, but there is also trade wars and market dialogue that changes things day to day. What I can say if there is issuance there we will be doing it and that could bode very well in the second half or if you took the last 10 years and took the lowest volumes and modeled it out, it will probably put us at the bottom end of that range. And so I think we have given you a good guidance for today. Next question?\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nBill Warmington\nGood morning everyone.\nLance Uggla\nHi Bill.\nTodd Hyatt\nHi Bill.\nBill Warmington\nCould you talk about how the indices business is doing overall and comment on how China bond, the partnership that you did in October is doing and what do you think the opportunity is longer term in China?\nLance Uggla\nYes. Well, index business continues to perform well. I know in general if you look at some of the market chatter and where overall indices are \u2013 index volumes are amongst some of the bigger players you would think there would be more volatility. But actually our group, we are one of the world\u2019s \u2013 the two world leaders in fixed income bond indices and those volumes and levels have continued to perform well. So we are \u2013 we haven\u2019t experienced any significant change to our business there. In terms of our China bond index, I would say that the reception has been good. I don\u2019t have the exact numbers to provide you. It\u2019s something that you could follow-up with Eric on, but all I can say is that we are progressing, we have had great meetings, great reception and given that we are the only player that\u2019s working directly with the China bond as a partner. I think we have a competitive edge and that will bode well for the future. Next question?\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open.\nTim McHugh\nYes. I just want to follow-up maybe a little bit differently on the financial services, can you talk about is the growth rate of the \u2013 if we excluded the equity portion, is that consistent with what you thought and is that still kind of double-digit growth as you talked in the past?\nLance Uggla\nWe expect Ipreo to be double-digit growth, yes. Were you referring to Ipreo or our index business?\nTim McHugh\nYes, Ipreo.\nTodd Hyatt\nIpreo, yes.\nLance Uggla\nYes, okay. No, no, definitely our view is this Ipreo be a double-digit growth. And I think there is the organic growth in general was very, very strong in the quarter across the business.\nTodd Hyatt\niLevel was very strong. The corporate services were strong.\nLance Uggla\nPrivate capital markets strong. So, I don\u2019t think there is any \u2013 we don\u2019t have any cautionary flags whatsoever except that we can\u2019t measure the volume and it was lower than expected. Next question?\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Steinerman\nHi. Todd, I had always thought in the past that the resources ACV was a leading indicator of IHS Resources organic revenue growth. Just tell me if you agree with that and given that the resources organic revenue growth is now growing faster than ACV do you expect ACV to kind of bump up to the level where resources organic is?\nLance Uggla\nNo, I think the way you said it\u2019s the right way to think about it, Andrew. I mean, the ACV is the forward indicator. ACV growth on a trailing 12-month basis is 4%. The reported organic is ahead of that. I called out a percentage point of that was due to the new rev/rec standard. Within any quarter, I say there is potential of a point plus or minus just from contract renewal timing that can impact, but we have ACV right now, it\u2019s 4% we see that continuing to move up and that given I think with the context that Lance provides, it give us a high level of confidence that resources will certainly be in the mid single-digits this year.\nAndrew Steinerman\nThanks, Todd. Next question?\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nAshish Sabadra\nThanks. Yes, my question was on the transportation side, so continuously some good momentum there. I was just wondering if you can talk about traction for the Conquest marketing product within automotiveMastermind as well as the myCARFAX new product launch, how is that coming along and then just maybe quickly on the non-recurring side, any kind of visibility that you have on the recall activity there? Thanks.\nLance Uggla\nOkay. Maybe I will start and then I will pass to Todd. So the first thing is yes, we called out three areas of strong performance in the quarter, which slightly different than maybe previous quarters that was Mastermind and of course, the Conquest product launched in the quarter, so we have got a quarter of results and that was a strong participant. Second, it\u2019s too soon on CARFAX for Life, it was just launched in the new year, so you are really seeing that launch play into Q2, but the team worked right through 2018 to be ready for that early this year launch and they have got the product out and it\u2019s too early to give you any forecast except it\u2019s a well-developed product that will play well into the service lane and support future growth. Used car listings continues where smaller \u2013 the smaller participants, but with very high growth rates. And again I think quarter by quarter CARFAX and used car listings is one of their new innovative products over the last few years continues to grow and then just the underlying core automotive business with the whole, everybody wants to know impact of EVs, what\u2019s the future of ride-sharing programs, how does that affect componentary in cars. So the whole automotive forecasting becomes quite interesting and so another good performer. On the lumpier side recall, which is lower margin I think Todd called it out in some of the financials as well as digital marketing post Facebook, those which have been strong growers last year coming off slightly. So the mix of product is slightly different, but solid 8% organic growth and we are very pleased. Yes, recurring transport 9% and the non-recurring a bit lower and you see some of that variability in the non-recurring. The recurring feel very good about the continued performance at that level that very high single-digit level. There will be some variability in the non-recurring, recall certainly introduces a level of variability, but we don\u2019t see it being hugely profit impacting. So, I think we\u2019re \u2013 we continue to see very strong growth drivers throughout the Transportation segment and feel very good about the guidance we provided on that segment.\nLance Uggla\nGood. Thanks, Todd. Next question.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nHamzah Mazari\nGood morning. Thank you. My question is just around whether you think the portfolio can generate positive organic growth in a more significant slowdown. Just any color on cyclicality of the business? Thank you.\nLance Uggla\nYes. I think we\u2019ve said before that, I think that our 5% to 6% organic growth target takes us through cyclical change in the industries that we\u2019re in, because a lot of our products are kind of must-haves regardless of the sentiment in the markets they\u2019re in. So, for example, a large piece of the automotive market, 65% of it is used car listings, so that\u2019s not SAARs connected. In fact, if anything, it might be cyclical in a positive way, we don\u2019t call it out that way, but if you wanted to take the other side of that argument, you could. Forecasting, it\u2019s something that the OEMs need regardless of whether they\u2019re going to sell 1 million cars or 5 million cars, whatever the number is going to be, they still need our forecasting. Our emissions products, our regulatory and \u2013 are needed regardless in terms of measuring output regardless of the market environment.\nYou\u2019ve got Mastermind, which is helping dealers sell cars. Incentives usually go up. In the \u2013 in challenged markets, incentives go up, the whole need for data science around customer retention, customer conquest, service lane activity, those are all positives. So, automotive, I\u2019d say, in general, I believe it\u2019s well cushioned within its upper single-digit range in the cycles that we can see ahead of us in \u201819, \u201820, \u201821.\nEnergy, energy is interesting. Definitely exploration plays into our upstream, which is the largest piece of our Resources franchise. And \u2013 but explorations is a long \u2013 it\u2019s a long-term view, and the general view is to replace what\u2019s needed by the world economies as well as to fulfill the kind of base demand scenarios. There\u2019s still exploration required, and therefore, I think the markets got into this equilibrium state with oil in the $55 to $65 range, I think we feel very comfortable with our upstream growth continuing. Sub $55, definitely you could see a bit of a change in terms of forward CapEx.\nI also love the shift of CapEx. Last year, we were looking at 80%, 85% of global CapEx coming out of the Permian, and this year that shifted completely and you have a much more \u2013 you have much more global or international component to the CapEx, and, of course, our data sets are supporting those activities with all major players. So, I feel that\u2019s one place where cyclicality could come in, but then you have to look at the rest, PGCR, power, gas, renewables, liquid natural gas, U.S. exporter, replacement of coal, energy as a service, plastics, we\u2019re playing in \u2013 our chemicals team are playing in plastics and recycling and how all the big \u2013 just ran a big customer-driven study around plastics. And I just feel like we\u2019re in the hot bed of change with respect to climate. So, I think our PGCR business has continued upward momentum regardless of the energy markets, because policy and strategy is changing.\nAnd then finally in the downstream businesses, those continue to grow at upper single-digits. We\u2019ve \u2013 we made a small little chemicals pricing acquisition. We\u2019ve got our OPIS activities. We are world leaders in coal. We\u2019ve added data science around that in terms of pricing, coal \u2013 coal transportation, supply using some pretty advanced data science and that bodes well. So, again, I think there is a mix there. Upstream definitely got a cyclical component, mid-downstream can definitely hold its own or outperform. And then financial markets, really most of what we do in financial markets, people need regardless of volumes, sometimes when markets are thin, volumes are higher and were paid per trade. Again, yes, maybe in a downward cycle, we get to the lower end of that range, 3% to 5% in a really negative financial markets environment, but we are very well diversified. And so we feel that mid to slightly upper single-digits with the current assets we have bodes well for this year and we kind of reaffirm that today.\nAnd then CMS, a bit of a mute quarter. It\u2019s a smaller division, but in any other division, we wouldn\u2019t call out a contract renewal, but when it sits right in front of you and it\u2019s minus 3%, we\u2019ve got to explain why it is, but there is nothing really to report there and we reaffirmed \u2013 we took from low to mid to say low, that\u2019s probably the year\u2019s hedge. And put it altogether and we still feel really good about our 5% to 6%, our 100 basis points margin and our double-digit earnings growth. So, that was a long-winded answer, but covers the company. Next question?\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Tong\nHi, thanks, good morning. Your financial services recurring fixed organic revenue growth decelerated to 4% from 7% in the prior quarter despite easier year-ago comps. Can you discuss what drove the deceleration in the recurring business in financial services and what could drive a reacceleration?\nTodd Hyatt\nI don\u2019t think anything specifically drove it, George, I mean, we had very high growth last year, Q1, Q2. We\u2019ve said that this was a business, the information business is going to perform in the 4% to 6% range. We\u2019ve had a few quarters where we\u2019ve overperformed that. It\u2019s a healthy business performing well and there can be some in-quarter variability, there can be some comparisons to prior years, but there wasn\u2019t a specific item that I would call out in that part of the business, I think we continue to perform very well there. and we had a really strong non-recurring quarter. So, this sort of gets back to Lance\u2019s earlier point, you have \u2013 you\u2019re down a little bit in one area, you are up quite a lot in another area and you put it together and it\u2019s a really strong performance by Adam and the team again.\nLance Uggla\nYes, no, I think it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s nothing specific, but I would say if you take the last 8 or so years and you take that core information business, ex-Ipreo, it\u2019s been 4% to 9%, that\u2019s 2 years I think we\u2019re at low 4s, and then some years we\u2019ve been 7%, 8% or 9%, 3 or 4 years and the rest of the time kind of between 5% or 7%. I don\u2019t think I agree with Todd, nothing to call out there. We\u2019ve reaffirmed the year and I definitely \u2013 I feel our position in the marketplace around our growth engines, private capital markets are positioned in the loan and credit markets, you\u2019ve got lots of private equity moving into private credit, private debt that bodes really well for our businesses, pricing, et cetera.\nOur valuations team in more challenged illiquid market valuations if anything that bodes well. Our reg and compliance products and solutions, nobody asked any questions about that anymore, but that\u2019s been consistent double-digit growing now for many quarters and that\u2019s \u2013 that bodes well in this environment. And then the intersections in the organic growth coming from our merger still bodes well. And I think 0.75% to 1% per annum of organic growth coming from merger-related synergies is something that we can look at as a consistent player. So, if we do $30 million to $50 million a year from synergies with respect to cross-sell, new product development, data science analytics across the firm, I think that bodes really well and is in line with the merger and we continue to see that growth.\nSo \u2013 and that\u2019s because we have a financial markets franchise that\u2019s well regarded, that are \u2013 we\u2019re able to bring our energy, automotive, aerospace and defense, economics products into our customer base. And yes, that all bodes well for where we\u2019re going to end up this year, but it is the first quarter. We\u2019ve got 3 quarters to go, we\u2019ve got 1 month into the second quarter and we feel confident enough to reaffirm where we\u2019re going this year, but again, we never want to get ahead of ourselves. So, I think if you stick with the numbers as laid out, I hope we don\u2019t disappoint you. Next question?\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.\nAlex Kramm\nHey, good morning, everyone. I feel like I may be asking a similar question that have been asked a few times. But I just, I think Lance you just said it yourself, you still feel very, very confident about the guidance or you may even say you don\u2019t want to get ahead of yourself, but at the same time, some of the updates we\u2019ve heard today, CMS obviously taking down guidance, Ipreo at the low-end, and in energy, you had this kind of like a benefit that seems to be little bit one-time. So, everything seems to be maybe a softer start, but you\u2019re still very, very confident. So, just want to make sure I hear that correctly, because I think if you look at the run rate right now, there\u2019s a significant step-up that needs to come to make the rest of the year, just maybe I\u2019m hearing that\u2019s right?\nTodd Hyatt\nAlex, we\u2019ve talked about the seasonality in the business and I think if you go back and you look at the cadence of the business, Q1 just is the lowest quarter for this company, Q2, Q4, two biggest quarters. And so the business performance that we\u2019ve had to-date fully supports the numbers that we\u2019ve committed to on a full-year basis. When you look at Q1 and you look at Q1 versus prior year, it\u2019s a good solid quarter and organic revenue growth of 5%. Resources, yes, we did call it out, but I think the Resources number was probably ahead of where we expected it to be, because of the organic \u2013 because of the revenue accounting change, you normalize that, it\u2019s consistent with where we expected it to be maybe a shade ahead of where we expected it to be. So that one we called out. We \u2013 as Lance said I think CMS, a relatively immaterial event in the context of the company, in the context of CMS, it\u2019s a bigger number, so we called that out.\nCertainly, don\u2019t see that being impactful to the company\u2019s full-year performance. And when we look at the significant items that drive forward numbers and we look at ahead into Q2 and talk about things like some of the events that we have in Q2. Lance talked about CERAWeek and the performance that we\u2019ve had there, we feel certainly happy with that performance. And then general improvement in some of the underlying market activities, which we called out. So, I wouldn\u2019t read \u2013 I guess, I think you\u2019re reading too much between the lines, I think it\u2019s a solid quarter. We feel good about the start to the year and certainly have a clear path to deliver on a full-year basis.\nLance Uggla\nYes, I guess, if I add it to that and I always like to have maths that works when we give guidance and I kind of look at our four divisions and look at what are things that give me confidence in delivering 5% to 6% organic growth for the year. And if you take energy, if you want to take the 1% away from the software and you think energy is going to come in at 5%, you look at CMS and you go, well, they took away mids, it\u2019s going to be 2% to 3%. You look at financial markets, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 always it never fell below 4%, you could even put that at the lower end and you\u2019ve got high single-digits, 7% to 9%, 9% recurring this quarter if you\u2019re at even 7% or 8%. When you put that altogether, you still end up north of 5% and gives us great confidence to give a quarterly guidance at 5% to 6%. And I agree with Todd, I feel very solid, but also I think we also have a reputation of making sure that you\u2019re putting numbers that work into your models and ones that we\u2019re not going to let you down on and then you can make decisions accordingly. Next question?\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nToni Kaplan\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I did want to ask about the TMT contract renewal. Did you ultimately sign the contract or if not, was \u2013 did the customer go to a competitor or go in-house, if you did resign, was it on worse terms or was this all just a timing thing, and do you have any other large contracts coming up for renewal this year? Thank you.\nLance Uggla\nRight. So, every \u2013 all our divisions have large contracts every single quarter ranging from 100,000, which is small to millions which get larger and even $10 million, $20 million renewals. So, we\u2019re dealing with large contract renewals in every one of our divisions. And this particular contract renewal wouldn\u2019t even show up on a dial in any of the other three divisions. It just happens that CMS has three components and it\u2019s a bit more transparent and we wanted to give you a highlight to that. What I\u2019ll talk about in general is sometimes we have customers that \u2013 two customers can come together and form one customer. And when that happens \u2013 and that happens across financial markets, across asset management, automotive suppliers, energy companies. Our entire marketplace is filled with M&A activity that is never a smile for us. We don\u2019t get smiles when there is mergers because it means that we\u2019ll absorb in our 10% non-renewing recurring revenue every year. We\u2019ve got to work hard to rebuild that.\nAnd so we haven\u2019t lost the contract to any competitor. We have a contract delay, which may or may not come through, couldn\u2019t tell you, but the team has done a great job to position us well if it does get renewed. And it\u2019s now in our \u2013 it\u2019s been given to you, it\u2019s in the numbers, and there is nothing else unusual about anything in the firm that is worth pointing out. And it\u2019s a good question, Toni, but there is nothing unusual here except that it\u2019s in a division and a business where it is transparent. What I can say to you in TMT is that, our RootMetrics team has \u2013 ever since that acquisition some years back, it always had a handful of big customers.\nSo, it always had these single points of failure, which \u2013 what I really like about the team is, we\u2019ve started to diversify and grow in doing technology benchmarking across cloud services, Internet of Things, where we\u2019re looking at the benchmarking of sensors or we\u2019re looking at the cloud service providers. We really have diversified our benchmarking activities. And benchmarking is a great business and we wouldn\u2019t be able to do that without the team in Seattle that are \u2013 they are all PhDs, super-smart quants doing a great job, but they\u2019ve got some big customers that may decide to be together and therefore that has a in-quarter impact. Next question?\nOperator\nThank you. And our next quest comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJeff Silber\nThanks so much. Just one quick one, you had mentioned the potential impact of the government shutdown on the Ipreo business in terms of equity slowdown, was there any other impact in any other businesses, I think last quarter you talked about you might see some impact in your product design area?\nLance Uggla\nYes. I said last quarter that U.S. government and in-product design there was a continuing resolution process. And then once the government was funded, those contracts would be basically fully funded and released into revenue. And so we \u2013 that is occurring and we don\u2019t have concern about any government contracts from product design. I think that\u2019s our last question. So thank you everybody and I will turn it over to Eric.\nEric Boyer\nYes. We thank you for your interest on IHS Markit.

During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call.\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Charles Yager, Director of Product and Investor Advocacy. Sir, you may begin.\nCharles Yager\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.\nThis afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal fourth quarter ending December 31, 2020. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website.\nDuring the course of this conference call, Arista Networks\u2019 management will make forward-looking statements including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of the 2020 fiscal year, longer term financial outlooks, our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, our product innovation and the benefits of recent acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call.\nAlso, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release.\nWith that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jayshree.\nJayshree Ullal\nThank you, Charles. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. If there's one thing that pandemic has taught us, it's the importance of adapting in real-time. In 2020, our world changed quickly and rapidly.\nAs a cohesive leadership team, we had to prepare for a lot of unknowns and uncertainties where our offices were closed, our contract manufacturers were shutting down and supply chain constraints resulted in longer lead times. 2020 created a new norm as we found many virtual ways of communicating with our customers, including access to our products for their business continuity.\nWith vaccines emerging, we certainly hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these unprecedented times. I am so proud of our employees and how we've handled this and thank our partners and customers as well for placing their trust in us.\nBack to some Q4 2020 specifics. We delivered revenues of $648.5 million for the quarter with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49. A-Care services and software and support renewals contributed approximately 20% of our revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margin at 65% was influenced by software and services mix and a higher enterprise contribution for the quarter and the year.\nWe've registered a record number of new customer logos and million dollar customers, a direct result of our momentum in the enterprise vertical and campus this quarter. We now have surpassed 7,200 cumulative customers over the past decade.\nIn Q4 2020, Cloud Titan was our largest vertical. Enterprise was second, followed by financials in third place, and the providers, both service provider and cloud specialty providers tied for fourth place.\nIn terms of sector trends, we see Cloud Titans at approximately 36%, Enterprises, including financials at approximately 36%, and providers at approximately 28%, consistent with effective ranges we have provided. Microsoft was the only greater than 10% customer concentration at 21.5% for the year 2020. In terms of geographical mix, international contribution was slightly higher at 26%, with the Americas at 74% for Q4, 2020.\nDespite a turbulent 2020, especially with Cloud Titans, we believe Arista is going to emerge stronger with more diversified products and customers. We reiterate our multi-year growth part based on three major product line evolutions.\nOne, our core cloud and data center products built on a highly differentiated Arista EOS, these spine architecture and our cloud-first principle based on the 5 As. We expect this to contribute approximately 60% to 65% range in the future.\nOur second market is the network adjacencies, with routing replacing routers and our entry into the cognitive campus workspaces. We expect these two adjacencies together to contribute approximately in the range of 10% to 15%, as a compelling alternative to incumbent legacy networks.\nOur third category is network software and services. Based on subscription models, such as Arista Acare, CloudVision, multi-cloud EOS router, Big Switch DANZ monitoring fabric, or DMS, and advanced net of detection and response with the recent Awake Security acquisition.\nWe predict that these subscription-based network services and software will contribute approximately in the 25% range. Please note that perpetual software licenses are not included here and are generally counted in our core or adjacent product lines.\nAs we look ahead, analyst research has shown that customers believe that COVID-19 has actually increased the value and relevance of the network in the post pandemic era. And in our opinion, we concur.\nThe networking industry is undergoing a metamorphosis from point silos or places in the network to a seamless cognitive cloud network that is data-driven. Arista's helping customers with their digital transformation to this data-centric cloud-first paradigm.\nAs we experience the explosion of users, devices, IoT, OT, more video, more mobility of workloads and workflows. The boundary between all the locations, whether it's your office, cloud, home, Teleworker and transit and user is really blurring into elastic workspaces. We believe Arista is well-positioned to address the data-driven networks for this client-to-cloud workspaces.\nWe are powering some of the world's largest data centers and cloud providers as a trusted partner. And this expertise that we have gained has helped us modernize networking to a software-driven cognitive experience.\nA good example of this is Arista's Q4 2020 introduction of DMS or DANZ monitoring fabric for contextual observability based on our Big Switch acquisition that we did earlier in 2020.\nOur Zero Trust Vision that we launched this month also cements the relevance of a differentiated network protection and security. Our holistic Zero Trust network requires the union of network segmentation, situational awareness and visibility and network detection and response security. A key part of our strategy is to bring these cloud-first principles to every aspect of our cloud network. So we bring it to routing, observability and security functions, and it must be inherently designed as a part of the Arista state and AI-driven network architecture and foundation.\nSo with this, I'd like to invite Ken Duda, our Founder and Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, to share some of our latest innovations on security. Ken?\nKenneth Duda\nThanks, Jayshree. A Zero Trust framework for security is top of mind at Arista. For so many years, networking vendors have focused, first and foremost, on providing connectivity that is making sure everything can talk to everything else. This was fine in the 1980s, but it makes no sense today where security is a greater concern than ever for many of our customers, more important than connectivity itself.\nArista is addressing the needs of security-conscious operators by integrating security directly into our network devices so that the network is secure from day one without bolt-on security products. You've already heard about the Awake acquisition and progress in AI-driven network detection and response.\nI'd like to go a little deeper on this call into another innovative Arista security feature called Macro-Segmentation Service Groups, or MSSG. With MSSG, the operator assigns endpoints to segments. Based on the type of device that's connecting, the user of that device and/or the applications they are using. The operator then specifies a segmentation policy. Specifying which pairs of segments are permitted to communicate.\nFor example, the policy might permit corporate engineering laptops to connect to manufacturing applications but not to the finance applications and not even to one another.\nMSSG enforces that policy uniformly, whether wired or wireless, whether on the campus or in the data center, on-premises or working remotely. The operator can change the policy, including reassigning an endpoint to a different segment without requiring any other changes to the network.\nIn particular, the policy is completely independent of network address assignment, which can be quite important. For example, if the user device behaves suspiciously, it can be reassigned to an untrusted segment without triggering any network change events on the device so that the compromised device can be quarantined and investigated without tipping off the adversary that they have been detected.\nArista's MSSG works with 100% standards-based packets without adding any proprietary headers, trailers, encapsulations, et cetera, and is thus, easy to deploy incrementally into existing networks.\nFinally, enforcement is implemented entirely in hardware for high-performance without relying on expensive switch TCAMs for classification, which has led to scale problems in competing solutions.\nOur view is that MSSG is an example of a larger trend in networking, where Moore's Law is enabling a larger and larger feature set to be integrated into mainstream, switching and routing devices.\nThis integration is essential to move beyond security as an afterthought and provide solutions that are secure off the shelf. And I'm delighted in the role, Arista is able to play in helping customers address the challenges of building and operating a modern network, not just from a performance and scale perspective, but including so many other aspects such as visibility, manageability, monitoring, provisioning, process automation and, of course, security. Thanks. Back to you, Jayshree.\nJayshree Ullal\nThank you, Ken. Clearly, customers are fatigued with the proprietary and silo networking you just mentioned. And just as we all modernize the cloud network, security must turn from a noun to an adjective to build secure networks.\nKen, your world-class engineering team has mastered the art of quality and software architecture with best-in-class agility and programmability, credit to you for founding and building this innovation and greatness in Arista, and I can't wait to see more of it.\nIn addition to our campus workspaces progress that I spoke about last time, next-generation routing is another key adjacent market. Our investments in simplification of Arista's routing stack has been going on for many years with standards-based EVPN, VXLAN, BGP and segment routing, and these are yielding good traction in cloud service provider and enterprise customer wins.\nTo give you context on this, just in 2020 alone, we introduced six EOS software releases across 40 platforms and delivered over 800 features in routing. The result of these investments we have made in our routing, innovation and footprint have brought us over 200 customers in 2020.\nIn summary, Arista demonstrates a stark contrast to the current fatigue of silos and different operating systems for WAN, campus, cloud, data center, each one generating its own disparate data silos. We are building upon our cloud networking heritage to unify data sets consistently and harnessing and archiving data across one software stack EOS and one CloudVision.\nThe networking industry is truly ripe for this transition and change to data-driven networking. Simply put, a good enough mediocre network is no longer good enough and acceptable. And this is why we believe that we're poised for multi-year inflection ahead.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for the financial specifics. Ita?\nIta Brennan\nThanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2020 results and our guidance for Q1 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release.\nTotal revenues in Q4 were $648.5 million, up 17.4% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $615 million to $635 million. While we continue to strive for improvements on the supply chain front, shipments remained somewhat constrained in the quarter, with some COVID second and third wave-related disruptions.\nService and software support renewals represented approximately 20% of total revenue, down slightly from 21% last quarter. International revenues for the quarter came in at $165.7 million, or 26% of total revenue, up from 25% in the third quarter.\nWhile the shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis is largely due to the location of deployments by our third - by our cloud titan customers, we did see some incremental improvement in our in region businesses this quarter.\nOverall gross margins in Q4 were a healthy 65%. At the upper end of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65%, reflecting a heavier mix of shipments to our enterprise and financial customers in the period.\nOperating expenses for the quarter were $178.1 million, or 27.5% of revenue, up from last quarter at $159.4 million. We continue to increase operating expense investments during the quarter as our top line performance for the year continued to improve.\nR&D spending came in at $110.2 million, or 17% of revenue, up from $106.1 million last quarter. This reflected increased employee costs, somewhat offset by lower new product introduction spending in the period.\nSales and marketing expense was $54.9 million, or 8.5% of revenue, up from $43.1 million last quarter with increased variable compensation and other headcount-related charges. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses.\nOur G&A costs came in at $13 million, or 2% of revenue of revenue, up from last quarter at approximately $10.2 million, reflecting normal fourth quarter compliance-related activities. Our operating income for the quarter was $243.5 million, or 37.6% of revenue.\nOther income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.4 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.3%. Other income and expense included $2.5 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amounts.\nThe favorable tax rate included the release of some tax reserves, for which the statute of limitations expired in the period. This was a one-time effect, and the rate will likely return to a more structural rate of 21.9% in future periods.\nOverall, this resulted in net income for the quarter of $197.7 million or 30.5% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.3 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.49, up approximately 9% from the prior year.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the year at approximately $2.87 billion. To recap on our uses of cash for the year, we generated $735 million of cash from operations and returned approximately $395 million, or 54%, of this to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.\nIn addition, we used approximately $227 million, or 31%, to fund cash consideration for two acquisitions, which closed during the year, retaining the balance of approximately $113 million in the business.\nTo date, we have repurchased $661 million, or 3.2 million shares, against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over three years commencing in Q2 2019. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate.\nTurning to the operational cash performance for the fourth quarter. We generated $186.9 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments in working capital.\nDSOs came in at 55 days, up from 46 days in Q3, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.8 times, down from 2 times last quarter. Inventory increased to $480 million in the quarter, up from $438 million in the prior period, as we continue to buffer certain components and products.\nOur total deferred revenue balance was $651 million, up from $562 million in Q3. This increase largely reflected typical fourth quarter service renewal activity and a small amount of deferred product revenue related to new product deployments.\nThe level of services deferred revenue is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Accounts payable days were 54 days, down from 70 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 million.\nNow turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. We saw good diversification of the business in fiscal 2020, with expected declines in cloud titan revenue, somewhat offset by growth in our other market sectors.\nLooking to 2021, we expect continued growth with our enterprise and provider customers, combined with the solid cloud titan contribution. From a product perspective, we expect strength in adjacencies and software and services continue to make these areas a more meaningful contributor to the business over time.\nWe believe the combination of these trends, combined with favorable year-over-year comparatives allowed for a top line growth rate for the year, which is in line with annual consensus growth rates of 14% to 15%.\nYou should also note that our second half 2020 top line recovery will likely result in some deceleration in quarterly year-over-year growth rates as we move through 2021. On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65% with customer mix remaining the key driver.\nTurning to spending and investments. We remain committed to making go forward results based investments in the business. This includes continued go-to-market expansion to support enterprise and campus growth and investments in R&D to support innovation across the business.\nFinally, our outlook discussion above and our guidance for Q1, reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This is, however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds.\nWith all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows, revenues of approximately $630 million to $650 million, gross margin 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9% with diluted shares of approximately 80 million shares.\nI will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles?\nCharles Yager\nThank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time constraints, I\u2019d like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall\nGreat. Thank you. Maybe just a comment around - you just announced the kind of Macro Segmentation kind of security portfolio. Just as your broadening out the campus portfolio, just other security features and functionalities that you think you will need or other partnerships that you think you'll need to expand upon to just, kind of, address that customer base that maybe the needs are different than the data center needs? Thanks.\nJayshree Ullal\nThanks, Meta. And as you know, we've had a very robust set of partnerships. So we will be working on securing the network. But protecting the network is only one aspect of the data center or campus. You have to make sure you work with - different types of firewall vendors. You have to protect the cloud and the multi-cloud zones. You have to protect the devices and the identity.\nSo Macro Segmentation has multiple fronts. We enforce a lot of roles to our partnerships with firewall [Technical Difficulty] more and more identity mapping and enforcement with our partners like Forescout as well as Aruba, ClearPass and Okta. So the first thing I want to say is, security is too important for just Arista to do. We'll be securing and protecting the network and working with these partners.\nLooking ahead, we see other forms of security, too. And I'd love for Ken or Anshul to comment because whether it is securing the networks and segmentation and the many forms we talked about. But also more and more in the data center encryption capabilities and privacy, whether it's network-wide or how to pop and in the campus, bringing security all the way down to our wireless. So Ken or Anshul, do you want to say something more about that?\nAnshul Sadana\nSure, Jayshree. Helping our enterprise customers connect to the cloud is extremely important. And as you know, there's no one single way to connect your enterprise apps to these cloud apps. There are 1,000 different ways, whether it's Express, Direct Connect, Different Hops, Meet Me In The Middle, different service providers. And we're quite focused on enabling more and more functionality there with different forms of tunneling, taking our Vaseline EVPN approach for enterprises and marrying it to what happens on the cloud side, different types of encryption channels and so on. Ken, anything you want to add?\nKenneth Duda\nYes. I just wanted to add that we - our segmentation is simply the newest announcement that we've made in this area. But we have a robust portfolio of security features already, including hardware support for Mac second IPSEC to secure individual links, including multistage ACLs for advanced Packet classification, and several other features, wireless intrusion prevention.\nSo I think that, customers are already able to build a fully secured network on, networking solutions. And that said, well, of course, be looking to partner, in the future with anyone who can help us build a more secure solution.\nMeta Marshall\nOkay. Great. Thanks.\nCurtis McKee\nThanks, Meta.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.\nRyan Koontz\nHi. Thanks for question. I wanted to ask you about the semi supply chain. You talked about building inventory in the quarter on key parts. Can you give us a little more color on, what's going on there? We do hear about production capacity issues, and obviously, lead times are starting to stretch out, you feel you give us some comfort you feel comfortable with your commitments from your suppliers and what you're seeing out there? I appreciate it. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal\nSure. Ryan, as we said, we have been constrained much of 2020, starting with March. So this has been a real issue for the entire supply chain. We have products with extremely large lead times that we plan ahead for. And I would be remiss, if I didn't say we while we have some great partners, that the semiconductor supply chain is still constrained.\nIta and her team, as well as Anshul and the team have taken some very important steps, to build out our inventory for some of these long lead time components, but we could use a lot more parts than we still have.\nRyan Koontz\nHelpful. Thanks very much.\nJayshree Ullal\nThanks, Ryan.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader\nYes. Thank you. Jayshree, can you talk about what's driving your momentum in the enterprise would you say it's more of the product portfolio that's expanded, or is it just the build-out of your sales and distribution infrastructure? Or maybe it's both?\nJayshree Ullal\nYes. I think the simple answer, Jason, is it is both. We've been making multiyear investments on both the product side. First of all, both in the data center but also going beyond the data center to different roles and use cases.\nAnd Anshul and Chris Schmidt, and Ashwin and the team have been building out our capacity, both in the US and internationally. But I would say the third thing that's also clicking is our best-of-breed product capability.\nIt's one thing to invest in it, but customers are really resonating with a single OS, cloud vision being a huge differentiator. We just crossed over 1,000 CloudVision customers since we started shipping this product a few years ago.\nSo I think the ability to not just build a great network, but to operate it, and for them to experience that quality of experience has made it much more complete. So I would say great products, great go-to-market and then a high-quality operation and experience.\nJason Ader\nGreat. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal\nThanks, Jason.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall\nYes. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to ask about the vertical with regards to providers, you guys beat that pretty solidly against our expectations. So maybe a little bit more color there. And then cloud was a little bit weak.\nAnd I'm just curious if you guys are still thinking you can grow cloud this year and is it a single-digit growth rate, et cetera? Maybe you don't want to talk about that. But just curious what your thoughts are on cloud growth this year? Thanks.\nJayshree Ullal\nRight, Rod. Well, as you know, cloud has been tough for us and pretty volatile. The visibility on Cloud Titan was very difficult last year. On the other hand, as we've been telling you, we're starting to make good penetration in both Tier 2, Tier 3 service providers as well as our Tier 2 cloud providers. So that has come up nicely to make up for some of the volatility in our Titans.\nIn terms of asking you question, of the things we felt in Q4, we did achieve was we were firing on all five verticals in all three sectors. But because we had so much volatility in titans, overall in the year, we were down. And Anshul, you may want to add to that is that, in our view, there is no reflection on the strength and an intimacy of our preferred partnership with our Cloud Titans. But we did have some delays in their qualification of 400-gig and in spite of all the new products we had, decisions took longer to happen. Anshul, do you want to comment on that?\nAnshul Sadana\nSure. Jason, our work with the cloud titans collaboration, co-development partnership is coming along fairly well, both for 400-gig as well as 200-gig, we believe we will start to see these ramping second half of the year. And we believe we will do well with the cloud. The Cloud Titan numbers for us are already large. So obviously, you'll never have seen growth rates, but we believe our business will remain solid with them.\nOperator\nAnd your next\u2026\nRod Hall\nThank you. And\u2026\nJayshree Ullal\nThanks, Rod.\nRod Hall\nI was going to say on providers. I don't know if you had any comment on that, but.\nJayshree Ullal\nProviders are doing well for us. They tend to be seasonal. It depends on when a provider is investing. So I think our specialty providers, some of them are coming back very strong, and they had less investments the prior year. And some of them are also recognizing that they need to be a specialty cloud, just as the name suggests. And not rely on the public cloud. So it's effect we are feeling more optimistic about.\nRod Hall\nGreat. Okay. Thanks, Jayshree.\nJayshree Ullal\nThanks, Rod.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Amit Daryani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryani\nFirst of all, congrats on a really good quarter given all the craziness the year has had. I guess my question really is, as I think about the calendar 2021 guide, March, I think, will be up 22%, 23% year-over-year. And I think the full year guidance implied to be on 14%. Beyond the compares, could you just maybe talk about why do you think growth will decelerate as we go through the year, especially given the comments, I think Anshul made about 400-gig ramping up in the back half? Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal\nYes. Amit, I think it's really all about kind of if you look at the trend from last year, I mean, it was really a year of two halves, right? You had some very constrained lower numbers in the first half. And then, obviously, we started to recover and exit the year with a very respectable revenue top line number.\nSo a lot of it has to do with the comps. I think you have to think about it more this year, just in terms of progress as we move through the year than necessarily trying to target a particular year-over-year growth rate, just because of how the volatility that we saw in 2020.\nIta Brennan\nAnd Amit, just to add to that, yes, we are confident of our position with Cloud Titans. But as you know, our near-term visibility is always better than our long-term. So we'll know better as we go quarter-by-quarter. And I'm looking forward on sure to you raising the forecast.\nAnshul Sadana\nAmit, don't ask those questions again.\nAmit Daryani\nUnlike, she just - thank you very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Kvaal\nYes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first, perhaps for Jayshree or Anshu. Could you help us understand where you stand in the value proposition with WiFi and SD WAN? And I bring that up because a lot of your peers in the market will make much of what they are up to in both of those particular categories.\nAnd then, I guess, secondarily, either for you, could you perhaps frame for us a bit about the magnitude of the revenue left on the table in the in the fourth quarter? And to what extent that's a factor in your first quarter guidance as well?\nJayshree Ullal\nOkay, Jeff, we'll try to address your two-part question, we'll do our best. So specific to Wifi, we view this as a very important component of our overall cognitive workspaces portfolio, but we are not competing directly with Cisco or Aruba or anybody else on the controller based traditional WiFi architecture. So our approach to WiFi has been very much like our approach to optics.\nWe're not an optical vendor, but we view WiFi and optics as an accessory to provide that cognitive inference, AI-driven architecture so that you can seamlessly connect across wired and WiFi. So CloudVision supports wired and WiFi. We have a unified edge that supports wired and Wifi.\nOur WiFi will lead to migration as customers may need into LTE or 4G or 5G. So to us, WiFi is almost a technology and a feature, not a market segment, but it's critical to bringing our wired, wireless, unified leaf spine architecture that we extended from the data center into the campus. So I think our competitors are looking at it more traditionally, and we're looking at modern workspaces.\nAs for SD-WAN, we've been very clear that we are not in that market space. We look at some of the SD-WAN attributes of features and an extension of our WAN routing. So -- but other than that, we're not in that low-end market where we're supplying branch offices to SMBs like VeloCloud or Meraki Might.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nSami Badri\nHi. Thank you very much. My question has more to do with quantification of the campus switching or enterprise opportunity. Could you be able to give us kind of a quantified number or revenue run rate that you guys came in at as of fourth Q 2020?\nAnd Jayshree, I think before, you have guided us to where you want to be at some point from a run rate basis. Has that time line accelerated? Or has it contracted? Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal\nSami, I think we told you we wanted to achieve at least $100 million in 2020, and we certainly achieved that. In fact, we exceeded it. And our goal is to double that in this year, and we'll give you more quantification as the year progresses.\nSo we're on track. We're executing well. I won't say it's changed dramatically. Obviously, COVID has slowed down some of the large campus decision-making, but I think it's going to get better.\nSami Badri\nGot it. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open.\nPaul Silverstein\nJust a clarification question. The clarification, take it is basic math with Facebook for the full year was less than $230 million, maybe meaningfully less, but it certainly wasn't more. If I did the math correctly, that would be down over 40%. I'm just wondering, hoping you could confirm that, if not tell us what it was? And then the question would be for Jayshree and the rest of the team. \nJayshree, can you talk about your entry into these various ancillary markets, whether fabric monitoring, automation, et cetera. I think you gave us the breakdown, which I appreciate, in terms of the contribution of revenue. But any thoughts on what type of growth? I suspect some news like fabric monitoring are coming off essentially for ground zero.\nYou touched to the Big Switch acquisition, albeit I think that of presence would monitoring for a while now. But any sense you can give us for what type of growth you're looking at outside of data center switching with as much granularity as you can summit?\nIta Brennan\nYes, Paul, just to close up on the Facebook. I mean, they were 16.6% of revenue last year. And obviously, they're down below 10% this year. So I think that gives you something to work with, right?\nPaul Silverstein\nOkay.\nJayshree Ullal\nAnd Paul, as you know, the two types of software. There's the perpetual licenses, where we do some monitoring with what we call DANZ, Data Analyzer that's built in with our switches and routers. And then there's a subscription. So unlike many of our peers, we're not just converting perpetual into subscription.\nOur subscription-based software is really new markets, new markets like our Big Switch, DANZ monitoring, fabric, CloudVision, obviously, multi-cloud US router. And then we're very, very excited about the recent acquisition of Awake Security. \nSo the revenue will trail the subscription, but -- and we're obviously starting off a small number. So it would be remiss if we didn't grow double-digits on those small numbers. We expect to grow much faster than our 14% to 15% annual growth that Ita described. I believe we leave that when we show our execution.\nPaul Silverstein\nAny thoughts on what that could be in dollar contribution?\nJayshree Ullal\nWell, what I did say is between A-Care Services, software renewals and all of these software, we expected it to be in the 25% range looking ahead. \nPaul Silverstein\nLooking ahead.\nJayshree Ullal\nAnd again, I think it's important to think of that as trends, not exact revenue because revenue lags the bookings.\nCurtis McKee\nThank you, Paul. Next question?\nOperator\nYour next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJames Fish\nHey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Just actually wanted to go off of Rod's question before. Appreciate the year-end disclosure, but I'm curious if you could actually talk about what did happen with your second largest historical customer on why it was cut by somewhere around 50%, even backing up the deferred haircut, it's still a pretty massive cut. \nAnd related to this, it would imply that given the cloud vertical exposure that you had an uptick up, which I'm guessing was for Q4, not just the entire year, but that another large hyperscaler actually had has some strength underneath. So just kind of curious if you can walk us through the cloud titans vertical more specifically? Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal\nSure, James. First of all, our cloud titan verticals consist of only the major cloud scale customers, right? And we list them, but they are your usual suspects that you know. So we do have other cloud titan customers besides Microsoft and Facebook to clarify your question. Facebook, we've discussed a lot in the past.\nAs you know, they had a change in their product line where they skipped the service cycle. And we saw the loss of that, especially in second -- late 2019 and also March of 2020. So we're looking forward to it coming back. Anshul, do you want to add anything more to that or?\nAnshul Sadana\nThat's it. We've been fairly transparent with what happened there on the CD cycle changes their plans for deployments and so on. And I think actually, everything rolled out, as we had stated almost four quarters ago.\nJames Fish\nGot it. Thanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open.\nDavid Vogt\nThanks, guys and great quarter. So just maybe a quick follow-up on the supply disruptions. Can you provide more detail around sort of the nature of the disruption you experienced? And what I mean by that is, can you comment on sort of the magnitude of the impact in the quarter? What it might look like in the first quarter maybe the sector where you're seeing more of an exposure and maybe timing around your ability to recover those lost sales? Thanks.\nIta Brennan\nYes. I mean I think, look, it's more of an extended lead time environment than it is anything else, right? And we're working very closely with customers to make sure that we're not losing business, right, that we're actually planning carefully with them and prioritizing what's most important to them, right?\nSo I think we had hoped, if we talked this time last quarter, we had hoped to see more of a recovery in the fourth quarter than we did just because we saw more COVID-related disruptions around -- we lost some manufacturing capacity on and off because of COVID activities in different locations. The supply chain, some of the suppliers into that supply chain, sell that as well, right?\nSo it's just -- I don't know that it's that's different to where we have been. And as we head into Q1, I think we're in a similar position. So there's no great disruption to the numbers, I think, coming out of changes in that environment. We just didn't make maybe as much progress as we would have liked, right? So we're continuing to just stay close to customers and prioritize, but we're also trying to make sure we don't lose business as part of that.\nJayshree Ullal\nAnd I just want to acknowledge that the manufacturing team, led by John McCool is doing a really good job with Anshul's leadership. We're doing the best we can, but we haven't recovered.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Jayshree, you guys have strong results in enterprise, and that's good to see. But you did mention campus sales cycles are probably still a bit long. But when we focus on the overall data center part of enterprise, I just wanted to check, like how are you what are you seeing in terms of drivers of growth there? Is it more of a land next band with the existing customers? Or are you -- what momentum are you seeing in relation to new logos on the core data center part of the enterprise customer base?\nJayshree Ullal\nYes. Actually, Samik, that's a really good question. Many enterprise customers are looking at us as the thought leader on how they should proceed with their workloads in the cloud. So I think by virtue of being consultative with them, what we're finding is some workloads move to the cloud, but many of them end up creating more data center capability that they need for some of their premise workloads.\nSo this enterprise number that we are sharing absolutely includes more than campus. It includes existing customers, land and expand as well as new logos. We had one of our best ever quarters on not only new customer logos, but million dollar customers. So you can imagine that wasn't just campus, and so there was a lot of data center in there.\nSamik Chatterjee\nPerfect. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal\nThanks, Samik.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Fahad Najam with MKM Partners. Your line is open.\nFahad Najam\nThank you for taking my question. I had a big picture question on architectures. We often hear from the cloud hyperscale operators talking about 800 gig and using silicon photonics to expand the search Redi in order to reduce the number of layers in their data center network. How should we think about that impacting your revenue outlook from your hyperscale customers? Should they achieve expanding the Radi architecture that you're talking about today?\nJayshree Ullal\nYes. Just before I hand it to Anshul, he's perfect to answer this. We believe Arista is number one today in both 100-gig and 400-gig, including 200, right? And the 100-gig market is easily 40 times bigger than the 400-gig. And anybody planning 800-gig is typically doing so in a much longer term, especially for optics, right?\nSo in general, if you just step back and look at 400-gig, the calls have shifted out by a year, and we expect production mainly in the second half. So we're still in the world of 100, 200 and 400-gig, I believe, this year. But Ansul, do you have some more?\nAnshul Sadana\nAbsolutely. Fahad, your question is right on point, but it is a sort of a futuristic discussion, because this is not something that's going to happen in the next one or two years. Customers always like to collapse layers in the network because that is significant saving on cost and power. At the same time, their to larger clusters, which results in adding layer.\nAnd as a result of that, we have a balanced that as you may know, our largest switch can support 230 terabits of throughput in a single switch. And for some of these large Cloud Titans, that's still not big enough. They would like bigger to Save one more layer of the network.\nSo we're constantly engaged in these discussions as we move from 50-gig SerDes, which is where we are today, the 400-gig cord to 100-gig SerDes. Some of these architectural points will come up. But I think, by the end, this really hits, it may be when 224 gigs ears come out, that's at least six years out, maybe five. It's very hard to predict that. And that's when I think you'll see some of these changes.\nJayshree Ullal\nThat's very visionary. Thank you, Anshul.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSimon Leopold\nThanks for taking the question. I wanted to see, if you could touch on the routing use cases. You mentioned in the prepared remarks the expansion of feature set. And I appreciate that there's a bit of a spectrum between switching and routing. But if you can give us a little bit more color in terms of the revenue that this is contributing as well as your outlook for the growth in these maybe wide area network and routing functional cases within your data center deployments? Thanks.\nJayshree Ullal\nSure. Simon, I think, as you know, this is a very important part of our adjacency. And I would sort of describe our success in routing in three areas. There are very specific use cases in service providers. We were doing very well, especially with routing and residential edge and bringing that edge capability for mobile edge or EBP and edge, et cetera. Then there's a second, which is an extension of our data center where we go into peering points, and these could be cloud providers, but they could also be enterprises in conjunction with service providers.\nAnd then there's a third, which is building the Telco cloud itself, where many people are looking \u2013 many customers are looking to build the same cloud-like principles inside their service provider network. Anshul, do you want to add something more to that?\nAnshul Sadana\nJust it's pretty much so everything else at the data center, the cloud connecting to the backbone, backbone to the Internet, the Internet connecting to pivot points and then to the service providers and DS customers. I think we're actually doing fairly well, marching along that journey. There's a lot that has been done. There's still a lot more to be done, but I think we do very well keep growing in that space.\nSimon Leopold\nAny quantification you can offer?\nJayshree Ullal\nAs we said in the opening remarks, our goal is, together with campus for this adjacent sector to be 10% to 15% of our business, looking forward. And also remember, we struggled a little bit with how to count routing. So we try to be very disciplined about counting routing only when there's routing. So if it's combined with switching, it still goes into core.\nSimon Leopold\nThanks for that.\nJayshree Ullal\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers\nYes. Thanks for taking the question, and also congratulations on the quarter. I apologize to go back to this, but in the context of kind of your guidance and the discussion around your second largest customer, I'm just curious how you thought about the move to this next-generation server cycle with Ice Lake and AMDs, Milan, and also in the context of that second largest customer, giving a CapEx guide, that looks like it's up about 40% year-over-year.\nHow did you factor that into your outlook commentary for the full year? Or is that something that you consider, ' Hey, let's see if this CapEx guide comes to fruition and I'd rather take a conservative view on how that filters into the Arista business. Just curious how you thought about that?\nJayshree Ullal\nAaron, I think that's an excellent question. Given we got burned the last time, on some of the forecasts, and we do think that we are going to take a much more pragmatic view. And our view is really that it's a multiyear spend, not just in 2021. So there's clearly going to be some good CapEx improvements from 2020 to 2021 specifically, but we're not counting at all for this year.\nAaron Rakers\nJust to be clear, remind me again of how your business trails kind of server cycle again?\nJayshree Ullal\nYes. That's a good question. Anshul, why don't you describe that?\nAnshul Sadana\nAaron, what I would say here is, do not try to correlate us short-term to any cloud titan spend because they can spend their CapEx in many different ways. And it's only correlated to our business in the long-term, never in the short term.\nJayshree Ullal\nAnd typically, there's a lag of a few quarters, right? So the CapEx can be building, cooling, air conditioning, server storage before we think of the network.\nAaron Rakers\nThat\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.\nJayshree Ullal\nThank you, Aaron.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long\nThank you. I just wonder if I could. Could you talk a little bit about when we're starting to think about these adjacencies and the service and software lines, how are you thinking about getting to those growth out of those areas and those splits of the business that you talked about as far as kind of cross-selling the core portfolio and the existing customers, I would assume switch to routing is pretty synergistic.\nBut could you talk a little bit about how much you're expecting to cross-sell into new Canvas customers, new software customers or what might -- just might be some new growth areas outside of where the core products are really strong? Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal\nYes. No, Tim, that's a really good question. I think we will rely very much on our sales force and our strength with our existing customers to achieve adjacency in campus. And the same is true for routing as well. It's a very natural way to go because it's a directed sale for large big bets and segments of customers.\nHowever, we will complement that so while on adjacencies will rely on our 7,000 or more customers. In the case of campus, we're spending a lot of time and energy on how to augment that with channels and partner distribution. And in the case of software and subscription services, it's not always connected.\nSo Anshul and the team are putting a fair amount of effort on not really just hiring salespeople, but creating systems engineering expertise. So building that expertise for DMS, building that for a week is an important aspect because often, they may be the same customer, but they may be a different decision maker. So that go-to-market is a little more nuanced for the software and subscription, but somewhat similar for the adjacency.\nTim Long\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal\nThanks, Tim.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson\nThank you very much. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the emergence of codes infrastructure, the CI/CD pipelining of micro services, edge compute and how that's going to change traffic patterns and purchasing of your products over time, and particularly around the implication of the service mesh at the edge. I would think that -- you've been talking about points in the cloud in places in the cloud for a really long time. \nAnd this architectural change effectively makes individuals and applications simply points in the cloud if we play out that strategy. And therefore, data and IT protection becomes critical. So how are you thinking about those aspects of the emergence and adoption of Kubernetes, micro-services, CI/CD pipeline and the like impacting your business?\nJayshree Ullal\nI don't know if Ken is still on the line to address this in more detail. But I think, in general, we believe a data-driven network coming to the Edge, whether the sources are multi-cloud, wireless, 4G, 5G. WAN, Kubernetes, et cetera, is very relevant to the way we develop our software. Ken, you want to add a little more?\nKenneth Duda\nYes. Sure. No, I think that we're very well aware of those directions, and we're maximizing our relevance there in a couple of ways. The first is what's required for that whole computing model for scaling out your application horizontally across Kubernetes is a uniform physical networking fabric. You need low latency from physical edge to physical edge, regardless of where the Kubernetes clusters are deployed. And you need to be able to deploy them in a lot of different places, like you mentioned with edge compute. \nAlso some enterprises need to be on-premises for various reasons belong to same application architecture that they use in the cloud as well. And so there's a need to have this same sort of repeatable rollout process of the underlying infrastructure for those Kubernetes-based environments, whether it's on-prem, edge compute or in the cloud. And that's what we've achieved with CloudVision studios. So I don't know if we've talked about this much in the context of the earnings call. \nBut CloudVision studios enables us to -- enabled our customers to create automation frameworks, so they can easily spin up new fabric deployments, new pods and absolutely with supporting Kubernetes in mind.\nJayshree Ullal\nAnd this is probably a great topic for Analyst Day, Alex, but stay tuned for more here.\nAlex Henderson\nI appreciate the answer. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal\nThanks, Alex.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Your line is open.\nJon Lopez\nThank you so much. Ita, I was wondering if you could just talk a second about deferred. The short-term and deferred was like really, really strong, best in multiple years. And I'm wondering what was in that, whether or wake had any influence on that? And then I think within that, you talked about perhaps some product deferred in there. And I was just wondering if you could talk to us about maybe when that layers in, so we don't get tripped up, which happened a couple of years back. So sorry for that, but can you just maybe discuss all those things quickly?\nIta Brennan\nI mean the driver in the uptick in Q4 was really around services and services renewals, right? I mean Q4 is a big typically a fairly large renewal quarter, and we had some larger customers renew prior period renewals of services.\nThat's by far the biggest driver. There's a little bit of product, but it is small. Just pure new customer, new product stuff, but that's a much, much smaller part of it, right? It's really more services and the services.\nJayshree Ullal\nAnd Awake is too small and too early to call that number.\nIta Brennan\nYes.\nJon Lopez\nGot you. Okay. Thanks for the help.\nIta Brennan\nThanks, John.\nJayshree Ullal\nThanks, John.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGeorge Notter\nThank you. Thanks a lot for the question. I just wanted if you your thoughts on how you see customers deploying 400-gig? And do you think there's an opportunity to upgrade some of the 100-gig installed base to 400-gig in the early stages? Or will much of the initial 400-gig ramp be coming from net new port growth?\nJayshree Ullal\nWell, I think, George, I've always said this, there's a strong correlation, especially with our cloud customers on 100-gig and 400-gig being tied as we move to a 400-gig spine, you still need a lot of 100-gig tributaries. And in the past, that besides COVID, we haven't had effective available optics. I think all of that is shifted 400-gig by a year, but this is a year we really see 400-gig will be deployed, especially in the second half.\nJust to give this in context, while we have over 7,000 customers, we have about 75 customers already deploying 400-gig in some fashion. So it's about 1% or less than 1% of our aggregate base, and so 100-gig will continue to be relevant as we augment with 400-gig, both in our high-end cloud and enterprise and service providers.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nBen Bollin\nGood afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Could you address a little bit more about the recurring software and service revenue opportunity? Specifically, I'd be interested in what types of customers and verticals do you see as really driving that transition? Do you have opportunities to gain traction there with your hyperscale accounts? And then Ita, any high-level thoughts on contract terms, average length or invoice methodology would be helpful. Thanks.\nIta Brennan\nSure, Ben. I think the biggest and most attractive verticals for the software subscription would be enterprises and financials. I love to get it into others as well, but these would be the two big areas of target. And there's clearly a lot of verticals in there, sub verticals, and we're already seeing a lot of interest in the financial markets for that software and subscription, and I expect we'll see many more.\nJayshree Ullal\nYes. And a lot of this is built upfront, and it's a two to three-year type kind of term contract term, if you like, and usually, we're collecting kind of -- we're billing and collecting cash upfront so far. I mean, that may change over time, depending on the size of the customer. But so far, that's kind of been the model.\nBen Bollin\nThank you.\nJayshree Ullal\nThanks.\nOperator\nYour last question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup Research. Your line is open.\nJim Suva\nThank you. And my sincere granulation on good results and outlook.\nJayshree Ullal\nThank you, Jim.\nJim Suva\nIn your prepared remarks, I think I heard some numbers thrown out like 36%, 36%, 28%. And I think that was for the vertical mixes Was that more for the year out or all long, long-term and the reason I'm asking the question is, is your guidance of, I think you said, up 12% for next year, and it's off easy comp.\nI'm just trying to figure out which of those three markets you're seeing the most strength? Because if I look at those percents, it almost seems like it's a lot coming from service providers, but maybe I'm bridging that incorrectly. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal\nYes. Jim, thank you for the good wishes. So the trends are not exact revenue for Q4, but it is our best indicator of how we think the year ahead will roll out. So we'll keep updating it every quarter to give you an idea of not how it's rolling out, but how it's actually turning out.\nSo there is three sectors in that, right? The first sector is cloud titans, because it's big enough. You just have to look at that number, individual of others. The second is enterprise and financials together, which is the other 36; and the third is specialty cloud and service providers together. So if you look at Q4, we believe all of the three sectors contributed strongly to the number.\nAnd if you look ahead, obviously, as Anshul has pointed out, the cloud titans are vital to our growth, but they're operating off a large base. So we should be able to grow faster in the other sectors and still carry a large number in cloud titans.\nJim Suva\nThank you for the details and congratulations.\nJayshree Ullal\nThank you so much.\nCharles Yager\nThanks, Jim.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.\nYour host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investors Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nThank you, Brandon, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nAs usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. This attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nGreat. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to the Q3 call. Joining me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Matt and I will provide management commentary on the slides that we posted last night and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.\nOur comments this morning will focus on providing a summary of the results for the quarter, an overview of economic and apartment fundamentals, and their impact on current portfolio performance, a review of investment and portfolio management activity where we were very active this past quarter. And finally, we'll share some progress on our Columbus Circle mixed-use development.\nStarting now on slide 4, our highlights for the quarter include the core FFO growth of 4.1%, which was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our Q3 outlook. You'll note that we've increased the midpoint of our full-year 2018 outlook by $0.03 to $9 per share.\nSame-store revenue growth came in at 2.3% and the same-store NOI growth was 3.1% for the quarter. The midpoint of the range for same-store performance, revenues, expenses and NOI, remain unchanged from our mid-year updated outlook. You'll note, however, we did provide additional ranges for a revised same-store basket that excludes the New York JV assets, assuming that deal closes prior to the end of the year as expected.\nWe completed $315 million in new development for the quarter at an average initial projected yield of 6.2% and have now completed $740 million at a 6.4% projected yield for the year. We also started two new communities totaling just over $200 million in Q3. And lastly, we raised $170 million of external capital through the sale of one community at an average cap rate of just under 4.5%.\nTurning now to slide 5 and an overview of fundamentals, I'll just go through this quickly. As all of you know, the U.S. economy is very healthy currently with the GDP growth running around 3.5%, corporate profits surging by double digits, labor markets one of the tightest we've seen so far this cycle, and the household wealth recently reaching record highs before the recent pullback in the equity markets.\nTurning to slide 6, the economy is being driven by both the business sector and the consumer. Strong business and consumer sentiment is translating into increased levels of capital investment and household formation, both of which are good signs for the economy in the housing market over the next few quarters.\nWhile these and most other leading indicators are still pointing up, there are some potential risks that are worth watching, including rising geopolitical tensions, the threat of trade wars, and the normalization of interest rates through continued Fed tightening. But, overall, it appears we'll have a solid macro environment in which to operate over the next few quarters.\nTurning to slide 7, this favorable macro environment is in turn supporting apartment fundamentals, which are showing signs of renewed strength with several drivers of rental demand turning up, including young-adult job growth, which is running above 2% again; wage growth reaching a cyclical high; and housing affordability actually hitting a cyclical low; all positive trends for apartment demand. These drivers are all further supported by demographics as the young-adult age cohort, or those under 34, is projected to experience decent growth for the next five years and not peak until 2024.\nTurning now to slide 8 in the supply side of the equation. It appears we're beginning to see some early signs of relief in supply, as both permits and starts have been declining in our markets for most of the year. In fact, over the last two quarters, on a seasonally adjusted basis, starts and permits are down by over 20% in the prior two quarters. This is probably mostly due to construction cost inflation that we've been talking about and it's been averaging in the high-single-digit range over the last year, with some regions like the Bay Area even reaching double-digit growth.\nWith rent growth generally averaging 2% to 3% over the last year, projected yields on prospective deals have deteriorated by 25 basis points to 50 basis points over the last year, so depending upon the market. It stands to reason then that this would begin to have an impact on new development investment, and that seems to be occurring in our markets and to some extent nationally.\nWe've also seen a pullback in the public markets as the apartment REIT sector's cut back on development underway by roughly 35% since year-end 2016. Of course, this recent pullback and start activity in 2018 won't be felt really in terms of deliveries until 2020 or late 2019 at the earliest, as we expect new deliveries to remain elevated over the next four quarters or so, as you can see in the box in the lower right in this chart.\nTurning now to slide 9, as you might expect, improving demand fundamentals are starting to translate into stronger portfolio performance. And indeed, this is happening. This chart depicts the four-quarter moving average in like-term rent change for our same-store portfolio.\nAs you can see, rent change has started to turn up \u2013 again, this is a four-quarter moving average \u2013 driven by improvement in Q2 and Q3, which posted stronger rent growth than the same quarters last year with Q3 average rent growth of 3.2% or 70 basis points greater than Q3 of last year. Similarly, growth potential for the same-store portfolio has started to turn up and in Q3 was at 2.3% or 60 basis points higher than Q3 of 2017 for the same-store portfolio.\nAnd turning to slide 10, most of our regions saw solid improvement in the quarter. Northern California saw the biggest bounce with rent growth of 4%, which was 250 basis points higher than Q3 of last year. All three East Coast regions saw good improvement in the 50 basis points to 100 basis points range. Southern California saw modest deceleration and Seattle more significant deceleration from the prior year. Q3 rent growth in both of those regions, however, was still at or above the portfolio average of 3.2%.\nThese trends have largely continued into Q4 with like-term rents up by about 3% in October. In addition, rent growth is broad-based with every region currently in the 2.5% to 4% range, and the East and West performing roughly in line with one another for the first time since 2011.\nI'll now turn it over to Matt, who will discuss investment and portfolio management activities past quarter. Matt?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nAll right. Thanks, Tim. Turning first to our current development activity. As you can see on slide 11, our completions this year have continued to meet our initial underwriting and deliver very healthy value creation with yields of 6.4% compared to estimated cap rates for those same assets of roughly 4.5%. In addition, our development portfolio is generating lease-up NOI as expected, contributing to earnings in 2018 right in line with our initial guidance.\nThis quarter we completed Avalon Dogpatch, our largest development completion of the year. This wood frame community which is uniquely positioned in an emerging neighborhood of San Francisco that offers mainly high-rise product was delivered at a very compelling basis, which in turn contributes to its 6.2% yield, a remarkable result for the Bay Area.\nTurning to slide 12, we have an excellent long-term track record of delivering new communities in accordance with our initial budgets. This is in large part due to us acting as our own general contractor in most cases and having a majority of our trade costs locked in at the time we start a new project. This is particularly important given the increasing cost base in our industry.\nAs Tim indicated, construction inflation is running well ahead of rent increases, a particularly acute issue in the tech markets on the West Coast. This quarter, we did recognize cost increases on two wood frame projects currently under construction in the East Bay in Emeryville and Walnut Creek. These budget increases, which collectively total approximately $40 million or 15% of our original estimate for those two projects, were the result of unexpected union pressures and subcontractor performance issues.\nThese two projects are exceptions to the general trend which continues to reflect excellent construction execution. And across our current overall development portfolio, even including these two communities, our actual costs are tracking within 1.6% of the original budget as shown on the slide.\nTurning to slide 13, our sector-leading development platform continues to provide excellent risk-adjusted returns with approximately $3 billion in value creation so far this cycle and another $800 million expected from the development currently underway. While new starts may be less profitable than early cycle deals due to the cost pressures just mentioned, we are confident that long-term returns will still be highly accretive, consistent with our track record as shown in the chart in the upper left. And we continue to manage capital markets risk by match-funding our development activity as shown in the lower right.\nTurning to slide 14, our transactions team has had a productive year. As we executed on our strategy to rotate capital into our expansion markets of Denver and Southeast Florida, we are on track to complete the acquisition of four communities before year-end, including two suburban garden properties in the Denver area, the high-rise in downtown West Palm Beach and a garden community in the Baltimore-Washington Corridor just north of BWI Airport and the NSA headquarters at Fort Meade.\nWe've been opportunistically funding both our acquisition and development activity primarily through the transaction market, as shown in the table on the left-hand side of the slide. We will have sold over $1.2 billion in wholly-owned assets by year-end, which after netting out $335 million in planned acquisitions leaves us as net sellers of roughly $895 million during the course of the year, providing cost-effective capital to fund our external investment activity.\nTo provide a little bit more detail on the Manhattan JV transaction, as we announced earlier this month and as shown on slide 15, we are selling an 80% interest in five stabilized properties valued at $760 million on a gross basis. As we've indicated for the past several years, our allocation to the Greater New York region is a bit higher than we would like and this imbalance would otherwise be trending even higher due to the development pipeline we have in the region.\nWe have sold about $1.1 billion in suburban New York assets over the last four years, but have not sold any wholly-owned properties in New York City itself until now. This transaction further reduces our allocation to the Greater New York region, while preserving our brand presence and rebalances our allocation within the region to roughly $130 million (13:06) each in the city, the New Jersey suburbs, and suburban New York including Long Island and Westchester.\nIt is important to note that while these are among the most highly valued assets in our portfolio, there is a material difference between the short-term earnings yield or initial investment return and the transaction cap rate as that term is defined by various market participants. This is due to the presence of property tax abatements on all five assets and a ground lease structure on two of the assets, which provide a short-term boost to cash flow until their expirations and/or resets.\nConsequently, the unlevered earnings yield on the assets is in the low-5% range. But this yield is roughly 150 basis points higher than what might be considered a normalized cap rate after adjusting for these factors.\nThe impact of the JV transaction on our portfolio can be seen on slide 16. Metro New York share of our total NOI will drop from 24% to 22%, closer to our long-term target of 20%.\nMoving to slide 17, I'd like to provide an update on our Columbus Circle development. This asset includes approximately 67,000 square feet of prime retail space on Broadway and 172 residential units, and is on track for completion next year.\nTurning first to the retail component of the project, this slide shows our leasing progress to-date. We are pleased to report that we have executed a 35,000-square-foot lease for the two below-grade floors and a main entrance on Broadway to Target. In addition, we are in advanced negotiations to lease just under half of the second floor space as well. These two tenants will bring us to 65% leased by square footage and 45% leased by revenue, and both are at economics at or better than our initial underwriting. We expect to turn over both spaces for TI work to these tenants in early 2019.\nAs to the residential component, we are currently exploring a shift from rental apartments to for-sale condominiums. From the beginning, one of the most appealing aspects of this project, apart from its absolutely AAA location, has been the flexibility it provides with no tax abatements, zoning restrictions, or affordable component that would impede a condominium strategy if it offer a better return profile.\nWhile the Manhattan condo market has softened somewhat over the last year, as shown in the lower left corner of slide 18, our building offers some compelling advantages as indicated in the upper-right-hand side of the slide. Our average unit size of roughly 1,100 square feet, while large for a Manhattan rental building, would actually be on the smaller side for a condominium offering, which in turn allows for lower whole-dollar pricing than most other new product on the market.\nAs a result, 85% of our homes would be priced below $5 million at our initial projected target pricing with a wide variety of price points depending on unit size and location in the building, averaging roughly $3.2 million to $3.5 million per home.\nAnd between the 8-foot deep (15:54) facing Broadway and the balconies on the other frontages, more than 40% of the units have private outdoor space, an extreme rarity for such a prime Manhattan address. The outdoor space is not included in the average unit size, providing even greater value to potential buyers.\nWe're still studying this option in greater detail, but our economic analysis suggests that at current market pricing, there could be more than $150 million in additional pre-tax value through a condo execution. To maximize our optionality, we are proceeding with some modest upgrades to the finishes in the building, which we believe would have value under either scenario and which will increase the expected total capital cost by less than 5%.\nIf we decide to proceed with the condo execution, we would open for sales in March or April of next year, establish a threshold level of minimum sales contracts which we would require before finalizing the condo regime and proceeding the first settlement. Of course, we will continue to keep you apprised of our progress and our thinking on this as it evolves.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Tim.\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nThanks, Matt. So, in summary, a healthy U.S. economy is supporting stronger apartment market fundamentals in most of our regions, with same-store rent change improving over the last two quarters and so far in Q4. Development activities generally tracking expectations in terms of lease-up and yield performance, although we are experiencing some cost challenges in certain markets, as Matt mentioned.\nWe continue to make progress on our portfolio management objectives through activity in the transaction and joint venture market. And lastly, as Matt just mentioned, we're making really solid strides in retail leasing at our Columbus Circle mixed-use development where we're also evaluating a condo execution on the residential component. And we'll certainly continue to share our thinking with that as we explore this opportunity further over the next couple of quarters.\nSo, with that, Brandon, we'll be happy to open the call for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. The first question will come from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nNicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nThanks. On Columbus Circle, when do you need to make a final decision on condo execution versus rental?\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Matt, why don't you walk Nick through kind of the timeline there?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nSure. Yeah. So, Nick, what we're thinking is that we would start some early pre-marketing shortly in the next month or two, just to start building a prospect list. And then, if we're feeling comfortable with it, we would open a sales center onsite probably in March.\nOne of the things we have to offer that most other new condos don't is that we would have the product to actually show. So we think by March or April, we'll have a floor in the tower with four different unit types complete and kind of white-glove-ready as it were, which would provide \u2013 so we're not thinking pre-sales before we actually have product to show.\nBut if we open on that schedule, we'd open in kind of March, April. And then if we were going to do that, we would just see how it goes. We would establish internally a minimum threshold percentage of units that we would want to have under contract before we locked-in. And that might take anywhere from two to four months, depending on how sales go.\nBut it wouldn't be until after we reach that threshold, whatever it would be 30%, 40%, 50%, whatever we want, that we would then actually record the condo and start settlement. So we would have optionality all the way up until that point.\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah, Nick. And maybe just to add to that, it's probably obvious, but the opportunity costs would be potentially some lost lease-up revenue over the two to three or four months that Matt mentioned, as we're seeing the kind of traction that a condo execution would get, so.\nNicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nMakes sense. And if settlements do begin in the back half of next year, what do you underwrite in, in terms of timing for a total sell-out?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nTo some extent, that's going to be a function of pricing and that gets into some of our tactics and strategy. I don't think we're really at a point where we want to throw a target out there yet at this point for that.\nNicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nThanks. And just, finally, given the progress made on the retail we've seen, what are the longer-term plans for the retail? And will you look to sell it once it's leased or are you comfortable owning and operating longer-term?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Hey, Nick. It's Matt again. I think we would probably expect to complete the lease-up of the retail space in the next year or two, and then we'll look and we'll see. Hopefully, there'll be good NOI stream in place. But we may well turn around and decide to sell that in a couple of years because obviously it is a large retail asset and that's not our core business. But to get maximum execution on that, to go ahead and lease it up, and then we'll kind of see what it feels like at that time.\nNicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nThanks.\nOperator\nThank you for the question. The next question will come from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.\nRich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI\nHey. Good morning, everybody. Maybe just to quickly follow-up on the Columbus Circle retail question there. Can you give us a sense of just how competitive the leasing process was for the space that Target took down and then also what is currently being offered to the market there?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nSure, Rich. It's Matt. I can speak to that a little bit again. There's been a lot of interest from a lot of different categories and for all different kinds of space. We have three very different priced spaces. We have the subgrade space, we have the Broadway frontage ground-level space, and then we have the second floor space. So, at this point, all the subgrade space, a little bit of the ground floor just for the entry for Target and the entry for the second floor tenant and about half of the second floor is spoken for. So, what we're left with, it's still available, would be probably 85% of the ground floor and a little more than half of the second floor.\nAnd we continue to see \u2013 it's different categories of users. Obviously, those are different rent levels, so they're different kind of tenants. So we've had pretty good interest from a wide variety of tenants for the space Target took. We've had a reasonable amount of interest on the second floor. The ground floor space is the most expensive space and probably the space that \u2013 the thought was we needed to get the anchor tenant set first and that would generate more traction there. We are talking to folks, but we always expected that to probably be the last space to lease. So we're kind of not surprised with where that sits today.\nRich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI\nAll right. Thanks for the color there. And then my second question, I appreciate the detail in the earnings release surrounding the New York City JV portfolio impact on same-store results for 2018. Can you help us understand, I guess, in rough terms what the impact on 2019 same-store would be from those assets being excluded from the portfolio?\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Rich, this is Sean. And to the extent that we complete the execution of the JV, whether it's December or January, those assets would be removed from same-store. So there would not be an impact on same-store per se. It would be removed for both periods for both 2018 and 2019 in terms of the calculation of the same-store metrics for the calendar year 2019, if that's your specific question.\nThe issues that led to the potential change in guidance as a result of the closing of the JV relate to two specific issues. One is the ground lease that we disclosed previously that we acquired; the fee for Morningside Park last December, that's about $2.3 million. And then, there is another roughly $700,000 that relates to the write-off of a retail leased from third quarter of last year. So those are obviously a tailwind as it relates to the 2018 same-store results, particularly on operating expenses, and there was an impact on NOI.\nSo, that's why it was necessary to basically indicate what the impact on the same-store performance would be by changing the composition of the bucket with and without the New York JV assets.\nRich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI\nYeah. I guess...\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nBut just...\nRich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI\nOh, go ahead. Sorry.\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nAside from those two factors, the impact was negligible to the overall same-store.\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. We're pretty much tracking where we thought we'd be in terms of all the same-store metrics, except for the impact of the New York transaction.\nRich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI\nOkay. Yeah. And I guess to be clear, I mean, obviously the pool will change in terms of the calculation next year. But I guess my question would be, let's assume they were in the pool for all of 2019 and then we compare that number to what the pool without them in 2019 would be, just to get a sense of growth across the rest of the portfolio, if that helps frame it a little better.\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. I mean, we're not ready to talk about 2019 in detail just yet. But certainly New York is a market that we'd be talking about that there's a fair amount of supply this year. The supply starts to fall off somewhat next year. So you might see some marginal improvement there. But we haven't run through all the metrics in terms of the calculation of what we expect from New York and those assets in 2019 yet to be able to give you enough insight into what the impact would have been if we didn't sell them and they remained in the same-store.\nRich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI\nGot it. Okay. Thank you.\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you for the question. The next question will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Yulico - Scotia Capital, Inc.\nThank you. So, your forecast for supply in 2019 is a little bit higher than this year. Could you break that down, the impact among some of your major markets where you see supply getting tougher or easier?\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah, Nick, this is Sean. Happy to address that maybe at a sort of regional level and then insight on a few markets. But as it relates to 2019, in terms of what we expect relative to 2018, we do see supply drifting down a bit in New England, primarily in Boston, up a little bit around 30 basis points in the mid-Atlantic, and then up about 80 basis points in Northern California.\nAnd if you look at the markets where there's some meaningful change to really talk about in terms of increases in supply in 2019 relative to 2018, D.C. is about 3,500 units and then the East Bay and San Jos\u00e9 are each about 2,400 units in 2019 and beyond what they projected to deliver in 2018.\nIn terms of meaningful declines, what we can see for sure, Boston about 1,100 units, Baltimore about 2,000, Orange County about 1,200, about 2,000 in San Diego. We do expect to see a decline in New York City, but given the nature of the construction and delivery cycle there, there's some question as to what's going to be delayed moving into next year. So we expect some modest reduction there, probably not what would have been anticipated mid-year when we saw it at that point, which is more meaningful, but we'll be scrubbing that pipeline later in the fourth quarter to provide good solid updates when we get into the January call.\nNicholas Yulico - Scotia Capital, Inc.\nOkay. That's helpful. And then going back to the potential condo sales now in New York, I get that the overall NAV impact may be higher, or the NAV benefit may be higher. But how do you weigh that versus taxes you'd have to pay on sales of units, economic risk for selling units rather than leasing them and, lastly, how this all sort of plays into FFO? And I'd say it feels like investors have kind of discredited condo sales income in FFO historically for REITs. So, how do you kind of weigh all that?\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Nick, Tim here. First of all, as an investment, when we first got into this, we had a sense that maybe condo may be the highest and best use, just given the fact there's no affordables here, just the outstanding location. We programmed the community to give us some optionality. While the units are smaller than a typical condominium, they're larger than the typical rental. So we'd always sort of programmed this to provide some optionality.\nAs we got further into construction and we saw what the potential differential was between a rental value, capital highs and condominium, we just thought we owed it to ourselves as a good capital steward to explore further. And, as Matt mentioned, we think the differential may be about $150 million on a pre-tax basis. So, even if you calculate some tax in there, so that's probably still talking about a nine-figure differential. And we think that we owe it to ourselves to explore that.\nAnd just the fact that this building is going to be ready for occupancy sometime next year, it is a unique advantage in that we have existing units that we can sell, whereas a lot of condos that are on the market today are on a pre-sale basis that are well beyond that kind of time period in which they can deliver.\nSo the cost here, the opportunity cost is a little bit of upgrades that we think we can capture value on the rental side as well. But it's really sort of foregone lease-up NOI for a few months. If we decide that demand just isn't there at the kind of values that we thought, we can always turn the lease-up on this thing in really a couple weeks.\nSo I think the risk profile, this is maybe a little different than somebody who's thinking about this from ground-up perspective. Renting is our base business, and so if that's the fallback, we don't really see where the extra risk is. And we'll probably ultimately will require a higher pre-sale requirement before making the condominium effective than maybe somebody who is building a condominium purpose-built from the beginning.\nSo, hopefully, that's responsive to the questions. It's something we've been thinking a lot in terms of how to just risk-manage this opportunity. And as Matt laid out in his schedule, we think we've done that. And as we said, we'll continue to keep both the analysts and investment community very well informed as to how we're seeing the market and how it's playing out.\nNicholas Yulico - Scotia Capital, Inc.\nOkay. Appreciate that. Thanks, Tim.\nOperator\nThank you for the question. The next question will come from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJuan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nHi. Just a question on the strength or lack thereof of seasonality this year. Have you seen any benefits from an elongated seasonal lease-up period that may act as a headwind as we think about 2019 versus 2018?\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nJuan, this is Sean. Not really. I mean, things are pretty much falling within a traditional cycle for us in terms of seasonality. So I don't think there's any material impact if you look at it. I mean, there was some discussion around that topic a couple of years ago as it relates to some specific markets and what was happening and a shortened durations to the leasing season, but nothing unusual in terms of what we're seeing this year that would bleed into 2019.\nJuan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nAnd just going back to Nick's question about developments and kind of the earnings impact from an FFO perspective, I guess is there any development \u2013 or should we think about any risk to FFO on developments coming online for 2019 kind of with and without going condo on the Upper West Side project?\nKevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nJuan, this is Kevin. The only development that really is relevant here would be on the Circle. And as Tim alluded to, there would be as a consequence of pursuing a condo strategy, if we go that route, a couple of impacts as we've discussed. We wouldn't have the lease-up NOI, you'd have capitalized interest ceasing as it would for a rental but it would be stopped once those units were made available, and then probably be some marketing costs associated with the pursuit of a condo strategy that would probably be carved out of core FFO.\nSo those are probably the two big things, the fact that there might be condo gains that would be carved out of core FFO, marketing costs would be carved out of core FFO. And then I guess the third thing is lease-up NOI that wouldn't be present on the residential piece. There may be one or two other things, but those are the main things.\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nAnd when we give our outlook in January 1, we'll be explicit as to what our underlying assumptions are with respect to Columbus Circle and lease-up income as we have this year.\nKevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah.\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nJuan, just one other thing to add to that. I'm not sure if you were referring to this or not, but there was some discussion as we moved into 2018 that our deliveries in 2018 would be down a fair bit relative to 2017. As we move into 2019, we do expect deliveries to come back up to levels that are more consistent with what we saw in 2017. Obviously, you have to set aside the Columbus Circle which would have different use, but you'd start to see more deliveries coming through which would obviously look different to us in terms of earnings impact in 2019 versus 2018.\nJuan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nOkay. Great. And do you guys mind giving the portfolio-wide new and renewals for the third quarter and what you're setting out the fourth quarter numbers at for renewals?\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. In terms of portfolio-wide numbers as opposed to individual markets, I mean, as Tim alluded to in terms of October, we're running around 3% in terms of blended rent change for the entire portfolio. And then if you're looking at offers, offers are sort of in the mid-6% range for November and December.\nJuan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nOkay. Thank you.\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYes.\nOperator\nThank you for the question. The next question will come from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. This is really the first quarter we've seen turnover increase in some time, and I'm just curious if this was necessarily by design or just a function on the higher rents on renewals starting to force tenants out? And then, did you see any notable increase, I guess, in the regions for move-out?\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah, Austin. This is Sean. What you're seeing is a little bit of an anomaly. We had more expirations in the third quarter of this year relative to the third quarter of last year. So, if you look at it, turnover as a percentage of expirations, it was actually down about 220 basis points, pretty consistent with what we've seen through most of this year in terms of reduced turnover. But there is a change to the expiration profile that moves the numbers a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. So, in general, the trend has been down in terms of reduced turnover, and that remains the case.\nSo, in terms of reasons for move-out, there's no material changes whatsoever in terms of what we've seen this year relative to last year. It's been pretty consistent.\nAustin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.\nGreat. Thanks for the clarification. And then, as you evaluated the New York City joint venture, I mean, did you consider including any assets in the outer boroughs, I guess, considering that's where it seems like a significant portion of the new supply is being delivered over the next several quarters?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Hey, Austin. It's Matt. We didn't. Actually the portfolio that we brought to the market was all Manhattan assets and it was all stabilized assets. And that was by design that for the types of capital we were looking to partner with and selling a partial interest sale, we wanted a portfolio that had a fair amount of consistency to it. And so we were advised by the folks who were working with on it, and I think appropriately, that the more consistent the portfolio could be the better. And for many capital sources, there's still obviously deep, deep institutional demand in the boroughs as well, but that would be kind of the thing that would get the most attention from the capital that we were targeting.\nAustin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question.\nOperator\nThank you for the question. The next question will come from Drew Babin with Baird. Please go ahead.\nDrew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\nHey. Good morning. A question on New Jersey. It looked like revenue growth year-over-year decelerated a bit in 3Q relative to 2Q. And I was just wondering with a decent amount of supply looking to come to North Jersey next year, is that a market that you expect to maybe be a bit softer going forward? And I guess can you talk about Northern Jersey versus some of the properties you have in Central Jersey and what's going on there?\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Drew, this is Sean. Happy to chat about that. In terms of Northern New Jersey, we don't have a significant portfolio there. And I'd say what's probably most exposed in this supply, as it normally is, is our Jersey City asset. Yeah, there's a fair amount on the Gold Coast being done, but we don't have a big presence there other than potential impacts on Jersey City. So you will see some impact there.\nAnd the rest of the assets in Bergen County are generally, at this point, in terms of the nature of how they perform, they tend to be not super high data assets is the way I'd describe them. So they're not right along the Gold Coast in terms of sensitivity to new supply. So they tend to just chug along and perform quite well, same thing with the Central Jersey assets for the most part.\nSo they don't present a lot of volatility, but they tend to be stable environments like this where there's a lot of supply at the high end, whether it's in the city or on the Gold Coast in Northern New Jersey. So we'll provide better insight into it in terms of the supply as we get into next year, but it's a pretty stable book of business overall. It kind of runs like Long Island in terms of performing pretty well without a lot of volatility.\nDrew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\nAnd I guess a related question as you kind of rotate around New York City, the Fairfield-New Haven market, it's not in the New York metro disclosures, doesn't really grow like Boston but also not a lot of new supply. I guess, how should we think about that market long-term? And is there potentially a point where that might make sense for harvesting some capital?\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. I'm happy to comment on that and then Matt can as well. We certainly have been a net seller in the Greater Fairfield market over the last few years. And based on what we're seeing overall in terms of demand drivers in that environment, independent of supply, we probably will likely to be a net seller.\nBut, again, that market tends to perform just like the other ones that I mentioned, tends to run \u2013 I mean, we're talking about 2% year-over-year kind of numbers right now. It tends to hold between, I'd say, 1.5% and 2.5% historically in terms of revenue growth if you look at it over a longer period of time. But to the extent that we find opportunity to sell some of those assets, some of which are uniquely positioned potentially as for-sale assets or others or other uses as rental, we will certainly consider that.\nDrew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\nOkay.\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Drew, this is Matt. I'll just add to that a little bit. We do think of Fairfield and New Haven, they're actually two separate MSAs. So we're pretty much out of New Haven at this point. We sold Milford last year, which I think was our last asset in the New Haven MSA. But of what we have left in Fairfield, a lot of it is much further kind of down county, closer to New York City with better train connectivity. But there are still probably a few assets that are a little more far-flung that we are likely to sell there in the next couple years.\nDrew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\nThat helps. And then lastly, a question for Kevin on the balance sheet. Seeing property yield on sales obviously down in the mid-4x range, as 30-year debt sort of in the mid-4x range, is there a certain point where if that costs begin to creep up more that you might considered even lower leverage model if the economics between selling properties and secured bonds, if the difference, at least in the short-term, kind of equals out? Is that something that might be explored or should we continue to think about roughly 5x net debt-to-EBITDA sort of the lower bound to the leverage target?\nKevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nDrew, it's Kevin. Yeah. I think for now probably thinking about our leverage target in the low 5x net debt-to-EBITDA turn level seems to make sense. Certainly, we're tracking where capital costs are today and we have been able to sell some attractively priced assets to help support our investment activity. But I think we're pretty comfortable with where our leverage is right now.\nDrew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\nGreat. That's really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you for the question. The next question will come from Richard Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nRonald Kamdem - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nThis is Ronald Kamdem on for Richard Hill. Just two quick ones from me. Just looking at the projected long-term goals in terms of New York, and given that that's going to be one where you continue to sell, just curious between New York City, New Jersey, New York suburban, do you guys have a sense of where some of the low-hanging fruits are? Are there going to be more sales in New York City, is it Jersey or is it sort of all around?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah, sure, Ronald. This is Matt. As I've mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had been selling more in the suburbs than the cities, but this is really the first time we've sold wholly-owned asset in the city this cycle. And I think the balance right now, which is roughly a third, a third, a third, feels pretty good. So, we may lighten up a bit more in the New York metro area.\nBut I would look for kind of those proportions to the extent we do. Central Jersey, we might be a little heavy still because we have a lot of development actually coming in Central Jersey. So it might be a little bit more weighted that direction. But we're trying to keep the same rough proportion.\nRonald Kamdem - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nGot it. And the other one, I was just \u2013 it was interesting when you mentioned the two communities in Northern California where those construction costs increased and so forth. One, is there any other markets where you're seeing that sort of pressure? And two, can you just talk about maybe some of the long-term benefits in terms of reducing supplies to those areas?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah, it's interesting. The flip side of the pain, right?\nRonald Kamdem - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nRight.\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nCertainly, in terms of hard cost pressure, Northern California would be the most extreme right now. Frankly, Denver is also seeing quite a lot of it. We're not building anything in Denver, but that is one thing that's informed our approach to partnering with others and frankly lay off some of that risk to partners, and through potential kind of capital JV-type structures that we've been looking at, similar to what we're doing in Southeast Florida with TCR in Doral.\nSo, Seattle has seen quite a bit of pressure. I think it has, for whatever reason, a little bit of a deeper labor market and subcontractor base. So, while it's seen also a great ramp-up in supply, it hasn't responded quite as aggressively as Northern Cal, but that would be the other region where we're seeing still very strong hard cost growth.\nThe impact on supply, we'll see. I think, as Tim mentioned, we're starting to see it in the start numbers in our markets in general, perhaps more so in Northern Cal. I'd tell you, on the development side, we haven't signed up a new third-party development right in Northern Cal in years. What we are focused on is entitlements where we begin to flying (44:06) in our own portfolio and we had a couple of great opportunities there and/or public-private partnerships, like the deal we have with the city at Balboa Reservoir.\nSo we've certainly seen it in our behavior. And you would think at some point it would start to impact starts there. Again, we're seeing it across our portfolio. I don't know that it's disproportionately to Northern Cal right now though.\nRonald Kamdem - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nHelpful. Thank you. That's all I got.\nOperator\nThank you for the question. The next question will come from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. First one, just going back to Columbus Circle, I just want to make sure I understood the catalysts more near-term. When you have the flexibility over time to think about condo versus rental I think since the transaction was initially announced, the for-sale market probably has gotten softer. And then you've got tax reform on top of that kind of creates some additional risk on the ownership side.\nSo, just wondering, is there something that happened more recently or something as you think about the rental assumptions that would have tilted this towards condo?\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nDennis, maybe I'll start and let Matt jump in if you like. I think the one thing that maybe we underestimated was the value of selling a new condominium versus a conversion. So, just from a pure value and execution standpoint, we probably underestimated that as we thought about kind of what our options when we made the investment in the first place. So, that's informed our view a bit in terms of exploring it now rather than saying let's just lease it up and explore it when the market is white hot. So, that's probably been the biggest factor.\nFrom a rental standpoint, the market has been pretty flat to slightly up, I think Sean mentioned. So, that really hasn't changed in terms of our view of the rental economics at least on the revenue side.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC\nOkay. And then, as you think about just the backdrop of the market, you noted a couple of stats there on the slide there about contract activity being down and pricing incentives being up. What would you be assuming over the next 18, 24 months as far as the backdrop of the market? Are you just kind of holding that steady as far as the competitive nature?\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nWell, I guess the way we're thinking about it is we're going to go into this pre-marketing period and see how strong the market is and let the market tell us. And so, to the extent we get a great response there through the brokerage community, the brokerage network, we think we can start converting some of those prospects to contract within that sort of the second milestone to actually try to start building contracts.\nAnd again, we have sort of a second opportunity to decide whether we want to move forward or not based upon the strength of the market. And again, we don't have to be committed to this route. If the weakness just is stronger than we think, then we always have the ability to lease these units up and essentially cancel any deals that we may have had in the market.\nSo we think we've got a couple sort of milestones here that we can sort of test the depth of the market. And if it's there, we'll go. If it's not, we'll go back to sort of plan A.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC\nOkay. That's helpful. And then, just one last question on the supply outlook. Today you're looking for relatively stable deliveries in your markets 2018 versus 2017, and then 2019 to be up a little bit. If we go back to earlier in the year, I think 2018 was going to be up more and 2019 would have been a fairly sizable drop.\nCan you just maybe explain kind of the shifting between the years? How much of this is a net-net increase if you look at 2018 and 2019 together, versus just maybe delay from some of the competitive supply?\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. I think \u2013 Dennis, it's Sean. When we talked about it earlier in the year, I think what we said is that we expected some mild reduction probably in 2019. But given what we've seen historically, to the extent that we see more delays than what has been normal the last two or three years, those numbers could even out. And based on what we see today, that appears to be happening. So the same assets are under construction and what's actually getting delivered in 2019 is increasing as a result of some movement from 2018.\nSo, as I said earlier in response to one of the questions, we'll be scrubbing the pipeline hard here in Q4 before we finalize our guidance for 2019, and be able to provide a good update at that point. But to be honest, just based on where we are in the cycle for construction and the labor availability, you can say that 2019 number, you expect that probably to come down some as you move through 2019. It's just hard to get visibility on exactly where it's going to be and how much.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC\nBut net-net, as you sit here today, is that collective 2018, 2019 in your markets higher today than earlier in the year or just distributed differently?\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nDistributed differently based on what we know.\nDennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC\nOkay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYes.\nOperator\nThank you for the question. The next question will come from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)\nAs a nearby resident, thanks for bringing Target to the neighborhood. On your developments, with the pullback in starts among your competitors, is your strategy now to increase your pipeline going forward or elevated costs kind of keeping you at current levels?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. John, it's Matt. I mean, our pipeline is driven by two things: Bottom-up, where are the opportunities, where are we seeing the opportunities, and are we getting appropriate risk-adjusted returns based on our underwriting. And then a little bit top-down, as we've talked about a couple quarters ago, kind of what can our balance sheet support in a leverage-neutral manner in terms of funding.\nSo, right now, I would say the bottom-up constraint is probably at least as significant as the top-down constraint. So we don't look at it and say, well, if the other publics are developing less, we should be developing less or more. We really look at it in terms of what deals are there out there that are underwriting that are providing us reasonable returns, and there are few of those. We've only signed up three new development rights all year this year. Interestingly, three in this past quarter, but those were the first three for the year. And one of those is a joint venture on a mall site with GGP/Brookfield, so that's the deal we've been working on for a long time. One of them was a densification of an existing asset that we already owned, kind of like what I mentioned earlier, in Seattle, taking that strategy from Northern Cal to Seattle. We're looking at maybe an opportunity in Southern Cal now to do the same. So it's more of that kind of business.\nSo I think it's more a reflection of the reality that where hard costs are, it's harder to find deals that work. The ones that do, tend to be more in the suburban and in the Northeast. You look at, for example, we just started a deal this quarter in Old Bridge, New Jersey. That's a deal we've had under contract for four or five years. A market that doesn't see a lot of volatility, has seen less pressure on hard costs and still has a very strong yield.\nI think, Tim, you wanted to add?\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. John, just to put some numbers to it. I think we talked about this this last quarter. If you looked at the 2013 to 2016 period, we probably averaged somewhere around $1.3 billion in starts. And it was our expectation in 2017, 2018, and 2019 that was probably going to be down kind of commensurate with what I said, the overall REIT sector is down by about 35%, 40%, more in the $800 million, maybe $900 million range. And that's kind of consistent with kind of the market opportunity that we've seen as well, as Matt was mentioning in his remarks.\nSo, that's kind of where we see it, at least for the foreseeable future, all subject to kind of what the economics actually look like at the time which we have to actually make the capital allocation decision.\nJohn Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)\nAnd is the 6.4% yield that you've had on completions year-to-date, is that representative of your overall pipeline at Columbus Circle or when you're underwriting for new projects?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nThe development rates that haven't yet started, the basket as a whole is probably in the low-6s, so it's probably just a little bit under that. But it varies a lot based on where you are in terms of geography and product type.\nJohn Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)\nOkay. And just one quick one on Columbus Circle. The local press is referring to the building as 1865 Broadway. Is the retail basically being rebranded or branded differently than the residential?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nNo, I mean, the residential address is actually 15 West 61st Street. Whether rental or condo, that's where the front door to the residential is. It's obviously not on Broadway, which is the prime, most viable retail space. And the retail address is probably a Broadway address. There may be a second floor tenant who technically has a 61st Street address as well, but the retail engages with Broadway, the residential really engages with the side street.\nJohn Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)\nGot it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you for the question. The next question will come from John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJohn William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGreat. Thank you. A bit of an oversimplification, but on the condo conversion, looks like, let's say, $110 million profit after tax, 172 units, about $650,000 in additional value created after tax. What happens to the retail we're assuming that you get out of that? Can you make any money on the retail or would the retail offset the value created on a condo?\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nJohn, we don't expect to lose money per se on the retail. As Matt mentioned, it's not our core business area, so we're probably a little less confident in our projections here. But based upon our pro forma and the kind of rents that we're currently renting at, we think it probably contributes modestly to the profitability of this project.\nJohn William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGreat. And then a second question. What's your crystal ball look like for hard costs over the next two or three years, assuming the economy remains reasonably healthy? Is it the north of 5% annual increases or more inflation-esque at 2% to 3%?\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. No, it's a great question, John. When you're kind of in the middle of seeing these really healthy single digits, you kind of ask yourself what's going to change to sort of change that outcome. We are seeing a drop in starts in our markets. So, that's the first sort of canary in a coal mine where it might actually see some relief on pricing. You are starting to see the builders reporting order volumes being down, so that might help a little bit. But we're at full employment and we're not replacing some of the skilled labor we have in the construction trades. And so, this is maybe both a secular issue and a cyclical issue.\nSo I don't think we're \u2013 we're not betting that it's going to be 2% or 3% or in line with rents, and it's one of the reasons why we're trying to maintain as much optionality on the development of that portfolio as we can. So we also laid it out. Until there's some kind of correction or, ultimately, if we need to write off some of these deals, we will if we just see them as uneconomic.\nJohn William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nLast question, any effect on land prices or land prices are sort of remaining sticky?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. I think it's still too early. John, this is Matt again. We do get that question seems like every quarter. We're waiting. But land prices are sticky. I would say, for the most part, they probably stopped going up. And there are deals that aren't trading. There are land deals that aren't trading. So, in terms of maybe getting a little more favorable, people don't always expect to put it under contract today and close tomorrow. But we haven't seen any material decline in land prices that would make up for the increase in hard costs yet.\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. The thing to remember, John, is land costs are generally 15% to 20% of total capital costs; whereas, construction is probably 65%, maybe as high as 70%, and soft costs maybe another 15%. So, land costs will have to come down a lot to make up for the kind of appreciation and escalation we're seeing on the construction side.\nJohn William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you for your question. The next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\nHey. Good morning down there. Two questions. First, as far as the condo and the retail at Columbus Circle, are those now both in, like, a TRS? Or as far as the retail goes, is there some sort of holding period that you need to maintain to allow that to be good REIT income versus having it be taxable?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Alex, they actually are both in TRSs.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\nOkay. That's easy. And then the second question is, just as far as New York State goes, with the rent control coming up for renewal next year and the possible change in the Senate and Albany composition, is there any concern that if they change the rent control laws that that would impact your affordable units that are part of your 421-a or those are separate from any legislation changes they may consider?\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Alex, this is Sean. A good question with a whole lot of speculation around it. And whether the impact would be on affordable homes specifically or more of the market rate homes that are subject to rent stabilization because of the 421-a program, I suspect anything that would be related to the 421-a program, given the fact it's already occurred over that, would probably be very difficult to get through. And that's what would impact potentially our portfolio.\nIt wouldn't impact it in a meaningful way. There's only about 7% of the units in the portfolio that are basically at legal caps at this point in terms of the rents that are allowed. So the impact wouldn't be material. But I wouldn't suspect that that would happen, given everything we've been through on the 421-a program over the last few years in New York.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\nOkay. But if they change and do away with vacancy decontrol, you don't think that that would impact you or that could impact you?\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nIt depends on what they're talking about in terms of the population of units that would be impacted by any change, whether it's affordable units or just the stabilized units, because you're into these different programs in New York that you have to work through. So I'd be surprised if it was on the market rate units that are subject to stabilization because of 421-a, as opposed to technically affordable units that are set aside that are different.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\nOkay.\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nSo there's a lot of speculation around this, but there's nothing substantial that's actually being drafted or negotiated. So I think we'd likely be okay, but even if something came through that affected the piece that we'd be worried about, it wouldn't be a material impact on the assets.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\nOkay. Thank you, Sean.\nSean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYes.\nOperator\nThank you for your question. The next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC\nThanks. On Columbus Circle, if you had kept it or if you do keep it for rental, what was the unlevered IRR expectation over the long-term for this site?\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nHi, John. We typically don't provide disclosure on projected long-term IRRs, but I think we gave a sense that we thought the economics here on a development basis were in the mid-4% range, including the retail. So you'd have to sort of kind of \u2013 you can probably input your own assumptions there in terms of growth and reversion at cap rates, as to what that would translate into an unlevered IRR.\nJohn Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC\nYeah. Understood. Could you share the contracted retail rents per foot and what's under negotiation? How does that compare, how will it compare to initial underwriting?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Hey, John. It's Matt. Yeah. We're not going to disclose what the actual rents were in the lease. But as I did mention, the two deals that we have either signed or very close to being signed are both at or better than the economics we had underwritten both in terms of rent and also in terms of TIs and free rent. So, so far, we're tracking a little ahead of our program. Obviously, we still have a lot of space left to lease.\nJohn Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC\nOkay. That helps. Thanks a lot.\nOperator\nThank you for the question. The final question will come from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nYeah. Hi, everyone. Just want to go back to those East Bay developments. I think you mentioned you had a $40 million cost overrun. But when I look at Avalon Public Market and Avalon Walnut Creek, it looks like the cost went up $30 million. So, did the subcontractor eat the $10 million? And then if you have costs locked-in ahead of time for the developments, was this driven by increased labor costs or did the whole thing just had to be reworked?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Hey, Wes. It's Matt. You're right. What we recognized this quarter across those two projects compared to last quarter was $30 million higher. To be fair, there was an additional $10 million in cost increases we had already recognized on Emeryville, if you go back to the very beginning when we first started the projects. So, relative to what we thought what our initial budgets were, that's where the $40 million came from.\nAnd you're right in that, normally, 90-plus-percent of the time when we start a project we have, most of the trade costs locked-in with subcontractors who perform. And consequently that's why if you look at that slide, over a long, long period of time, we're generally bringing projects in within 1% of budget plus or minus. This is the kind of environment in Northern California, particularly right now, kind of one market once every cycle where you see \u2013 while you thought you had your costs locked-in, the subcontractors failed to perform.\nYou force them to build it. If they're not making money doing it, they thought they could get labor at a certain price, they couldn't. One of those deals in Walnut Creek we had a further complication which was it's a public-private deal with BART as the ground lessor and there were some prevailing wage requirements which in turn created additional union requirements for the execution that we were not expecting there. So, that was a piece of it as well.\nBut, generally, we are very successful in locking down our costs at the start. But there are extreme situations and this would be one of them where the subcontractors just won't perform and you basically have to switch, find new subs at whatever the prevailing market price at that time is.\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nYeah. Wes, maybe just to add a couple of general comments. I think they do apply to what's happened in the East Bay. And as you get late in the cycle like this where we have a lot of production going on, I mentioned earlier just the lack of skilled labor, they are adding skilled labor, but it's oftentimes not as productive, not as good, and just the market is so stretched that the margin for errors is just very low. So, there if one sub fails, it tends to have a cascading effect on all the subs behind them.\nSo, in a normal market, sometimes if one sub fails, you can oftentimes replace them quickly without an impact to schedule or cost to the other subs. That's not this kind of market right now, particularly in Northern California, just a very low margin of error, and something that we're trying to be mindful of from a risk standpoint at this point in the cycle, so.\nWes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nOkay. And then last one for me. We obviously just heard Sears filed bankruptcy and we're hearing from a lot of the retail landlords that this can unlock some densification opportunities. So, have you noticed an uptick in inbound calls to Avalon looking at potential multi-family on retail sites?\nMatthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nJohn, we've actually \u2013 I'm sorry, Wes, that's something we've been working on for a while. And, in fact, the deal I mentioned, the new dev right this quarter which is at the Alderwood Mall outside of Seattle, that is actually a former Sears box. So we're working with GGP on it but actually Seritage is in the deal as well.\nAnd we assigned a fairly senior development person to kind of work on those opportunities really about a year or two ago. So we continue to talk to mall owners, to retail owners, and we do view that as a great opportunity for us. I don't think there's anything \u2013 we're not seeing any more specifically because of the Sears bankruptcy yet, and frankly, a lot of those locations are not locations that we're going to be all that interested in but, as a general macro trend, absolutely.\nWes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nOkay. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator\nThank you. This concludes the Q&A portion for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Tim Naughton for closing remarks.\nTimothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nThank you, Brandon. And thanks for all of you being on today and look forward to seeing you in the near future. Take care.\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may now disconnect your lines.\n\n",

This call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Coody, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nScott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.\nThank you and good morning. I hope everyone has had the chance to review our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial and operational disclosures that were released last night. This data package includes: Our earnings release, forward-looking guidance, and our detailed operations report.\nAlso, on the call today are: Dave Hager, President and CEO; Tony Vaughn, Chief Operating Officer; Tom Mitchell, Chief Financial Officer; and a few other members of our senior management team.\nI would like to remind you that comments and answers to our questions on this call today will contain plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities Law. These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially. For a review of risk factors related to these statements, please see our Form 10-K.\nAnd, with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nThank you, Scott, and welcome, everyone. For Devon, 2016 was a transformational year. We successfully reshaped our portfolio around top two franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin, providing us a sustainable multi-decade growth platform. With these world-class assets, we delivered outstanding operational performance throughout the year.\nOur drilling programs generated the best well productivity results in Devon's 45-year history and we maximized the value of every barrel produced with cost reduction efforts that reached $1.3 billion of annual savings. We also took important steps during the year to strengthen our investment grade financial position with the timely completion of our $3.2 billion asset divestiture program.\nOverall, while 2016 will certainly be remembered for extreme volatility in the energy markets, our unwavering focus on the controllable aspects of our business yielded extremely strong results and we laid the groundwork for Devon to deliver differentiated growth in margins and cash flow expansion as commodity prices recover.\nAs we look to 2017, the next step in our strategic plan is to accelerate investment across our U.S. resource plays, while maintaining our low-cost structure to maximize profitability. With an improving cash flow stream, we are planning to steadily ramp up drilling activity throughout the year to as many as 20 operated drilling rigs by the end of 2017, roughly doubling our rig count from year-end 2016.\nThis ramp up in activity would represent an upstream investment of $2.0 billion to $2.3 billion for the full-year 2017. The majority of this capital will be concentrated on low-risk drilling activity in the STACK and Delaware Basin, and is expected to jumpstart companywide production growth, driving light oil production in the U.S. approximately 15% higher for the full-year 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdditionally, we expect to deliver this attractive growth profile with substantially lower operating costs. In fact, lease operating expenses within our U.S. resource plays in 2017 are expected to be 30% lower than peak rates a few years ago, further bolstering the profitability of our top tier asset portfolio.\nLooking beyond the attractive growth profile Devon is going to deliver in 2017, we're even more excited about our outlook for 2018. Given the nature of pad drilling, the majority of the rig activity deployed in 2017 will provide an even-greater impact to production in 2018. Due to these timing considerations, there is significant operational momentum across our U.S. resource plays heading into 2018, which we project will advance light oil production by approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis. This rapid growth in our highest margin product, coupled or combined with our low-cost structure, positions Devon to deliver peer rating cash flow expansion in today's strip prices.\nHopefully, you can sense my enthusiasm for the significant value we expect to generate with our capital programs in 2017 and 2018. Looking beyond 2018, Devon unquestionably has the quality and depth of resource within our asset portfolio to deliver high returning and sustainable growth for many years to come. Between STACK and Delaware Basin alone, which are two of the very best positioned plays on the North American cost curve, we have exposure to more than 1 million net acres of stacked pay potential.\nAcross these world-class acreage positions, we have identified in excess of 30,000 potential drilling locations, of which, approximately one-third have already been de-risked through successful appraisal work.\nTo further advance our understanding into the ultimate inventory and resource potential within Devon, we have several catalyst-rich projects underway in 2017. In the STACK, we're participating in several Meramec infill pilots can further expand our risked inventory beyond the 40% increase we announced today. These pilots will also help refine our initial multi-zone development in 2017.\nThis milestone development called the Showboat project, is evaluating around 15 wells, a single drilling unit, across three landing zones. Ultimately, we believe we could have spacing as high as 20 to 30 wells in a single drilling unit when co-developing the Meramec and Woodford together.\nMoving to the Woodford, I'd encourage everyone not to lose sight of this under-appreciated play within the STACK. With a massive Hobson and Jacobs Row developments, we expect a step change in efficiency through improved completion and longer laterals that could deliver returns rivaling that of a Meramec formation.\nIn fact, early flow back results from our operating position of the Hobson Row look outstanding with initial well results tracking at, or above, our EUR type curve of 1.6 million BOE per well. Additionally, gross peak production from the Hobson Row are well on their way to exceeding 40,000 BOE per day in the second quarter of this year.\n2017 will also be an important year for our Leonard and Wolfcamp programs in the Delaware Basin, with nearly 60% of our drilling programs in the area devoted toward characterizing these emerging oil plays. We expect the activity to have a material impact to Devon's companywide resource potential and we are eager to progress our understanding of the 12,000-plus potential locations we have identified between these two plays.\nLooking beyond this Delaware and STACK, we're nearing an initial flow black of our diamond spacing in the Eagle Ford, which could expand our high return inventory into play. In the Rockies, rig activity underway is de-risking the Powder River Basin oil fairway, and the technical teams in the Barnett are experimenting with game-changing horizontal refrac technology.\nAs you can see, there are many significant projects ongoing that will help us further characterize the full resource potential we possess across our resource plays. With continued appraisals of success, these catalyst-rich drilling efforts in 2017 will further supplement our great collection of assets that are well balanced between scalable growth plays and top-tier cash flow generating properties. This advantaged asset base provides tremendous optionality going forward.\nAnd lastly, I want to be very clear on this. While having a premier portfolio is essential to winning in the E&P space, developing these assets through superior execution is equally important. Over the past few years, we have done a tremendous amount of work here at Devon to reshape our corporate culture and made a commitment to invest in leading-edge technology to establish a competitive edge.\nThrough this pursuit of excellence, we have substantially reduced drilling times, we have maximized value per well with industry-leading completion designs, and we've optimized our base production with best-in-class field operations. Notably, these efforts have not only lowered costs across the board but they have dramatically increased Devon's well productivity by greater than 300% since 2012.\nThis quality work firmly places us among the very best operators in North America. However, we are not satisfied with our recent accomplishments, and the teams here at Devon are passionately pursuing to improve all aspects of our business in 2017.\nWith the drill bit, I absolutely expect capital efficiency and well productivity will continue to ratchet higher as we shift a majority of our drilling activity toward extended-reach laterals in the STACK and Delaware Basin. Additionally, we are aggressively taking steps to offset industry inflation by decoupling historically bundled services, and we're utilizing a much more diversified vendor universe to achieve the best value for our LOE and capital dollars.\nWe are also adding long-term service contracts, where prudent, to better capture terms at the bottom of the cycle. Another area of our business that has the potential to meaningfully improve our operating performance is the application of innovative technologies in the realm of Big Data, where we view ourselves as leaders in the E&P space.\nWe are at the forefront of these emerging technology trends that will help us continue to deliver improved results through predictive analytics and the deployment of artificial intelligence in our field operation. We are just scratching the surface with regards to the potential of our advanced analytics initiatives, which we believe have the potential to unlock hundreds of millions of dollars of value annually. We expect the application of these technologies to not only to contribute to better well productivity, but also to help us further optimize our operating costs and keep overhead expense lower through more efficient data systems and workflow across our organization.\nSo in summary, the future is very bright for Devon. We have the right assets, the right technical staff, the right culture, and our business is backstopped by an investment grade financial position. As we execute on our strategic plan, Devon shares are positioned to deliver peer-leading returns through our rapid shift to higher-margin production, substantial cash flow growth, and a re-rating of our trading multiples better reflects our premium assets and operatorship.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Scott.\nScott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.\nThanks, Dave. We will now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If you have further questions, you can re-prompt as time permits.\nWith that, operator, we'll take our first question.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nYour first question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nEvan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nHey. Good morning, guys.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nGood morning.\nEvan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nSo you guys \u2013 you added significant locations in the Meramec and you have a large location upside in the Delaware where you're ramping up activity most this year. I guess the question is, is how do you think about the portfolio impact if your location count continues to grow? And do you have enough confidence in the current direction to trigger another round of asset sales in 2017?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nWell, we obviously are working our way through the appraisal of a number of different zones, as you highlight, both in the STACK play and the Delaware Basin. And the results so far have been very, very encouraging that we've seen with not only the number of zones that are working in both of these plays as well as the potential or down spacing in both of these plays. So we think we have the \u2013 we're positioned in a couple of the best basins in onshore North America, and we have some of the best position in those best basins. So we feel really good about that.\nWe do want to further our understanding before we make any strategic decisions such as that. We're also working some of these other areas that may be consideration and we're improving the results in those areas at the same time. We're going to have \u2013 for instance in the Barnett, we're going to have a refrac program that is at a substantially lower cost than we've done previously that could really be a game-changer in terms of the returns on that program. We're also going to drill some new wells with modern drilling and completion technology that hasn't been done for several years.\nSo we want to see all of this work come together as far as finalizing or getting more data as far as how big our inventory really is in these top-tier resource plays and in doing some work in some of these other plays to really understand the full potential of these plays before making any sort of strategic decision. Now, I'll say, if you go back over the past few years, we haven't been \u2013 if you look at us as a company, we haven't been hesitant to make the right decision at the right time as far as optimizing our portfolio. We think it's really important to, if we ever do make a decision this way, that we have the best information available when we do that.\nEvan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nMaybe a follow up on the delineation side. I mean, you have two rigs in Woodward and Dewey counties, they're outside the core of the play, can you discuss what your testing there? What zones? And potentially what that could de-risk for you?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nI'm going to let Tony Vaughn, our Chief Operating Officer, answer that question for you.\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nEvan, we've got \u2013 I think we've commented before but we have about 80,000 acres outside the core of our footprint in STACK. You probably have read some of the competitors are testing for the Osage and the Meramec and we're continuing to work some prospectivity in those areas, trying to gain an understanding of really where the play moves.\nEvan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nAny idea on timing there in terms of when we might have some results there?\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nWe're engaged in some operations right now, both on the drilling and the completions side of it. So it'd probably be the second half of 2017 before we have a better understanding about our thoughts there.\nEvan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nGreat. Good results, guys.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nWell, thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nGood morning, Doug.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nHopefully you can hear me okay.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nYes.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nDave, can you just remind us what is the spacing assumption, I guess wells for DSU, that you're assuming in the 1,600 locations in the Meramec. And what's behind my question is, 20 to 30, it seems like quite a big step-up, and I'm just wondering if you could help frame for us if that's across the entire play or just the over pressured area or just how you're thinking about how that 1,600 locations has \u2013 what the upside risk is for that?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nAll right. Doug, thanks for the question. In summary, we see tremendous potential for that continuing to increase through time. Right now we average six wells per section across the entire position in that number. As we \u2013 and it is a much higher number, probably around 13 wells per production, and obviously, the average six is much lower outside the core and we've essentially put none of the locations we've counted within the liquids-rich part of the window, where we are participating along with some of our peer companies and the drilling activity there as well. So we see that there is tremendous upside to this as we further appraise the entire area. So we're just getting started.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nAll right. I appreciate that. I guess I'm going to ask you about the portfolio as well, if I may, because let's assume you have a tripling or a quadrupling of the inventory in the STACK, I think Tony has said in the past that your Delaware Basin slope or your Delaware slope acreage probably wouldn't compete for capital; your Barnett production or assets probably struggles to compete for capital, so what do you need to see to \u2013 or whether or not you can actually confirm that is the case that those are maybe non-core assets, and what do you need to see to maybe start thinking about moving those forward as another assets disposition program ? And I will it leave it there. Thanks.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nWell, again, we are looking to further quantify just how rich our inventory is. We know it's rich, but we would like to get more information on the spacing in the various intervals that we're testing both in the STACK play and the Delaware Basin. Also, and just how many of these different intervals are working. So we would like to further detail that to know for sure. It has certainly been true historically that the slope in the Delaware Basin does not appear to compete as well. Although I will note there've been some pretty big purchases their recently by some other companies. But I think historically it has not competed as well.\nAnd the Barnett, although you can get returns well above the cost of capital, have not competed in our portfolio. But again, we are currently testing some innovations in the refrac technology side to significantly lower that cost, and we're trying some new wells out there with modern drilling and completion. So we would like to understand that potential before, both in terms of just how deep our inventory is, and also what is the real upside better from these other plays before we make a final decision.\nWe understand the question very well. It's not lost on us. We understand, and like I say, we have not hesitated historically when the time is right to make these strategic decisions. But that's what we're working through before we make a decision.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nVery clear, Dave. Thanks very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nRyan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe a question on the \u2013 the first question on the type curve in the STACK. I mean, at this point, you've only provided one that's been for a 5,000 foot well. Any color on how we should think about the reserves from the 10,000 foot longer laterals that you're drilling now? And 30 day rates? Should we extrapolate in terms of kind of reserves for lateral foot from the 5,000 foot wells? And what's the average well cost at this point are you expecting from a 10,000-foot lateral?\nScott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.\nHey, Ryan, this is Scott. And, last quarter, we did roll out our first extended-reach type-curve for what we considered the overpressured oil window within the STACK and the EURs on that are approaching 2 million barrels per well on an equivalent basis. And depending upon the strength of the casing, whether it's two or three, the cost of the \u2013 D&C cost can range from $7.5 million to $9 million. And from an IP rate perspective, these are pretty prolific wells as well; it's well north of 2,000 barrels equivalent per day on a 30-day rate. So that's our initial type curve. And I think Tony can talk about maybe what we're seeing at the early results on that and how it's trending.\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nYeah. Thanks. Scott did a good job of characterizing the type-curve there for the 10,000-foot wells. And the producing history that we've had on those is really exhibiting better performance over time than even the 5,000-foot laterals. So there is additional upside in our type-curve, I believe. We need more information to look at that, but we're quite pleased with the 10,000-foot wells over the 5000-foot wells and we'll certainly try to maximize every opportunity we can to drill those 10,000 footers.\nRyan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nAnd on the longer laterals, is there room \u2013 I appreciated the incremental shift towards 65% of the inventory of 1,700 wells in the STACK being the longer lateral. Is there room for that to shift higher at this point? Or how should we expect your ability to drill longer laterals to trend over the next little while?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nYeah, Ryan, I think that's what our technical teams do every day. I think they're looking for opportunities to core up either through small-scale land acquisitions or trades and also, looking to work with other operators there. We've got a great relationship with the other primary operators in STACK trying to maximize the efficiency of each of our operations, and so that's working quite well. And I think the positions are largely made between the large operators. So there is potential for that to continually inch its way up.\nRyan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nThanks. And then maybe if I can ask one on your view on costs. I mean, what did your 2017 capital budget assume in terms of well costs relative to constant 2016? How much inflation do you assume? What are you seeing today? And any expectations on what you expect over the course of 2017 and maybe into 2018 in terms of the cost structure?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nWhen we were out a few months ago talking about that, we said we expected high-single digit inflation across all aspects of the business. We have revised that upwards a little bit now, we're saying now in the 10% to 15% across all aspects of the business. And so if you look at our \u2013 and we have accounted for that in the capital guidance that we provided to you. We were originally talking about a capital program around $2 billion, a couple, three months ago.\nIt's been now at a $2 billion to $2.3 billion. We probably upped the midpoint about $150 million of that. About $100 million of that is due to just moving up the timing of some rig activity, particularly in the Delaware Basin. And about the other $50 million or so is due to additional cost inflation.\nNow at the same time, we think we can largely mitigate about 75% of this cost inflation that we anticipate to see this year. And you're seeing examples of us across our portfolio where we're lowering the drill times associated with these wells. Our 24/7 365 drilling control room is really helping out a great deal with the efficiency, and nearly 100% in zone on these wells. So yes, it does appear the inflation has picked up somewhat from a few months ago, but we think we can largely offset that.\nRyan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nGreat. Thanks. Very helpful.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nArun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nYeah, good morning. My first question just involves your CapEx program from this year of $2.5 billion at the midpoint, which is kind of below your upstream cash flow potential that you highlight on page six of the ops report of $2.7 billion. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on spending a little bit below cash flow and the strategy behind that and maybe some thoughts around 2018. You highlighted $3.5 billion of upstream cash flow potential. What does that 20%-type growth number for U.S. light oil, what does that embed in terms of CapEx next year?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nWell \u2013 hi, Arun. This is Dave. First off, from a corporate standpoint, given the strength of our balance sheet and our financial strength, we are comfortable right now spending approximately at cash flow in any given year. We want to stay a strong investment-grade credit company. And we believe with our net debt position at this point that the spending within cash flow is approximately where we should be. Now, we recognize, depending on whose price deck you use that there may be the potential to \u2013 that we may have a little bit of free cash flow this year. I think frankly, there probably you would have to subtract off the dividend off the numbers in our book there, and then you'd probably see we're really at cash flow neutral.\nBut if there is the potential where we have a little bit stronger cash flow than we anticipate, we certainly have the program and we are very confident we can deliver on good returns on that program for a little bit higher capital spend. So that we are not doing \u2013 not announcing we're doing that, obviously, right now but that potential is there. We have some of the highest, best positions in onshore North America, and we have focused on delivering outstanding returns on that. And we could ratchet up to some degree our capital spending and be confident that we could maintain those returns.\nAs far as the 2017 \u2013 or excuse me \u2013 the 2018 capital program, basically, what we're \u2013 we're not going to give you specific numbers there, but do feel comfortable stating that we're roughly planning to once again spend within cash flow and deliver on our growth targets that we've outlined there.\nArun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nThat's helpful.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nAnother thing to keep in mind on that, the 2018 capital spend really has a bigger impact on 2019 production than it does 2018 production. Really, the bulk of the 2018 production given the time delay between when you spend the money and you just have first production is largely determined by the 2017 capital spend.\nArun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nThat's great. I guess my follow-up is I wanted to go back to a comment that you all put in the press release just talking about Canada and the tremendous upside exists within your Canadian resource potential. You highlighted $1.4 billion of resource potential there. Wanted to see \u2013 obviously, a lot around Canada recently with the market concern around border taxes. How are you thinking about an investment decision at Pike? And given the resource potential that you have in the Delaware as well as the STACK and elsewhere in the Lower 48 portfolio, I was wondering how you guys were thinking about Pike, obviously that's with BP?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nWell, that's a decision that we will visit the second half of 2017. We are very confident that Pike is going to be like Jackfish in the sense that it's going to be a top 10% type project in the SAGD. Geologically, it looks just as good if not better than a Jackfish project. And obviously, we've have shown the ability to execute on the construction side at Jackfish as well as anybody and we have the graphs in our operations report that just show the efficiency with which we're able to manage that production too in terms of steam-oil-ratios and it also goes back as well to just the quality of other reservoir. So we like the project a great deal.\nNow, obviously, the question is not what prices are going to be in 2017, but what we anticipate prices will be when first production happens, which would probably be around 2021 or so. And so we are hoping to get some greater clarity on that question. There are other variables that, obviously, factor into it beyond price and also just the capital costs.\nWe do not necessarily see the proposed border adjustment tax as a negative to Canadian prices. We do see where it could be a positive overall for our portfolio and that the bulk of our oil is in the U.S. and we think it would cause WTI prices to go up. It may cause the differentials to increase a little bit, but not necessarily lower the prices coming out of Canada, because that heavy oil is needed by the refineries here in the U.S. That's what they're tooled to handle. And with the decrease in Mayan crude, particularly too, we think that the draw on Canadian crude will still be there largely. So we don't see that as a negative on our Canadian operations at all.\nYou might even benefit from a positive FX as well, impact to it. So we'll visit that question in the second half of the year. We like the project a lot but, obviously, it does take a \u2013 it's a little bit lower return in our well-oriented programs here in the U.S., but the way I'd like to describe is more the bond in our portfolio. It's a lower risk. We know how do it and generate good returns with it. So we'll make a call along with our partner, BP, later on in the year on this.\nArun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nOkay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.\nCharles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC\nGood morning, Dave, and to the rest of your team there.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nGood morning, Charles.\nCharles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC\nI'd like to ask a question about the Delaware Basin. And I know we spent a lot of time talking about what you guys are doing up there, in Lea and Eddy counties, but you've got this other center of gravity down there along the Reeves and Ward line, along the Pecos River. And I'm sure it hasn't escaped your attention that there has been a lot of A&D activity down there. And I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what the nature of your position down there is and how testing your development on that position slots into your drilling plans for this year and beyond?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nTony is dying to tell you about it, Charles. That's why we call our Maveda (32:25) area down there. And so, I'm going to let Tony talk about it a while.\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nCharles, you're right. There is a lot of A&D work down there. A lot of extremely high price per acre transactions have occurred. We've watched that. We've also spent a good bit of a subsurface evaluation time on our position looking at the results from our competitors there. So we think we're in the right country for good return work. We've got activity planned for the latter part of 2017. And again, as we manage our investment in the Delaware Basin, we've tried to highlight the primary areas that we'll be working there in our operating reports. So while we'll be drilling about 100 wells, the majority of those will be in those four areas there in southeastern Mexico. But we are working on some appraisal-type work in the Maveda (33:23) area and certainly watching a lot of activity around us that are helping us de-risk that. So it's a good play, as you mentioned, and something we'll incorporate into our development plans.\nCharles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC\nThat's great detail, Tony. Thank you. And, Dave, for my follow-up, I'd like to pick up on something you said in your prepared remarks. You talked about Devon being a leader in Big Data. To the extent you're comfortable, can you tell us where in your operations you're using Big Data that's yielding good results? And what makes you a leader? And what sort of things should we look for going forward from your efforts on this front?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nTony would like to do this one also.\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nCharles, thanks for the question. And it's probably about three years ago, we made a large commitment internally to be more fact-based and data-driven in our day-to-day work. We spent quite a bit of time in that, we brought in and incorporated some people from outside the industry to help us get through that work. So collectively, it's been a big effort. So as we've taken the information or that data collection and we talk about all the different types of subsurface data that we're acquiring, also that has been included in our surface work.\nSo we stood up some decision-support centers was the first thing that we did, just monitoring all of our producing assets from around the company. Minimizing downtime, trying to maximize the production rate from that, but it really has greatly expanded from that. So while we're acquiring a lot of this information, we've found ways now to get that information in the hands of our technical teams, more real-time than we have in the past. And so the data reporting has elevated us to a new level here internally. We're incorporating that into all phases of our business. And some different areas that we're working on it, as you mentioned, was on a artificial lift reliability.\nSo now we're watching daily information \u2013 more than daily information on all of our submersible pumps and gas lift injection rates across the company and are able to better predict the reliability of those pumps. We're able to better schedule maintenance on those pumps so we have limited downtime. We're also incorporating this data into our well flow-back type work. We're able to monitor our rates and pressures and really get the wells off of the well flow back environment quicker. That happens to save about $50,000 per well. We've incorporated this data into our coal-tipping drill outs and the completion phase of our work. And so while we're seeing this pressure and rate information on that portion of our business, it's also accelerating our coal-tipping drill outs to the point of saving about $100,000 per well.\nAnd then we're also incorporating this into our drilling business now, so we're using it to help geosteer wells and position our drill bit and using that data really to do it in a quicker, more efficient manner than we can, with just standing up additional personnel to watch that on a day-by-day basis.\nSo Charles, we've talked to you a little bit about the WellCon center in the past and at one time, we probably had 30 to 40 people working in that WellCon, and now it's under 10 people still managing the same type of work, perhaps looking at more information than we have in the past and making real-time decisions. It's really just causing things like our Delaware Basin wells we're getting from spud to TD in about 10 days now. And probably about a year ago at the time that we were more active there, that was about 17 or 18 days. So this is just a way that has tuned up our business in small increments across the company.\nCharles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC\nThanks for the detail, Tony.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nPaul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC\nGood morning, all. In terms of all your various choices, could you talk a little bit at a high level about the marginal decision between natural gas and oil? It just seems that the prices are so far apart of the two commodities. But I'd like to know more about your sort of thinking in terms of what kind of returns you need? What kind of risk you put on either kind of activity? Thank you.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nPaul, I'm not sure exactly where you're going with that, but what I would say is that we obviously are driven by returns in all of our capital allocation decisions. And those returns are largely driven by the \u2013 what the anticipated prices are for both oil and natural gas. Given right now the relative strength of oil compared to natural gas, that does mean that the bulk of our capital program is going to those plays that have a higher proportion of oil versus our dry gas type opportunities. We still have some of those in the portfolio, and the Barnett would be the big one and some areas even in a deeper part of Cana for instance, that we're \u2013 not have a lot of activity going.\nSo that will drive our capital allocation decisions; they were just our belief in what the relative strength of the commodities will be. And obviously, that not only does it from our capital allocation, but we take that into account when we are making strategic decisions as to where we think the portfolio should be positioned.\nPaul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC\nYeah, I mean, I guess it's a fairly simple question but it was really the Barnett that I was thinking of and how come there would be any kind of investment? I mean, how good do the returns have to be given the price discrepancy between the two commodities? And is it sort of a maintenance activity with distributor CapEx going there, or is there genuine \u2013 I mean you said that you pursue return, so I just wondered quite how you could get there. It must be...\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nWell, we're spending money there not to maintain production. We are 100% dedicated to putting our capital where we believe the highest returns are. In the case of the Barnett \u2013 and Tony can detail it, we are spending a little bit of capital there this year, not a large amount because we are investigating the \u2013 how well a new re-frac design, which may be around $700,000 versus previously is around $1 million to $1.2 million cost to re-frac those wells \u2013 how well that is going to work. And if that is successful, it could have returns that are very competitive within our portfolio. There is also the potential that with a modern drilling and completion design that you could also have returns that are competitive within our portfolio.\nRemember, we haven't had an active drilling program there for several years and there has been tremendous advancements on both the drilling and completion side since then. So we aren't putting a lot of capital into that, but the only reason we are is because we believe that that could lead to a program that could be competitive within our portfolio or anybody else's portfolio if we choose to make a strategic decision around that.\nPaul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC\nYeah, I think that's what I was driving at. It's just interesting that there's any kind of activity there. And I guess it's a bit bearish for natural gas that there is. Just the second question would be on the Delaware. Can you talk more about the nature of your activity there? Is it primarily an appraisal-type activity or is it in the exploration realm? Thanks.\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nPaul, it's really not in the exploration nor the appraisal. We're doing a little bit of appraisal work across our position, but for the most part, we're moving into developments in 2017. And so you will see on the operating report on the Delaware section there, the four core areas that we're working. We've already got three rigs stood up right now working the Thistle area. That's going to be predominantly a Leonard Shale development. We've announced in December that we had a couple of good wells stacked on top of each other in the B and the C, and we've seen industry work in the A. So we think we have a very hearty development plan there for the Thistle area.\nAnd Cotton Draw has been an area that we've had a \u2013 the majority of our historic second Bone Spring work. And again, we'll have rigs working there through the year, developing additional Bone Springs, Delaware, Leonard and some Wolfcamp-type activity. And in the Rattlesnake in the southeastern portion of our position there, we'll actually be standing up work there in the second half of the year, prosecuting the Leonard Shale but primarily the Wolfcamp. And we've seen some really outstanding results from some operators adjacent to our footprint there in Rattlesnake that have had some stellar wells. So we're really trying to move our Delaware and STACK into the development mode as quick as we can. We continue to do some amount of appraisal work year-in year-out just to prepare for the next year's developments.\nPaul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC\nGreat...\nScott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.\nHey. And Paul, real quick. This is Scott. Just to add on a little bit at the end of that, just to provide a percentage, about three-quarters of our activity is going to be development drilling. And that's one of the reasons why we're so confident with our production outlook with the Delaware Basin. If you look in our operations report, you're going to see greater than 20% growth from Q4 to Q4 on a 2017 to 2016 basis. And obviously, we expect to stabilize production in the first quarter. And even more important, I think, is just how excited we are about the momentum that carries into 2018. So this is absolutely going to be a strong growth asset with some of the best returns in North America.\nPaul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC\nGreat and thank you for your help.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Matt Portillo from TPH. Your line is open.\nMatthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.\nGood morning, guys.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nGood morning, Matt.\nMatthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.\nJust a quick question on the Jacobs Row. Wanted to see if we could get a little bit of color around how you're thinking about the hydrocarbon mix, obviously Hobson's gotten into an oilier section from a development perspective and Jacobs offsets that. And then I wanted to see if we could get any high-level color in regards to timing of, kind of, rig allocation there and when we may start to see first production from that very large development.\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nMatt, this is Tony again. And just let me start a little bit with the work that we're doing on the Hobson Row and then I'll move into that Jacobs Row there. But we're about halfway through that five-section position that we have in the Hobson Row. And Dave's opening comments, he commented the results we're having there are outstanding and we're on track with that development. What's unique about the Hobson Row, the reason why I wanted to bring this up is that if you start \u2013 as you start on the west side of that five-section footprint there, you've got fairly leaner fluid type that we're producing, but as you move through the \u2013 quickly move into the heart of those five sections, we have a higher oil content there. And so we've commented that we're seeing 25%-plus oil content.\nAs you move to the far eastern side of that footprint, we expect it to be even higher there. So while we don't have everything completely delineated on the Jacobs Row, I think it's going to be in that higher oily mix, at least to 25% going forward.\nWhen we think about the timing of bringing in rigs for the Jacobs Row, we're in the midst of our plans right now. We think that will be the second half of 2017. You can see there that it's a larger development in the Hobson Row. We're going to incorporate the number of rigs and frac crews to timely get through that so we're maximizing the present value of that operation.\nMatthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.\nGreat. And then just a follow up to Canada. We've continued to see improvements on the operating side in regards to Jackfish. I was curious if there is any other de-bottlenecking opportunities for expansion on the production side. And then a follow on to the comments on Pike. If we think about, kind of, 2018 and 2019, if you were to move forward with potentially sanctioning, what sort of call on capital could we expect, ballpark, around the project?\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nMatt, I'd tell you, I've got to complement our operating team in Canada right now. They are extremely efficient, they have de-bottlenecked J1, J2 and J3 to the point we're seeing daily production rates, 10,000 barrels, 12,000 barrels per day above nameplate capacity. And that's a function of de-bottlenecking on the surface, but it's also \u2013 it's a function of their clear understanding of how to optimize steam injection into that high quality rock. So we're rocking along at a pretty high rate in our minds. We've got some fairly new pads that have been brought on in the latter part of 2016 that has really helped move that production rate up. We're starting to work on another pad that will have some rate benefit in early 2018. But they're doing an excellent job on the Jackfish operating of those plants there.\nAs you think about Pike going forward, it's really a fairly minor capital draw on the company. As you think about that, we're 50/50 with BP. We staggered the capital profile out so, just to give you order of magnitude, if we were to sanction later this year, in 2018, that draw would be about $50 million net and would go to about $150 million for the next couple of years. Dave mentioned, we'll get the first team about 2021. So in the grand scheme of things, it's really about 5% of the company capital as you look out in time. So it's really not that significant.\nMatthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nScott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nThanks. Good morning. Dave, I hope I won't wear you down again with another, kind of, portfolio kind of question, but when you step back and look, obviously, you talk about the potential of 20,000-plus wells in the Delaware, you're drilling about 100 this year. So certainly it seems like at the current pace, the value potential is not being maximized. But as you step back and understand how industries have been fairly aggressive of buying acreage in the Delaware Basin at what looks like pretty, pretty good prices.\nAnd it seems like your desire to maybe want to maximize the value by finding out first what you have and what new technology will show you on those assets. How do you balance the two? And when you look at it, is it more about understanding the potential before you look to monetize it? Or is there a consideration, we may just keep this and decide to outspend cash flow to monetize it ourselves. Can you just give us a sense of the high-level perspective?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nWell, I'm not going to announce anything today, so I'm not sure I can really answer that question fully. But I would say we're working both sides to really understand what the potential is in a more complete manner in our core plays both in the STACK and the Delaware Basin, as well as trying to make sure we understand the true value of other assets that may be considered for monetization. You never have complete knowledge. We understand that. There is not a set point in time where you fully understand, and you would make this call. But it's our judgment right now that we would like to learn more rather than make that decision today. But again, it's not lost on us that there is at some point that call will have to be made, one way or the other. And we certainly, as I keep saying it, have not shown any reluctance to do that historically when we think the time is right to do that.\nWe fully understand the values that are being paid in the Delaware Basin. We understand all the variables. I don't need to iterate or lay them all out on the table here I don't think. But we just feel that it would be helpful to have some increased knowledge at this point of the continued appraisal in both the STACK and the Delaware Basin before we make that final call.\nScott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nOkay. No, I appreciate that. And, Dave, just to clarify. So is the likelihood more or less that if the timing is right, the price is right you'd monetize versus look to outspend to bring forth the value?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nI would say it has probably, on balance, probably the more likely scenario, that we would go that direction, yes, I would agree with that.\nScott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nOkay. No, fair enough. Thanks. And as a follow up, could you clarify too on your identified inventory in the Permian, how much of that is roughly in the slope versus in the basin? And down in the Nevada area, if you could just clarify what the size of that position is?\nScott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.\nYeah. Scott, this is Scott. With regards to the inventory, probably two-thirds is going to be in the basin, which we consider is superior returns to the slope. And as far as the acreage, you're probably looking 55% of our acreage from a surface perspective is going to be located in the basin as well. So we're certainly levered to the basin.\nScott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nThanks.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Biju Perincheril from Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nBiju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nThanks. Good morning. Dave, you talked about two Bone Spring wells in the operations report, and I was wondering, are those wells targeted in similar landing zones as what you've been targeting there? Or would this be something different?\nScott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.\nAnd, Biju, your question, you broke up a little bit. Your question is what landing zones for the Bone Spring in those particular wells? And I will hand it over to Tony. But essentially those are in two very different areas than where we've drilled historically. It was the Thistle area, obviously was one of those areas where we drilled the Bone Spring and I believe it's the Todd area is where we drilled our other Bone Spring. And, Tony, feel free to jump in, but obviously I believe it's a second Bone Spring is what the Todd area would be targeting. And when you think about the Thistle, that might be a more shallow member of the Bone Spring.\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nYeah, the Thistle is going to be really dominated by the Leonard development there, but we do have about half a dozen wells in the second Bone that's going to be drilled, but in the Todd area that's going to be largely dominated by the second Bone Springs, a little bit of Leonard and Wolfcamp activity there. We also know that we had the Upper Bone Springs second Bone Spring's member available to us in Cotton Draw and the Todd area that we'll be incorporating into our developments.\nScott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.\nBut, Biju, just to provide a more global thought when you think about our overarching inventory and the play for the Bone Spring, we have inventory across the first, second and third members of the Bone Springs. So \u2013 and it just depends on where you're at within the basin. It can be very localized. But certainly, we're more heavily levered towards that second Bone Spring opportunity, which we believe delivers the best returns.\nBiju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nOkay. And then my second question is in the Meramec, when I look at the Alma pilot versus the Pump House, the middle well in Pump House is performing right in line with the outer wells. Maybe you see it's a little bit lower performance on the bounded wells in the Alma, which I guess is what you would expect normally. Just wondering, that difference in the two, the two pilots is \u2013 how do you explain that? Is that geologies or anything that you did in terms of landing zones or completions that would explain the better performance out of the Pump House pilot?\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nBiju, we were actually happy with the results out of the Pump House pilot. I think that was helpful for us to understand the lateral spacing that we had there. But the Alma was also \u2013 was helpful in understanding what it was. We just \u2013 we didn't see the communication between the five-well pilot that we pumped in the Alma, and so we've been pleased with the work that we're seeing in both of those. I'd say the repeatability across our footprint there, primarily in the core of the play, has been extremely high. We're continuing to see better performance in the optimization.\nIn fact, if you looked at some of our year-end reserve work, we're able to add a substantial amount of general revisions due to increased performance from a lot of these new STACK plays in comparison to the original type curves. So we've been pleased with all the pilots. They've been very informative to us. We haven't seen a real train wreck out there and we think the play, at least in the area that the industry has been working, is very repeatable.\nScott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.\nAnd, Biju, just one thing to add on with that and it's really kind \u2013 we've been asked a lot about the upside with the STACK play. And one of the \u2013 one example that's lost on a lot of people but not you would be that with that \u2013 with the offsetting well actually not showing degradation, and a lot of that comes down to landing zone. We're still optimizing landing zones in this early-stage play. So as we continue to better understand landing zones and we extend these laterals out further, that's where we expect well productivity and capital efficiency to continue to ratchet up in this play.\nBiju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nAll right. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy. Your line in open.\nDavid Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC\nGood morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. As I was looking at the Hobson chart in your forecast and your comments about where you were as far as timing into that, I had a couple of questions just as you think about that forecast. First, did that include the 40% of the wells that are above the curve, or is this your forecast before you started bring the wells online?\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nWell, the forecast is based on our type curve, David.\nDavid Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC\nSo your above the type curve. And so can you \u2013 what would be great, I guess as you get into second quarter and third quarter is to overlay the actuals because it looks like that would track above that forecast, just given your bullet number two in that section about the request.\nTony D. Vaughn - Devon Energy Corp.\nYeah, I think we'll be happy to, David. I tell you when you look at the results we're seeing, it's extremely early. The results have been above type curve and their wells are cleaning up. But if you remember, we're about \u2013 we're probably about halfway through on a real-time basis on these \u2013 on the completion of these wells. And so the flow-back is pretty early.\nDavid Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC\nYeah. No, that's cool. And then, Dave, maybe \u2013 I'm a little confused around some of the questions on the call of selling parts of your core assets in the Delaware or the monetization as you're in kind of the early phase of appraisal. I guess I'd assume that you guys are still in the mode of delineating and trying to determine what your potential is and that a sale of any of those assets would be not even a consideration yet. And so did I miss something in kind of where investor expectations were, because it's kind of confusing (58:49) that direction.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nI believe the questions, David, were not around the sale of any of our core assets, the core of the Delaware Basin or the core of the STACK or anything but were...\nDavid Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC\nThe flow?\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\n...more directed around some assets that we could still have some capital programs that are probably well above the cost of capital, but they're not going to compete in our portfolio and not going to receive capital. And so the question is, I believe that the people are asking is, at what point will you make that decision that that's not going to be an area that you're going to allocate significant capital to and might consider for rationalization?\nDavid Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC\nOkay.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nBut certainly, there is no consideration on our point of selling any of the core assets in our portfolio. We're glad we have them and we think we're some of the best, and we're going to execute on them incredibly well.\nDavid Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC\nYeah, I guess it was just the high-value acreage that may be on the slope and there's been transactions around it. So it is a little more fringy versus on a big block, of course. So maybe that was my confusion. Thanks for clearing that up.\nDavid A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.\nYeah, I think they that's probably the questionable area, yeah.\nDavid Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC\nOkay. Thanks.\nScott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.\nWell, I'm showing that we're at the top of the hour, and there're still a lot of people left in our queue. So we apologize for everyone that we're not getting to and \u2013 but, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team at any point which consist of myself and Chris Carr, and have a good day. And we do appreciate your interest in Devon. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you, everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\n\n",

Adobe\u2019s strong performance continued in Q3. We achieved $1.005 billion in revenue, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28. Adoption of Creative Cloud, Adobe Marketing Cloud, and Document Services was robust, demonstrating continued momentum across our businesses.\nIn Digital Media, we continued to deliver new innovation and enhanced value for our customers spanning our Creative and Document Services businesses. In June we unveiled a major update to Creative Cloud with 14 new versions of our desktop applications and four new mobile apps, and we announced the Creative SDK for mobile devices. We added new offerings for enterprises, educational institutions and photographers.\nWith the pace of innovation accelerating with Creative Cloud, adoption from existing as well as new customers has been outstanding. We exited Q3 with $1.4 billion of Creative Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR, which now includes more than 2.8 million Creative Cloud subscriptions and reflects a record increase of more than 500,000 from the prior quarter.\nTo capitalize on the large opportunity with Creative Cloud, we remain focused on three growth initiatives. First, we are aggressively converting the large installed base of CS customers to Creative Cloud. This transition is going well as CS customers realize the significant value they obtain when they migrate. We are driving this conversion with individuals through trials and promotional pricing on Adobe.com, and moving enterprises and teams to Creative Cloud through direct sales and the channel.\nSecond, we are expanding the market opportunity through acquiring new customers with tailored offerings such as Creative Cloud for photographers. The potential market for creative expression has never been greater, with the desire to use creative tools at work, at home and at school. While Adobe remains dedicated to meeting the needs of the creative professional, we see big opportunities ahead with a broader array of workers, students and consumers \u2013 and you will continue to see new targeted offerings for these audiences.\nAnd third, we will significantly expand the definition of Creative Cloud with mission critical and valuable services such as mobile apps built on our SDK, training, a marketplace for content, and talent search and acquisition. This focus will expand the Creative Cloud market opportunity and revenue potential beyond our current subscription offerings.\nMAX has become the community\u2019s showcase for creative inspiration and innovation, and we are excited about what we will be able to announce and deliver in October, particularly in the area of mobile, which represents a big opportunity for our customers and for Adobe. In Document Services, we achieved strong revenue of $208 million in Q3. Our Document Services business spans Acrobat ETLAs, cloud-based Acrobat services and Echosign. Document Services ARR grew to $217 million exiting Q3.\nPDF and Acrobat are de facto standards for document collaboration and workflows, and mobile represents huge potential to increase usage of our document creation, sharing, and signing services. We have permission to expand our footprint and brand in these areas, and are excited about the product roadmap which will position our document solutions as must haves now and in the future. Across our Creative and Document Services businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $1.62 billion at the end of Q3. \nDigital marketing is an explosive category that is fundamentally transforming every business. In order to enable the personalized experience that every consumer expects, companies need to invest significantly in a modern technology platform. This revolution is beginning in marketing, but is extending to include the entire real-time enterprise.\nWe are the leader in this category. We achieved strong Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings in Q3, and have a healthy pipeline heading into Q4. The volume and size of engagements with our customers is growing. In Q3, the number of customers with annual contract value of greater than $500,000 grew by more than 40% year-over-year.\nExamples of marketing-cloud customers wins in the quarter included Adidas, Biogen, British Sky, Ford Motor, H&M, Lloyds Bank, Nestle, The State of Illinois, The State of Utah, Tiffany, Travelocity, The U.S. Department of Treasury, The U.S. Marine Corp, DSV in Germany and Motorola in the UK.\nOur value proposition is clearly resonating with marketers, driven by the market share and thought leadership that we have built in the category. Interest in our solutions is high, as evidenced by sold-out conferences across the globe. In addition, we are earning strong industry analyst recognition for our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. Forrester recognized Adobe as a Strong Performer and best positioned in their Digital Experience Delivery Platforms report. Gartner named Adobe a Leader in their 2014 Magic Quadrant for Mobile App Development Platforms, highlighting the capabilities of Adobe Experience Manager, PhoneGap and Digital Publishing Suite. And Forrester named Adobe Campaign a Leader in their Cross Channel Campaign Management 2014 Wave report.\nThis recognition and our leadership in the Digital Marketing industry is helping to build an even stronger partner ecosystem with software companies, agencies and systems integrators. Recent partnerships include: A global reseller agreement where SAP will resell Adobe Marketing Cloud with their HANA platform and hybris Commerce Suite. The relationship has progressed well since the announcement in March.\nA strategic partnership with The Publicis Groupe to deliver the first end-to-end marketing management platform automating all components of a client\u2019s marketing efforts. All Publicis agencies will standardize on Adobe Marketing Cloud, making this our most comprehensive agency partnership to date and a partnership with Wipro, a leader in global IT, consulting and business process services, which is creating a new business unit to deliver integrated marketing, commerce, analytics and customer experience solutions.\nIn summary, Adobe demonstrated strong execution across our business in Q3. Our Creative Cloud user base continues to grow as we offer an ever-expanding stream of new Creative solutions and tailored customer offerings. Adobe Marketing Cloud had another strong quarter, and is outpacing the market from a solution, partner and customer perspective.\nContent and data have never been more important. And Adobe is the leader in both. We have become the trusted content and data partner for the world\u2019s biggest brands, media companies, governments and educational institutions. We have a strong tailwind moving into Q4 and are excited about the opportunities ahead.\nWe hope to see many of you at our MAX conference. Mark.\nMark Garrett\nIn the third quarter of FY2014, Adobe achieved revenue of $1 billion 5 million dollars (1.005 billion), within our targeted range. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.09 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.28.\nLooking at highlights in our third quarter, those that stand out include: Driving strong adoption of Creative Cloud; growing Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings well ahead of our target, managing expenses to deliver up-side on earnings per share, achieving record deferred revenue, and generating a substantial increase in recurring revenue; we exited Q3 with 63% of our revenue as recurring. \nIn Digital Media we achieved revenue of $621 million. This segment has two major components of revenue: our Creative family of products and our Document Services products. In our Creative business, adoption of Creative Cloud accelerated quarter-over-quarter while reported revenue declined sequentially as expected due to Q2 being the last quarter of any meaningful perpetual CS6 revenue. We exited Q3 with 2 million 810 thousand Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions.\nRetention of Creative Cloud subscriptions, including renewals after promotional pricing expiration, continues to track ahead of our initial projections. Across all active subscriptions, average revenue per user, or ARPU, in each Creative Cloud offering was consistent with Q2. Given continued adoption of the Photography offering and seasonal Educational strength which are adding new customers, total Creative Cloud ARPU exiting Q3 decreased slightly.\nOur success with subscriptions, Enterprise Term License Agreements or ETLAs, and Digital Publishing Suite adoption helped to drive Creative ARR to a total of $1.4 billion exiting Q3 at constant currency from December of 2013, an increase of $209 million quarter-over-quarter.\nOur strategy with segmented Creative Cloud offerings is to target existing customers across all user categories as well as attract new customers to the platform. Overall, we are seeing strength in migrating the installed base, as well as expanding our market with new user adoption.\nAdobe\u2019s direct sales force continues to migrate enterprise customers with new ETLAs, and we have a strong pipeline going into the end of the year. Creative Cloud for Team units grew sequentially on both Adobe.com and through the channel.\nSubscriptions through the channel were below our expectations in Q3 as resellers came off a strong final push with CS6 in Q2. We expect subscriptions and the associated ARR will gain momentum as the channel now focuses exclusively on Creative Cloud. Q3 adoption of the full Creative Cloud offering in the Creative Professional segment was consistent with our performance in Q2.\nOur Photoshop/Lightroom offering, which was re-branded as the Creative Cloud Photography Program in June, continues to drive new customer adoption as well as migrate those who historically licensed Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Lightroom.\nIn Document Services, we achieved revenue of $208 million in Q3. Our momentum in this category is being driven by continued adoption of Acrobat \u2013 including several large contracts which closed during the quarter. Adoption of Acrobat ETLAs, Acrobat cloud services and EchoSign grew Document Services ARR to $217 million exiting Q3.\nIn our Digital Marketing segment, there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering, and our momentum as the leader in this market continued. We achieved revenue of $290 million in Q3. More importantly, we continued to drive strong year-over-year bookings growth that puts us ahead of our goal for the year. Our success is being driven by an increase in size of transactions, number of solutions per customer, international expansion and growth in partner-driven business.\nThe second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $47 million in Q3 revenue and was consistent with our expectations. Print and Publishing segment revenue was $47 million in Q3. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies.\nAsia as a percent of total revenue was low given Creative Cloud adoption in Japan has been slower than other geographies. With the removal of perpetual licensing from the channel in Japan, we are confident the transition towards Creative Cloud will begin to accelerate.\nFrom a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX had no meaningful impact on revenue. We had $1.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY2014, versus $2.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY2014; thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue was $1.5 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $7.1 million. Comparing the $1.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY2014 to the $10.5 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY2013, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.3 million.\nIn Q3, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 29% on a GAAP basis, and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher than targeted primarily due to stronger-than-forecasted profits in the U.S. Employees at the end of Q3 totaled 12,368 versus 12,026 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 48 days, which compares to 48 days in the year-ago quarter, and 45 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $269 million in the quarter. And our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.52 billion, compared to $3.33 billion at the end of Q2.\nIn Q3, 2014, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares at a cost of $133 million. Now, I would like to go over our financial outlook. We are targeting a revenue range of $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. In Q4 we expect Digital Media segment revenue to grow sequentially \u2013 with Document Services revenue relatively consistent with the strong revenue we achieved in Q3.\nWe expect Creative ARR and Document Services ARR to grow sequentially. We expect net new Creative Cloud subscriptions to grow on a sequential basis and slightly exceed the approximately 1 million net new subscriptions we targeted in the second half of FY2014. We continue to expect we will achieve total Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.925 billion exiting the year.\nWe are targeting Q4 Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue to grow slightly on a year-over-year basis. As you think about Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue, it is important to understand we are seeing increased customer adoption of our term-based Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Campaign solutions. This is resulting in larger customer engagements, more predictable revenue as well as higher long-term revenue growth.\nIn FY2013, approximately 45% of these Marketing Cloud bookings were term-based. Entering FY2014, we anticipated a move towards a mix of approximately 60% term-based bookings in FY2014 for AEM and Campaign. With the acceleration of term-based adoption in FY2014, we anticipate achieving approximately 75% term-based bookings this year.\nAs a result of the faster transition, we estimate approximately $60 million of revenue that would have been recognized in FY2014 will have shifted from perpetual AEM and Campaign licensing to term-based contracts during the year. Adding the Q3 portion back to our results this quarter would have driven total Adobe revenue to the high-end of our targeted revenue range, and Adobe Marketing Cloud would have achieved greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3.\nAdding back the estimated Q4 impact, the high-end of our targeted Q4 revenue range would have been $1.1 billion. And adding back the $60 million full-year impact, Adobe Marketing Cloud FY2014 year-over-year revenue growth would have been greater than our annual target of 20%.\nWe highlighted at the outset of the year our goal of driving at least 25% revenue CAGR for Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue between FY2014 and FY2016 \u2013 and we\u2019re on pace to achieve this. We expect combined revenue with LiveCycle and Connect to decline sequentially; and we are targeting Print and Publishing segment revenue to be relatively flat.\nWe are targeting our Q4 share count to be 508 million to 510 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $12 million and $14 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of 28% to 29% on a GAAP and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.05 to $0.11 per share, and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.26 to $0.32.

We would now be happy to take your questions. Operator.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instruction) Your first question comes from the line of Ross Macmillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nRoss Macmillan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets\nThanks very much. Mark, the question on the mix between the full Creative Cloud and the point products this quarter I think maybe some of us thought we might see that return to a higher mix of full Creative Cloud because of the rundown of inventory of the Creative Suite from the channel. Obviously, there was some mix difference there perhaps it\u2019s explained by education strength and so forth. What is your expectation for that mix going forward and also for the blended ARPU as we think about Q4 and beyond? Thanks.\nMark Garrett\nYes, Hi Ross, like we said on the prepared remarks we feel really good about the quarter, we drove 500,000 units this a Q3 for us which is a seasonally more difficult quarter and we felt very good about how we did. We do believe there is tremendous upside in the channel. In the second quarter you saw the channel was primarily focused on kind of the last hurrah of perpetual revenue with CS6 if you will, this is the first quarter they had to sell exclusively the subscription product and we think there is a tremendous ramp that we are going to see from them contributing to that mix moving forward. Education as you know is strong in Q3 as well we had a good education quarter. And the bundle continues to attract new customers. So we are really happy with how it\u2019s progressing. We do think that the channel will be able to contribute more moving forward and that\u2019s going to help that mix and it\u2019s also going to add to ARPU over time.\nShantanu Narayen\n\nAnd Ross maybe if I were to add two other quick things when we think about excluding the PSLR bundle as well as education units, ARPU across the individual team single application as well as the complete CC in all the markets was relatively consistent in fact it increased slightly again. So we feel good about how that performance is happening. And in general you have to also go back to the Creative Suite mix that we had, single application was even in that particular business about 40%. We realize that\u2019s an on ramp that\u2019s accretive to overall ARR as Mark also mentioned with photography bundle. So pleased with how the quarter performed.\nRoss Macmillan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat\u2019s great. Maybe just one quick follow-up I know that you\u2019re seeing better retention rates than your initial 80% assumption. Will we get to a point in the near future where we might actually talk about what sort of percentage retention you\u2019re seeing? Thank you.\nShantanu Narayen\n\nWell, Ross, we told you approximately 80% we\u2019re ahead of that as we talk about in our retention rate. So we think that gives you the right color to understand that the business is very healthy. I mean other way we look at it is when you think about the number of units that we\u2019ve transacted with 2.8 million subscriptions as well as what we\u2019re doing with the enterprise ETLA that\u2019s already ahead of what we were doing steady state with Creative Suite. And we continue to think there is headroom both in terms of migrating existing customers as well as attracting new customers. So that should also give you a good sense of how healthy the business is.\nRoss Macmillan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much for taking my question.\nMark Garrett\n\nLet\u2019s take the next question, and let\u2019s try to limit to one just so we can fit everybody in. Thanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill \u2013 UBS\nThanks, good afternoon. Mark just on the Q4 guidance, you are guiding below the Street, I just want to be clear that\u2019s largely a transition to the term versus perpetual?\n\nMark Garrett\nYes, Brent. So as I pointed out upfront. In the Adobe Marketing Cloud we\u2019re seeing a much faster move to term based managed services solutions for AM and Campaign. We went into the year assuming about 60% term based mix. And we\u2019re going to end more around 75% and that delta that $60 million delta for the year is what\u2019s really driving the difference. If you look at the fourth quarter as I said we would have been closer to $1.1 billion at the high-end of our range had we not gone through a faster shift of this AM and Campaign from perpetual to term based.\n\nBrent Thill \u2013 UBS\nOkay, just a quick follow-on. And as you mentioned the Marketing Cloud bookings were well ahead of target I know you don\u2019t give out a booking number. But can you perhaps just give us some color as it relates to what you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters relative to your booking target if you significantly seen or any other color you could help us to frame that that would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nBrent, maybe I can jump in there I mean we had talked about getting 30% bookings which would drive 25% CAGR over three years. And as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks we\u2019re seeing significant strength above that particular target and maybe big picture is better to explain that. It\u2019s really in our best interest to manage and deliver the entire customer marketing platform.\nAnd what that is resulting in is we\u2019re seeing multi-year deployments. It\u2019s increasing the revenue per customer, we gave you some color on what we are seeing of deals greater than 500,000 that grew over 40%. What we\u2019re also seeing is more solutions within existing customers, which is driving stickiness. And so I think this transition to the platform the multi-solution, multi-year sale has really gone faster than expected, which hopefully is good news if you want better and more predictable revenue. And that\u2019s why we also provided you with some way to model it with what happen with AEM and Campaign for 2014.\nMark Garrett\n\nAnd then just to add on to that one more time, what that does Brent as you know, is it helps drive deferred revenue, we had a record deferred revenue quarter. It also helps drive the unbilled backlog, which we disclosed at the end of the year. And between the two of them now we\u2019ve got roughly $2 billion of contracted business waiting to be recognized in the form of revenue. So it just makes for a much healthier business over all.\nBrent Thill \u2013 UBS\nGreat, thanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.\nBrendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities\nThanks you so much. Shantanu, I was interested in where you might be seeing some of the cross sell around both the Creative Cloud and the Marketing Cloud. And you\u2019ve highlighted that at some of the conferences. Can you give us any more color on where we are in that migration and maybe a sense of \u2013 maybe what percent of the installed base is even looking at using both of those and leveraging both of each other. Thank you.\nShantanu Narayen\n\nSure. I mean I think when we look at what\u2019s happening with our enterprise sales force and the sales force that is selling both the Creative Cloud as well as the Marketing Cloud into enterprises through either ETLAs, the Document Services ETLAs as well as Marketing Cloud bookings. That\u2019s where Matt and his team are driving multiple billions of dollars in terms of what we have been able to sell.\nSome customer examples there include publishing, they want to single asset repository and workflow to create content once and repurpose that across web and mobile applications and video, which is fast becoming one of the key things for every publisher to do online, so publishing is a good industry. In retail, you\u2019re seeing more and more of the innovative customers want to completely accelerate their time to market by having the design for these goods directly delivered through this workflow all the way out to manufacturing as well as for the consumer to have the ability to actually create personalized goods directly on a retail website. And video, I think when you talk about creation, delivery and add insertion. So hopefully that gives you some examples, but it\u2019s driving more strategic relationships with customers across all of these industries.\nBrendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citibank. Your line is open.\nWalter H. Pritchard \u2013 Citibank\nJust one question Mark around pricing, you\u2019ve been in the market now for quite a while with the individual addition and you haven\u2019t talked about what percentage of your customers have gone past the one year anniversary and have had pricing go up. But can you talk about maybe an ARPU on that segment or something that would give us an idea of how many of those customers or what progress you\u2019re seeing in terms of this exploration of the promo and the uplift in ARPU that that would drive?\nMark Garrett\nWell, I mean, generally speaking like Shantanu mentioned and I think I mentioned across each of the offerings, the ARPU has either remain constant or actually increased. And from the retention perspective, we\u2019re seeing very good retention with people renewing even after the promo expires. So, as that happens of course it does drive ARPU up.\nShantanu Narayen\nAnd Walter if you go to the website and you look at the pricing for the various offerings, I think you would recognize that the individual complete is about 49.99 and you\u2019ve been look at the promotional pricing at about 29 and for team you know the complete pricing is 69.99 and promotional pricing could be 39 or 49. So, I think that gives you some sense of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of as people migrate off the promotional pricing what kind of ARPUs we are getting from those customers.\nWalter H. Pritchard \u2013 Citibank\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne \u2013 Evercore Partners\nYes, thanks very much. Mark you mentioned that the channel had a little bit of a slower start to the third quarter given that they shifted away from the license based product. I guess in your guidance for the fourth quarter. I guess how much will you counting on that bounce back to meet your subscription as well as your ARR targets for the quarter? Or do you expect it to sort of maintain itself the way it was in 2Q that\u2019s up side if you get lift on that?\nMark Garrett\nWe\u2019re expecting it to move up, I mean, we\u2019re not expecting a huge ramp, but we are expecting it to a move up from here given that they are done with the perpetual and frankly there solely focused on selling subscription now.\nShantanu Narayen\nThe other thing I might add, is if you look at the traditional Q3 to Q4 transition and you go back and look at what happened last year. The two things that drive it, first is seasonal strength, the second is enterprise ETLAs, Q4 tends to be the strong quarter for that. And so you should factor that and also as you think about how we go from Q3 ARR to adding Q4 ARR.\nKirk Materne \u2013 Evercore Partners\nThanks. If I can just add really quick follow-up to Mark\u2019s comment on the deferred being just around this quarter. Obviously, I am sure that the transition of term deals and Marketing Cloud played a part in that. Was there anything else in terms of billing, how you are billing some of your customers that quite a part that you expect to continue to go forward? Thanks.\nMark Garrett\nYes, I mean there is two big pieces really at Digital Marketing Cloud and then it\u2019s the Creative Cloud as well as, it\u2019s the ETLAs around Creative Cloud as well. ETLAs are build and advanced for the first year and that goes into deferred and then years two and three would show up in that unbilled backlog number that are referenced. So it\u2019s really both businesses that are driving the deferred revenue as well as the unbilled backlog.\nKirk Materne \u2013 Evercore Partners\nThanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nHi, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about the percentage of business from term based bookings and Marketing Cloud that has obviously caught you by surprise. Why would you not just take the step of making all the business completely right about and if you were do it I am wondering what might be a rough way to think about impact your revenue maybe if you could talk about a 10 percentage point shift in term based bookings might be X million of dollars from revenue, so we will not be at all and absolutely surprised by any development in the future.\nAnd also curious we can comment on at the time I think Shantanu likes to mention reiterate that the goal of the company is to do out to the entire installed base. At this base that which we add something looks like you could transition entire large installed base about four years to five year or so. Question is we anticipate that adding more capacity so you could even add more units than what you are doing now to enable this transition to happening with book? Thank you.\nShantanu Narayen\nSo Kash there were multiple questions in that let me address sort of that question associated with the term based as well as the perpetual from an offering point of view. There is certainly still a number of customer and we think it\u2019s a competitive advantage for us that want to have the AEM solution the experience managers as well as the campaign solution On-Premise. I mean you can think about government agencies and other agencies who want to actually managed themselves, which is why we can\u2019t completely transition from the perpetual offering to the Managed Services, which we definitely think is the right long-term solution. If you look at the trend as Mark pointed out it\u2019s moved from 45% to close to 75%.\nSo I think it\u2019s now becoming less and less and as Digital Marketing revenue grows the impact of this is certainly going to be muted. So, I think that should give you comfort as it relates to the marketing cloud, bookings and revenue on that transition.\nMark Garrett\nYes, Shantanu said exactly what I was going to say the 75%, this is the reason we wanted to tell you the 75%, because it shows that we are pretty much through this is a very quick transition the good news is it really happened much faster in the back half of the year, then we\u2019ve got with only 25% left to go and the business in total growing, as Shantanu said it\u2019s not going to have a material impact next year.\nShantanu Narayen\n\nWith respect to a second question cash Q3 was first $500,000 subscription quarter for Creative Cloud it was a couple of half million Q3, it was a strong quarter. And so I mean as we look at what\u2019s happening in the business we have both migrating existing customers, but we continue to add a healthy dose of new customers to the platform. So the strategy that we outline namely getting new customers to the platform as well as migrating continues with CS6 perpetual being strong in the last couple of quarters all of them represent available opportunity or headroom for us to move over to the cloud.\nAs do some of the countries, where we outlined that the adoption has been slightly slower. So, we\u2019re going to be focused on driving that MAX is going to be another catalyst in terms of how far to the Creative Cloud offering distances itself from the Creative Suite offering. So, we have to continue to innovate, we\u2019re focused only on the Creative Cloud as an offering in; there is still significant headroom opportunity.\n\nMark Garrett\n\nNext question.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJennifer Lowe \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nGreat, thank you. Shantanu in your remarks, you mentioned that there was thought of having more targeted offerings against the photography SKUs fees especially given success you had this I guess two questions related to that. One as you think about how those targeted SKUs fit into the traditional point versus suite, strategy, what in terms of breakpoints around packaging and pricing to go after specific use cases versus maintaining the premium ASP traditionally associated with suite is it a situation where we can see a whole spectrum of offerings or are you still working along the lines of point versus suite with a relatively big gap in between. And then related to that in terms of the time horizon that we should think about for intakes of targeted offerings is that something that will give more about next month at MAX or is that something that's going to be more of a multiyear strategy for you?\nShantanu Narayen\n\nJennifer, when I think that overall the Creative Cloud offerings in the fact that the complete offering as still we think the best solution for a Creative professional, who wants to create content for multiple kinds of media. We still believe that that\u2019s are really the right offering. Photography has always been even with the traditional Creative Suite, such a large opportunity that having the photography bundle was the right way to go target that. Part of what we are alluding to is new ARPU enhancing services that we will start to introduced and that could be to the entire Creative Cloud customer base and you will start to see some of that starting at MAX. And some of them might be even more market expansion opportunities as it relates to what consumers are trying to do and you\u2019ve seen us introduce mobile offering.\nSo I think for the core Creative professional, I think we have it right and I think we have to continue to innovative and migrating existing customers, but I think you\u2019re going to start to see us implement against the things we\u2019ve talked about the mobile SDK leading to new ARPU enhancing services for the entire base.\nJennifer Lowe \u2013 Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nHeather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGreat, thank you. I was wondering just if you could walk us through we\u2019ve heard a lot about how agencies are evolving their Digital Marketing strategies and trying to figure out how to build or whether to buy some of the ad tech that they think they need to serve their clients better, I\u2019m just wondering how you see kind of the landscape evolving on that front and how you feel Adobe, how you position Adobe in that context?\nMark Garrett\nFor Heather, first I think it\u2019s a good opportunity to reiterate that global agreement that we announced with Publicis Groupe. From my point of view Digital Marketing agencies have always been working with their key clients, Chief Marketing Officers, Chief Revenue Officers, Chief Digital Officers to demonstrate a digital strategy for media buying as well as a Creative strategy.\nI think the Creative strategy need continuous unawaited and I think all digital agencies have to continue to provide that Creative strategy and now augmented with what they\u2019re doing on the technology side to enable people to truly understand the return of investment. And move the marketing spend from just being analog to more digital. And I think again if you saw the announcement around what Publicis announced today, Digital certainly becomes a more important part of any agency\u2019s strategy.\nI think what they are also seeing honestly is that systems integrators are seeing the marketing automation is a huge untapped market and so I think they\u2019re going to see competition as it relates to the traditional systems integrators, companies like Deloitte or PWC also enter that market. And from our point of view is a technology provider none of these relationships are competitive they\u2019re all using our technology to go implement and automate marketing flows within all traditional industries.\nTo give you some color, relationship with Publicis allows them to use our technology to do automated search spin or social spin or display using our technology it allows the company like Razorfish that\u2019s part of the Publicis Groupe to go ahead and implement re-platforming associated with websites, it also allows them honestly to now with our audience manager solution have a way to segment both the online and offline customers, which is a big part of how they want to target their offering. So, we\u2019re excited about that and where its agencies or SIs expect to see more people want to partner with Adobe.\nHeather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGreat, thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.\nMark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC\nThank you very much. I would like to have Mark fill a little more on the $16 million. Should we be thinking of this move to 75% being term agreements does it simply mean that we get the license revenue is ratably recognized over the contract term where is there a revenue lift during the first contractor. So, obviously that\u2019s a lift after the first contract. And then a quick follow-up on that?\nMark Garrett\nHey, Mark, yes, its $60 million just to make sure everybody heard that right 60, and it\u2019s recognized ratably over the contract term for the most part. So, it is spread out typically their multiyear deals and its spread out over that multiyear period.\nMark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC\nBut this is not \u2013 it\u2019s not a move in the first contract term it\u2019s not more revenue and just ratably recognized and then potentially is more revenue for second contract?\nMark Garrett\nCorrect.\nMark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC\nOkay. And then the quick follow-up to that keep you online. Are you now selling still selling the same mix of term versus perpetual in this space are you now basically the predominantly selling the term and agreements?\nMark Garrett\nYes, by far we\u2019re now predominately selling the term agreement. So the 75% that will end the year at, like I said, only reads 25% of perpetual. So it\u2019s not going to be material shift in any given quarter moving forward now.\nMark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Derric Wood from Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJ.Derric Wood, CFA \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP\nYou guys talked about Japan being a little weaker than expected, I guess how do you weigh the impact potentially coming from the macro versus the impact coming from kind of the shifting channel focus around Creative Cloud. And then how does that kind of baked into your expectations for Japan next quarter and looking your pipeline and sub add contribution?\nShantanu Narayen\nFor my point of view I think Japan continues to be large untapped opportunity for Creative Cloud. It\u2019s been a traditional strength for us with the Creative products when we had the Creative Suite offering. I think was a little bit about that geography is the large dependency on our retail in that and we had the retail product in Q2, we see early adapters and we think there is untapped opportunity associated with the Japanese market. So nothing changes our long term view and it\u2019s not a demand issue.\nMark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC\nThank you\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Robert Breza from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.\nRobert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.\n\nHi and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch back onto the $6 million market, So if you think about the remaining 25% do you think that\u2019s a \u2013 how should we think about that transition, I know you are saying it shouldn\u2019t be a big part, but do you think that moves to 80% by the end of FY2015 or how do you think that this trends longer term?\nMark Garrett\nI think that the 75 continue to group up a little bit I think we will get a point where it stops frankly and we are getting close to that. It\u2019s a little hard to say exactly where, but yes I could see it going up to 80, 20 or something like that over the course of next year. it going to depend in any given quarter on how the booking come in and who the customer are, Shantanu said certain customers want the perpetual version, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get the point where it moves the needle in term of our total company revenue like it has back half of this year.\nRobert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.\n\nOkay maybe as a quick follow, given the strong deferred revenue number that you guys did put up. I mean it\u2019s hard to quantify certainly what growth that - part of that being more of this $60 million to a term based fees or overall strength of the demanded, just qualitative commentary would be helpful? Thanks.\nMark Garrett\nYes, that the $60 million represents multi-year contraction, so a big chunk of the \u2013 well the $60 million is the impact to this year, but the bookings that that drove will get recognized over time under a term based model and that would show up in next year\u2019s revenue on a ratable basis, the first years would be in differed and years two and three of those booking would be in unbilled.\nRobert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.\n\nGreat thank you very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open.\nJay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.\nShantanu you marked other than highlighting the momentum you are seeing for EM and for campaign, could you talk otherwise in term of what you are seeing for the other components of marketing class specifically to a example maybe optimizer which you have highlighted in the past as particularly strong new product for you and perhaps update us as well on the number of solution that customer are thinking on the average. I believe the last time you updated that was six months ago at Salt Lake where it was 1.4 solutions to the customer, an update in that respect and then I could follow-up?\nShantanu Narayen\nYes, Sure Jay I mean in term of the solutions what we were trying to do was highlight the key differentiation that we had. And the differentiation is still very much the combination of experience manager plus analytics. Campaign has been doing really well, after the acquisition of Campaign it\u2019s got really good analyst reviews as well as customer adoption. So Campaign is off to a solid start.\nMedia Optimizer the amount of marketing spend on the management continues to grow, I would say target has been doing really well, we\u2019ve seen significant growth year-over-year as the ability to offer personalized solutions really increases. And so when I look at it \u2013 the way we look at that business as both new sales which are largely multi-solution sales as well as existing installed customer base and how we can continue to sell existing customers on more and more of our solutions. And when you think about the number of large deals again as we said that grew 40% year-over-year. So, overall I think people are standardizing on our platform, the usage starts always pretty much with AEM plus analytics and now Campaign as a third leg of that.\nRobert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.\nOkay. And lastly for Mark, just a clarification from the earlier questions on retention or renewal rates, now that we\u2019ve had 10 quarters at Creative Cloud behind those. Could you talk a little bit more about the cohort turn of the original class from 2012, let\u2019s say or early 2013 in terms of their retention rates to go back eight, nine, ten quarters. How does that retention look?\nMark Garrett\n\nYes, so Jay, we can\u2019t kind of get into that level of detail here, but the bottom line is like I said from a retention perspective people are renewing after the promotion along the lines of what we would had expected it\u2019s not even better than we had expected. All I\u2019m chatting here, one thing I try to be very clear about the impact of the Digital Marketing shift from perpetual to term. I think we laid it out at the end of my prepared remarks really well. So if you any questions please refer back to that paragraph and then we can do some more follow-up phone calls, because we try to lay it out exactly as we had in the past under the Creative transition.\nShantanu Narayen\n\nNext question.\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, & Co., Inc.\nHi thanks for taking my question, I wanted to ask you about ELA that you kind of after a little bit over a year now. What has existed in upselling that in the installed base and how is the integration we put there, rest of the Marketing Cloud going for that, that\u2019s sort of products?\nShantanu Narayen\n\nReally well. That\u2019s the solution that we now call Adobe Campaign. Adobe Campaign had another strong quarter in Q3 pipeline looks great for Q4. And the ability to orchestrate these multiple Campaigns across the web, e-mail, SMS outside the U.S. which is pretty strong, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of Campaign so far.\nSamad Samana \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, & Co., Inc.\n\nAnd have you seen any change in the competitive environment? ExactTarget with Salesforce for a while now and their customers acquire it for renewals. Has there been any change in the competitive environment in the marketing space for you guys?\nMark Garrett\n\nWell, I think from a competitive point of view as this market continues to explode, you\u2019re seeing everybody participating that we still think we\u2019re the leader in the category and our solutions are most differentiated. And we continue to grow that by both expanding our footprint, so specifically as it relates to ExactTarget versus Campaign. A lot of the Campaign solutions for us right now are Greenfield opportunities as people are continuing to implement and automate their marketing processes. So we\u2019ve been focused a lot of that.\nSamad Samana \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, & Co., Inc.\nOkay, thanks.\nMark Garrett\n\nOperator we\u2019re coming up on the hour, so maybe we\u2019ll take one more question.\nOperator\nYour final question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert Baird. Your line is open.\nSteve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird.\nHi, thanks very much for speaking again. Hey, I just wanted to swing back to the Digital Marketing business. Again you talked about the nice increase at the number of larger deals that\u2019s happening there since you introduced platform and I was hoping to get more color over how you\u2019re driving that is that coming from you going back to the installed base and cross-selling multiple solutions into existing customers. Or is that also coming from new customers buying more solutions when they initially buy and where you're getting kind of traction of bundles expect?\nShantanu Narayen\n\nSteve, the short answer is actually its both, its both and its happening both through our direct salesforce and honestly its happening through partners who are increasingly recommending us as the solution of choice as they going to all of these digital transformation products. Again, I would say till two quarters ago it was largely driven by the combination of AEM and analytics. And then the cross-sell was media optimizer and social and target.\nToday I would say the initial sale is much more AEM plus analytics plus Campaign because that\u2019s being very well received. And then the upsells continue to be those other solutions. In terms of industries retail continues to be really strong, automotive is strong, financial services is doing well. Government as government does digital government we\u2019ve had a really strong presence with AEM and analytics and government as well as document security there. So, we\u2019re seeing trend good positive trend across every industry. There isn\u2019t a CMO in the world that I go to who is and talking about digital transformation and trying to understand how technology helps them. So I think it\u2019s that tremendous tailwind, Steve.\nSteve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird.\nThat\u2019s really helpful. Thank you, Shantanu.\nShantanu Narayen\nWell, thanks for joining us, I mean, I think as I think about all of the questions I do want to reiterate what\u2019s traditionally being a weak quarter for Adobe Q3, we really have strong performance both with subscriber additions over $0.5 million, Digital Marketing bookings that was strong as well as Document Services revenue in Q3. And as a result we\u2019re on track to deliver the key financial commitments that we outline for the second half of the year. On the Creative Cloud it still is how do we drive customer adoption and migration to Creative Cloud. Adobe.com has been focused on this for a couple of years and now the entire channel ecosystem as well ELTAs through the enterprise we\u2019re focused on this.\nIn Digital Marketing I would say awareness has being growing, we continue to drive leadership with successful product launches of our marketing products. The fact that we\u2019re seeing this shift from perpetual to term, we view that as a real positive, because people are shining these large multiyear agreements with us.\nOn the internal side, the innovation engine is humming. We\u2019re delivering new value with Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud as well as Document Services. And I think the earnings upside continues to demonstrate the leverage of our financial model. We are excited about MAX and we look forward to seeing you there. Thank you for joining us.\nMike Saviage\nAnd this concludes our call. Thanks for joining us.\n\n",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would like to introduce your host for today's conference Scott Frommer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nScott Frommer - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nGood morning, and welcome to LabCorp's first quarter 2018 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Gary Huff, CEO of LabCorp Diagnostics; and John Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development.\nIn addition to our press release, we also furnished Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.\nFinally, we are making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to statements with respect to 2018 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on operating and financial results, and the opportunities for future growth.\nThese statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.\nNow, I'll turn the call over to Dave King.\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nThank you, Scott, and good morning. We are off to an impressive start in 2018, once again demonstrating the power of our integrated growth platform. The combination of accelerating organic revenue growth and drug development, strong organic growth in diagnostics despite headwinds from PAMA and weather, and acquisition contributions from both businesses yielded year-over-year revenue growth of 18%.\nThis top line performance along with the benefits from our LaunchPad initiative and tax reform translated into adjusted EPS growth of 31%. We expanded margins significantly in Covance and held them for the enterprise. In addition, we fully deployed our free cash flow through share repurchases and a one-time bonus payment to non-bonus-eligible colleagues as a result of tax reform. We are very pleased with our operating performance during the quarter.\nOur results reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, ASC 606. Although ASC 606 has no impact on our cash flow, we estimate that it will lower our full year 2018 adjusted EPS by approximately $0.20 to $0.30, which Glenn will discuss in more detail.\nI want to stress that we are nevertheless maintaining our full year guidance despite this development because our strong first quarter performance, outlook for the balance of the year and progress on key strategic initiatives give us confidence that we will overcome this impact, which is merely due to the accounting change.\nAs we said early in the year, to achieve our guidance, we are relentlessly focused on execution of three priorities: driving profitable growth, integrating key acquisitions and optimizing enterprise margins. We are driving profitable growth by capitalizing on strong customer demand for our differentiated capabilities and strategically investing in new offerings for future growth.\nIn Drug Development, our investments in people, solutions, technology, therapeutic expertise and infrastructure are resonating with our customers. The objective evidence is another quarter of strong net orders and book-to-bill. Independent evidence comes from a survey of biopharma customers conducted by the Life Science Strategy Group and William Blair, in which Covance was recognized as far away the most improved CRO over the past year. As John Ratliff memorably told me last year, quite simply, we are winning in the market.\nIn Diagnostics, our focus on Women's Health and Medical Drug Monitoring as well as our strategic collaboration with 23andMe contributed to market-leading organic growth. The increased volume helped mitigate the impact from lower reimbursement rates related to PAMA. There are multiple growth opportunities in Diagnostics and we will continue to deploy capital judiciously to maximize the return on our growth investments.\nOur second priority for 2018 is integrating key acquisitions flawlessly. The integration of Chiltern is largely complete, benefiting customers of both Chiltern and Covance. We have preserved the high-touch customized experience that Chiltern's biotech and emerging pharma customers require while strengthening both Chiltern and Covance's scale, therapeutic expertise and capabilities. In Diagnostics, we continue to demonstrate the value of our be selective and go deep strategy as partnerships with major health systems such as Mount Sinai and PAML expand to new services and initiatives.\nOur third priority in 2018 is optimizing our enterprise margins. Besides profitable revenue growth and acquisition integration, our LaunchPad improvement process initiative in both businesses is critical to achieving this goal. LaunchPad centers on fundamentally reengineering service delivery to improve the customer experience while sustainably enhancing margins.\nDuring the quarter, we opened a Covance central delivery center in Bangalore, India, an important milestone toward expanding our global service delivery model. Global service delivery enhances our proficiencies by standardizing processes and procedures, automating workflows and creating a global platform to reduce expenses and support long-term growth. The impact of Covance LaunchPad is clear in significant Covance margin improvement versus last year.\nIn addition to focusing on these three 2018 priorities, we are also capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities provided by our powerful combination of leading Diagnostics and Drug Development businesses. At our Investor and Analyst Day in February, we identified three strategic initiatives \u2013 supporting our customers' transition to value-based care, enhancing the drug development process and creating a leading consumer engagement platform.\nI will now discuss highlights of these areas during the quarter. We entered into a comprehensive laboratory collaboration with Appalachian Regional Healthcare, an 11-hospital health system in Kentucky and West Virginia. We expanded our relationship with Mount Sinai to consolidate all of their reference work and streamline their inpatient labs. We delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth in companion diagnostics, and Covance's backlog in this area now exceeds $300 million. We continue to offer customers the unique ability to develop companion diagnostics as lab-developed tests or in collaboration with manufacturers as IVDs [In-Vitro Diagnostics].\nWe are in the process of finalizing an arrangement to offer companion diagnostics globally to meet the requirements of our biopharma customers who wish to sell their medicines outside the United States. We announced a strategic technology agreement with GlaxoSmithKline that covers several Xcellerate modules on a Software-as-a-Service basis including Covance's proprietary risk-based monitoring solution. This software allows sponsors to strategically guide site monitoring resources from trial commencement to completion.\nWe announced the next step in our LabCorp Walgreens initiative with the opening of 10 patient service centers in Walgreens stores in Florida. Physician and consumer response to the LabCorp Walgreens experience has been outstanding, and we continue to attract new patients to these sites. This quarter, we expect to bring our testing services to consumers' homes through our innovative at-home self-collection testing device. This device will be validated to provide results equivalent to a venous blood draw, assuring LabCorp quality and reliability in another new channel.\nLabCorp Express, our differentiated consumer checking kiosk, is now available in more than 600 patient service centers. Feedback on this proprietary tool continues to be extremely positive, and we remain on track to install the capability in all of our patient service centers by year end. We released the LabCorp patient mobile app for download by consumers at various app stores as an additional option to the currently available Patient Portal. These innovations increase consumer engagement, capture more accurate demographic and insurance information, and create efficiencies in patient service center workflow.\nIn closing, we are off to a terrific start in 2018. Through sharp focus on our key priorities in Diagnostics and Drug Development combined with important strategic accomplishments, we delivered impressive growth and continued to create shareholder value.\nWe are the world's largest laboratory by revenue and global reach, but we are more than the world's largest laboratory. We are a global leader in life sciences. We offer real solutions beyond lab and beyond CRO, and we provide unique and differentiated value to consumers, physicians, health systems, managed care, and biopharma partners. We could not accomplish these things without the commitment and contributions of nearly 60,000 colleagues around the globe. They dedicate themselves every day to our mission to improve health and improve lives and make all of our current and future successes possible. We are all confident that the future ahead is bright.\nNow, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nThank you, Dave. My comments today will focus on the company's first quarter results as well as provide an update on our 2018 guidance. However, I'll start off with a discussion of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, ASC 606, given its impact on our numbers.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method, meaning that we restated our 2017 financial results to better enable evaluation of our 2018 performance and guidance. In the press release, our prepared remarks, and the Q&A session to follow, all references to our 2017 results are to the restated numbers unless we specifically advise you otherwise. In the back of the press release, we provided tables that include our full-year 2017 results as well as our first quarter 2018 and 2017 results under both ASC 606 and the prior accounting standard, ASC 605. We also provided additional related information on Form 8-K furnished this morning.\nAs you can see from the tables, the net impact for the enterprise is that the company's full-year 2017 revenues increased by $102 million, or 1%, compared to the prior accounting standard. Our adjusted operating income decreased $56 million or 3% from the prior accounting standard because the inclusion of investigator fees and other pass-through expenses changes the underlying percentage of completion calculation used to recognize revenue. The new accounting standard has the effect of deferring these earnings into future periods. As a result, earnings per share in 2017 decreased $0.35 or 4%. There was no impact on cash flow.\nFurthermore, ASC 606 affects our businesses differently. For Diagnostics, the new standard requires us to treat bad debt as a reduction to revenue rather than as an SG&A expense, meaning our revenue is lower but our operating income does not change. Our reported margins therefore are higher. Specifically, as seen in the table in the back of the press release, for the first quarter, revenue under current accounting was lower by $85 million compared to the prior accounting method. There was no change in operating income. And as a result, margins are now 90 basis points higher.\nFor Drug Development, the new standard requires us to add investigator fees and other pass-through expenses to both revenue and expense. As a result of the increases in both revenue and expense, our reported margins are lower. In addition, these investigator fees and other pass-through expenses, which are tied to our clinical services business, now affect the timing of revenue recognition over the life of the contracts because these expenses tend to be incurred later in the contract life. To be clear, the total earnings of the contracts do not change, only the timing of when they are recognized.\nWe have reviewed all of the Drug Development business's contracts, more than 800 that are affected by this new standard. For the first quarter, Drug Development revenues under current accounting increased by $196 million compared to the prior accounting method. Operating income decreased by $7 million, resulting in a 300 basis point decline in margin.\nPutting it all together, our consolidated revenue in the first quarter increased by $110 million or 4% compared to the prior accounting standard, while our operating income declined by $7 million or 1%, resulting in lower adjusted EPS of $0.05 or 2%.\nTo wrap up on the accounting discussion, a couple of key points worth noting. First, although the numbers look a bit different, the company's strong operating performance and its improving trends year over year are clear under both accounting methodologies. Second, ASC 606 has no impact on cash flow.\nWith that, I'll review our first quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, an increase of 18% over last year, as acquisitions added 13.4%, organic revenue increased 3.2%, and we benefited from foreign currency translation of 150 basis points. Operating income for the quarter was $305 million or 10.7% of revenue compared to $318 million or 13.2% last year. During the quarter, we had $68 million of restructuring charges and special items primarily related to acquisition integration and the one-time bonus to non-bonus-eligible employees due to the benefit from tax reform.\nAdjusted operating income, which excludes amortization, restructuring charges, and special items, was $436 million or 15.3% of revenue compared to $377 million or 15.6% last year. The $59 million increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and savings from our LaunchPad business process improvement initiative, partially offset by lower Medicare reimbursement as a result of the implementation of PAMA [Protecting Access to Medicare Act]. The 30 basis point decline in operating margin was due to the mix impact from acquisitions.\nThe tax rate for the quarter was 28.6% compared to 30.9% last year. The adjusted tax rate excluding special charges and amortization was 22.9%, down from 31.3% last year. This lower rate was due to the implementation of tax reform in the U.S. We continue to expect the full year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%, as the first quarter rate of 22.9% came in as expected due to the benefit of stock vesting.\nStrong operational performance and the benefit of tax reform translated into net earnings for the quarter of $173 million or $1.67 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which excludes amortization, restructuring charges and other special items, were $2.78 in the quarter, up 31% over last year.\nOperating cash flow was $155 million in the quarter compared to $226 million a year ago. The reduction was primarily driven by the one-time bonus payment related to tax reform and higher working capital to support growth, partially offset by higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $73 million or 2.5% of revenue compared to $72 million or 3% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $82 million in the quarter compared to $154 million last year.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $75 million of stock. As of March 31, we had $326 million of authorization remaining under our previously approved share repurchase program. On April 24, the board authorized an increase in the company's share repurchase program to a total of $1 billion demonstrating our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders.\nOur cash balance as of March 31 was $362 million, up from $317 million at the end of 2017. And total debt was $6.8 billion, unchanged from last quarter. The company's leverage at the end of the quarter remained at 3.3 times gross debt to restated last 12 months' pro forma EBITDA.\nNow, I'll review our segment performance beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, an increase of 8% over the last year. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by acquisitions, organic volume measured by requisitions and the benefit from currency translation of approximately 30 basis points, partially offset by the negative impact from PAMA.\nRevenue per requisition increased 0.7% due to acquisitions, partially offset by the impact from PAMA. Total volume increased 6.9%, of which organic volume was 3% and acquisition volume was 3.9%. In addition, volume growth was negatively impacted by approximately 1% due to adverse weather.\nLabCorp Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $364 million or 20.6% of revenue compared to $342 million or 20.8% last year. The $22 million increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to acquisitions and strong organic revenue growth. In addition, the negative impact from adverse weather was mostly offset by a favorable legal settlement in the quarter. The decline in operating margin was due to the negative impact from PAMA, partially offset by strong revenue growth.\nNow, I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 39% over last year due to acquisitions, accelerated organic growth and the benefit from 390 basis points of foreign currency translation. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $108 million or 10% of revenue compared to $68 million or 8.8% last year. The $40 million increase in operating income was due to organic demand, LaunchPad savings and acquisitions. The 120 basis point improvement in margin was primarily driven by organic demand and LaunchPad savings. We remain on track to deliver $150 million of net savings from Covance LaunchPad and $30 million of cost synergies from the integration of Chiltern by the end of 2020.\nDrug Development delivered another strong quarter of net orders and net book-to-bill. For the trailing 12 months, net orders were $4.8 billion, translating into a net book-to-bill of 1.29 times. These results compared to trailing 12 months' net orders and net book-to-bill of $4.6 billion and 1.34 times respectively as of December 31, 2017. Backlog at the end of the quarter increased to $9.2 billion, up from $8.7 billion at the end of 2017. And we expect approximately $3.7 billion of this backlog to convert into revenues over the next 12 months.\nNow, I'll discuss our 2018 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates as of March 31 for the remainder of the year and includes the impacts from currently anticipated deployment of free cash flow towards acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. And as a reminder, all 2017 results mentioned in the guidance are restated in light of ASC 606. We expect revenue growth of 10% to 12% over 2017 revenue of $10.3 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 90 basis points of currency translation. This is an increase over our prior guidance of 9.5% to 11% due to strong organic growth and favorable currency translation.\nWe expect LabCorp Diagnostics' revenue growth of 3.5% to 5.5% over 2017 revenue of $6.9 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 20 basis points of currency translation. This is an increase over our prior guidance of 3% to 5% primarily due to strong organic growth.\nWe expect Covance Drug Development revenue growth of 21% to 25% over 2017 revenue of $3.5 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 230 basis points of currency translation. This is an increase of our prior guidance of 20% to 24% due to favorable currency translation. We remain on track to deliver mid- to high-single-digit organic growth in 2018 across our businesses.\nOur adjusted EPS guidance is $11.30 to $11.70, an increase of 22% to 26% over adjusted EPS in 2017 of $9.25. This range is unchanged from our prior guidance. However, it now includes the projected negative impact from ASC 606 for the full year in 2018 of $0.20 to $0.30 per share whereas our prior guidance assumed no EPS impact from the accounting change. We expect to offset this reduction in earnings due to the new accounting standard through our strong first quarter results and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year.\nWe expect free cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, unchanged from prior guidance.\nThis concludes our formal remarks, and now we'll take questions. Operator?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nRoss Muken - Evercore Group LLC\nHi, good morning, gentlemen. So on the lab side, the volume number really stuck out to me particularly on the organic side, given most of the other results we've seen across kind of healthcare this quarter, it doesn't seem like there was a huge shift in utilization and so it feels like you guys are kind of outperforming there. I know you called out 23andMe, and that's worked well for you. But can you give us just some context for how you've been able to sustain kind of this more elevated rate particularly in the face of some of the weather issues we saw and just how that's sort of likely to trend over the balance of the year just in terms of the rest of the cadence?\nGary M. Huff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nSure, Ross. Good morning. This is Gary Huff. First of all, we are pleased with the 3% organic volume growth for the quarter despite the weather. This was really driven by strength in Women's Health, 23andMe, as well as our Medical Drug Monitoring. And I will tell you we continue to expect low-single-digit volume growth for the remainder of the year. And one of the reasons why we believe in our growth organically is due to the fact of our organization's focus we started. If you were at the Investor Day, you saw that we had a significant focus on oncology, genetics, Medical Drug Monitoring, as well as Women's Health and 23andMe.\nAnd so the organization is very focused. We have a great commercial organization that is focused. And in addition to that, the entire organization, from our couriers to our phlebotomists, our lab, our people across the organization are focused on profitable \u2013 driving profitable growth in the organization, but also delivering value in terms of high-quality results and solutions to our customers, and that is proving out to do very well for us.\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nRoss, it's Dave. I would just add, part of it is the integrated sale to the physicians' office, particularly the OB/GYN and primary care around Women's Health, around genetics, around Sequenom. So I think we have a very comprehensive set of services, and we're offering them in a way that is attractive to the customer and highlights the one-stop shop opportunity that really makes us differentiated.\nRoss Muken - Evercore Group LLC\nExcellent. And just on the guide, can you just give us a feel for how you're able to kind of manage through that $0.20 to $0.30 headwind because that's pretty significant relative to what we were first contemplating and tease out a bit where in the P&L you sort of had the confidence that that will sort of carry through for the rest of the year? I mean, obviously, you beat the Q1 number, but you still have quite a bit left to go in the year, and that's a reasonable step-up. And so is it really on the margin side where you've got some flexibility or were there other elements kind of contemplated on capital deployment, et cetera?\nGlenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nHey, Ross. This is Glenn. To your point that the growth that we experienced in the first quarter organically, margin improvement through our LaunchPad initiative was all coming through. We had a very strong first quarter. As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to see a good outlook, better organic revenue. You saw that we bumped up our guidance, if you will, and revenue within our Diagnostics business. We also did have the benefit of favorable currency in the quarter, and the outlook for the year contributes as well. But overall, we're feeling pretty bullish about our businesses and it's reflected in our guidance.\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nAnd Ross, it's Dave again. Just the acquisitions are outperforming our preliminary view of them when we made the acquisitions that applies to PAML, that applies to Chiltern. So those will annualize at some point, but we still feel this underlying performance in the business is very strong and gives us confidence that we'll be able to offset the impact of this accounting change.\nRoss Muken - Evercore Group LLC\nHelpful, Dave. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nLisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nThanks very much. Good morning. Dave, you commented that on a combined basis, you're seeing accelerated growth versus what either company could do on a standalone basis. Is there any way to quantify that? I mean is there contracts that you've won or something that we can look to from our side to better understand that?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nGood morning, Lisa. I think that it sort of sounds like a circular answer, but it's not. I mean I think you just have to look at the results. You look in particular at the progression in Covance of the book-to-bill, the net orders and the backlog. Obviously, a lot of that is due to good leadership, and it's due to strong operational improvement, but it's also due to the LabCorp capabilities that we bring around companion diagnostics. It's due to the LabCorp capabilities that we bring around data and recruitment.\nBy the same token, you look at the strong LabCorp performance and again the numbers speak for themselves, but underneath that is the Covance capabilities that we bring to health systems with patient recruitment, the Covance capabilities that we bring with access to trials and cutting edge medications, not only in major academic centers but in health systems that have rural delivery \u2013 that deliver services in rural settings where the patients otherwise might not be able to access cutting edge medicines for acute conditions like advanced cancer, and so we bring something that is different and something that is attractive.\nSo again, I think the numbers are the best reference point, but I also think those numbers would not be achievable without the combination of the two capabilities. And if you look at the performance of peers, you see that our numbers are better, and they're better because of the combination.\nLisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nSo if we think about this, if we look at peers and look at your number, is it fair to say the growth rate that you have that's incremental versus a peer potentially comes from that combination or is it really hard to quantify?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nI think it's very hard to quantify. Again, we can talk about specific contracts in Covance that we won because of the LabCorp data. We can talk about specific companion diagnostics contracts that we've won in Covance because of the LabCorp capabilities and the dedicated laboratory. But it's going to be hard to put a number on it other than to say I go back to the outperformances for a reason, and it's great people, it's great talent, it's great leadership, but it's also the value of the combined organization and the global scale and reach.\nLisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nGreat. And then, Glenn, I know you said that the legal settlement helped to offset weather in the quarter. But is there a way to quantify what the legal settlement was, one; and two, what it was for?\nGlenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nI'll take the first part, which is the financial impact. We've talked about it mostly offsetting the adverse impact from weather, and we did quantify that at around 1% impact on volume. So the adverse weather, call it, is around $10 million of operating income. And so we talked about that the legal settlement essentially is at least mostly offsetting it, so it gives you the magnitude or the range of what that number would be as well.\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nAnd, Lisa, it's Dave. We can't comment on what the legal settlement is for due to confidentiality. But again, it's one of those things where we incurred some legal liability, and we were able to recoup some of that liability through the settlement.\nLisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nOkay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nJack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nThanks, good morning. So I wanted to focus on Covance. What was organic growth in the quarter? Can you talk about bookings, how they compared to under the prior methodology? And then finally, in early development, are you seeing any new opportunities given consolidation and other factors impacting some of the smaller players?\nJohn D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nSure, I'll take that, Jack. This is John Ratliff. In terms of book-to-bill and the actual ED and then finally getting into the other part, book-to-bill in the 8-K shows we were in the old methodology at about 1.36 times, and then in terms of now 1.34 times. That's over the last 12 months. Under the new, it was 1.34 times going to 1.29 times. The key here is strong operating performance no matter what view you take. And so that's even with annualizing probably our strongest quarter last year. So significant strength across each of the segments, early development, as well as in the labs as well as the clinical.\nAs to the revenue, it's consistent with our guidance that we gave for the year in the single-high to mid-digit growth, and so showing actual accelerated growth in all the segments of the business.\nAnd then finally, in terms of the early development business, we're seeing actual real strength in terms of the safety assessment, metabolic lead optimization as well as the chemistry areas, accelerating momentum organically and actually adding capacity in certain areas, as we've actually given visibility to, as an example, the CMC area, but also adding capacity within our present facilities, so seeing the biopharma area, showing the biotech area showing real strength underneath and a significant participant in our backlog.\nJack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nThanks, John. And then in terms of the data strategy, any updates on how the Walgreens collaboration could benefit Xcellerate and any update on how the check-in tool is impacting patient opt-ins?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nJack, it's Dave. So the check-in tool is being introduced into the Walgreens environment as we move to the next set of stores, and we're optimistic that it will support an increase in opt-ins. We're talking about a number of what we think are very attractive options to expand the things that we're doing with Walgreens beyond just the drawing of blood in the stores. And we'll have more to say about that probably over the next couple of quarters opposed to this morning.\nJack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nThanks, Dave.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nErin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC\nGreat, thanks. Could you speak to any of the nuances in test mix I guess that may have influenced that revenue per requisition? And can you speak to how sustainable that trend is? Thanks.\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nErin, it's Dave. So MDM and Women's Health are probably on average at a slightly higher price point than our average test mix, which would give us a little bit of positive impact. 23andMe, as we've said, is below our average price point. I think it's important to remember, however, that when you think about 23andMe, also think about the fact that we don't do a blood draw, we don't do logistics, we don't do the typical things that we would do in procuring a specimen. So even though it's below our average price point, that is not in any way to suggest that it's not great business for us because it's terrific business. So what you get in the total mix is you get up from Women's Health, up from Medical Drug Monitoring, up from Genetics and Oncology, with some offset from 23andMe. And that's why we mix to the 70 basis points positive.\nErin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC\nOkay, great. And then on the Covance side of the business, if you could, comment on general RFP flow more on the clinical side. And were there any significant cancellations or anomalies that you would call out? Thanks.\nJohn D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nSure. The amount of proposals is consistent with past quarters, very nice proposal flow. And in terms of cancellations, we're within the range that we've seen in the past. There's nothing abnormal about that.\nErin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC\nOkay, great. Thank you.\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nErin, Dave. Just one more thing, I should also have mentioned. I think it's obvious, but nonetheless I should have mentioned that PAMA has an impact on revenue per requisition this quarter in the year-over-year comparison.\nErin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC\nGreat, thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nGreat, thanks, maybe just one on the United contract. I know last quarter, you said you were having accelerated conversations with them. I'm just wondering, an update there, any thoughts on timing, how we should be thinking about that one.\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nGood morning, Patrick. It's Dave. We continue to be involved extensively and consistently with United. And as soon as we have something to tell you about, we absolutely will tell you about it.\nPatrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nFair enough. And then just on capital allocation, how are you guys feeling about the M&A pipeline? Do you see more activity on the lab side now that PAMA has been out there for a few months? And how should we be thinking about lab versus CRO for your M&A?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nIt's Dave again. I would say on the PAMA side, there's certainly activity in the pipeline. There's certainly engagement of a number of parties that are looking at their options. At the same time, we have to recognize that we as LabCorp and the industry through ACLA [American Clinical Laboratory Association] and our industry colleagues have been working very aggressively both within the court system and with the legislative system to try to fix the error that CMS made with PAMA, and so I think there's some watchful waiting in terms of what's going to really happen before we see a strong pickup in activity.\nIn terms of the allocation of resources, I would just repeat what we have said previously, which is we're fortunate that we generated significant cash flow. We're going to deploy that cash flow judiciously. We look at every deal individually. There's no bias toward the CRO side or the lab side. We look at every deal individually in terms of what is the best deployment of capital, where are we going to achieve the best return. Both of the organizations are in the process of significant integration activity. And obviously, you saw we announced yesterday that we've expanded the partnership with Mount Sinai to do more things with them. So we don't have a bias. We will continue to be active in M&A, and we're going to look at where we can achieve the best return on the dollars we're investing.\nPatrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nGreat, thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAmanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC\nHi. Good morning. I actually had a couple of questions on the CDx side. So I guess, first, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your plans. You mentioned plans to expand globally. Is that with specific partners? And how would we think about where the testing is done, regulatory dynamics? Maybe just some more color there would be helpful.\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nAmanda, it's Dave. It would be with partner or partners. And it would involve performing the testing outside the U.S., but obviously in environments where we felt comfortable with all the things like quality, reproducibility, laboratory certification. And it would involve in all likelihood sharing of our operating procedures and processes for performing the testing. So as you know, the biopharmaceutical companies see large markets for some of these companion diagnostics outside the United \u2013 or some of the therapeutics outside the United States, and we want to be able to provide the companion diagnostic testing that's associated with.\nAmanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC\nOkay. Got it. And it feels like there's momentum shift on the CDx side for various reasons. Obviously, the MCD that was just published by Medicare, but I'm curious how your pharma partners are thinking about it. So you've got some that are maybe focused more on an all-comer-type strategy, some are thinking about it more from a segmented perspective. So just curious how you think about that just in terms of pre-market or clinical trials versus post-market, are your pharma partners interested in pursuing markers more generally at this point just given the pipeline?\nJohn D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nI'd say yes to the very last point. We're seeing that extensively through chiefly both on the post-marketing side as well as in really the Phase II up. And so almost every discussion, every partnering discussion we're having that extensive capability review even at the early Phase II timeframe. But clearly we're seeing strength. We believe we're seeing the majority of the market, and that's why you're seeing our backlogs and our order rate go up by a factor of 3 and 4x from the time of the LabCorp acquisition of Covance. So we're seeing it in both areas, both the post-marketing area as well as in the Phase II/III, and pharma is extensively looking at the biomarker space and the capabilities in terms of the companion diagnostics with respect to the partnering \u2013 strategic partnering of Covance and themselves.\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nAnd it's Dave. I'll just add, beyond the dedicated companion diagnostics laboratory and our goal of achieving global delivery, we also have resourced a biomarker center of excellence within Covance to collaborate with pharma partners, and that is supported obviously by all the biomarker where we've historically done at LabCorp. So again, it's just another example of how the combination adds more to our service offerings than either of us would have alone.\nAmanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC\nOkay, thanks very much.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is now open.\nKevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC\nGood morning. Dave, I have two quick questions for you. First one, you gave a good detail to Erin on the revenue per requisition increase, but I don't think you guys have stated what the impact of PAMA was this quarter. Could you give us that?\nGlenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nYeah. This is Glenn. We've talked about that the impact of PAMA for the year was going to be roughly around $70 million, and it is we expected and actually we experienced in the first quarter pretty close to being kind of pro rata. So we expect it to be pretty evenly spread throughout the year.\nKevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC\nGreat. That's helpful, Glenn. And then I know we're early in the year still, Dave. And there is typically a wide range of potential outcomes, but free cash flow guidance was maintained at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion despite seeing the strong organic growth. Just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of how the business trends are and is that just your typical conservatism or how should we think about the free cash flow guide?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nWhile I don't even know what I need to answer the question, you answered it for me. So it's early in the year. The guidance encompasses a wide range of outcomes. I'm not going to comment on my conservatism versus my aggressivism, if that's even a word. But look, it's a very substantial amount of free cash flow. Certainly, there are things that we did in operational performance that make us optimistic about our ability to do better, but it is the end of the first quarter. The guidance does encompass a wide range of outcomes for earnings and obviously that translates into cash. We had said that we're going to make some incremental capital investments this year as part of the benefit of tax reform in the business, so we feel very comfortable maintaining the free cash flow guidance as it was in the quarter.\nKevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC\nSounds good. Thanks, guys.\nGlenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nThe only thing I just add to that. Just, as you know, when you look at the seasonality of our business, our first quarter historically is in the 10% of our total year's cash flow. So we kind of came within that range doing $82 million, again out of a $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion total number. So obviously, as the year unfolds as we generate the bulk of our free cash flow throughout the year, we'll continue to give the updates on where we feel hopeful coming on.\nKevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC\nThat's helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.\nTyler L. Etten - Piper Jaffray & Co.\nGood morning. This is Tyler Etten on for Bill. I was wondering if you could talk about the opportunity with CMS approving next-gen sequencing. We're starting to see some small private payers follow suit. Are you guys viewing this as a coverage trend or maybe a little bit more conservative on that front?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nGood morning, Tyler, it's Dave. I think we've been in the forefront of next-gen sequencing again both on the clinical trial central lab side as well as on the clinical diagnostics side. We do see it as a significant opportunity particularly around our genetic testing. At the same time, private payer coverage remains less than robust at this point. And so we see the CMS coverage decision as probably the beginning of a trend, but we're going to follow the trend carefully and adjust accordingly.\nTyler L. Etten - Piper Jaffray & Co.\nGot it. Thanks. And then do you think that most of the negative weather effect is behind us now that we're at the end of the quarter or should we expect some weather effects in Q2?\nGlenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nI would say forecasting is an art. It's not a science. And I think we'd all agree that the worst forecasters tend to be the weather predictors. But from our perspective, we assume normal weather throughout the rest of the year, which is within the guidance. But as you recall, when we had the third quarter a year ago, we had adverse weather. So barring normal weather, we actually should see a pickup from weather in the third quarter, but obviously things that we don't control, which is why we don't forecast it to be anything other than kind of normalized.\nTyler L. Etten - Piper Jaffray & Co.\nGot it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is now open.\nRalph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nThanks. Good morning. Wanted to go to margins. They were down year-over-year, and I think you mentioned mix and acquisitions in the release. Maybe if you could flush that out for us. And more importantly, help frame the opportunity around sort of either margin expansion versus just holding the line or maybe even having margins contract in sort of the years ahead given PAMA?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nRalph, it's Dave. So we have been very clear that Diagnostics margins are going to be down this year as a result of PAMA. And the assumption would be that if PAMA is fully implemented as planned, we'll have margins headwinds in 2019 and 2020 as well. The other side of that is LaunchPad cost reductions, things that we're doing in the core diagnostics business to improve efficiency. Obviously, organic growth helps us to improve those margins as well as the test mix.\nOn the Covance side, obviously we saw 200-plus basis point improvement in year-over-year margins with the initial steps from LaunchPad. LaunchPad is a three-year program to improve service delivery and sustainably improve margins as well. So for the Diagnostics business, the likelihood is we're going to see pressure on margins. For the Covance business, margins expansion. And for the enterprise \u2013 for the enterprise as a whole, our goal, as we said in our third priority, is to continue to protect them and optimize them over time. I'm sorry. I misspoke. The Covance margins were up 120 basis points as opposed to the 200 that I overoptimistically stated. That will be for John to do next quarter.\nRalph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nFair enough. And then I was hoping you could maybe delve a little bit more into the Walgreens expansion. The incremental intent (52:42) is encouraging, but maybe help on what may or may not be potentially prohibiting much faster expansion. Is this something that you want Xcellerate more and Walgreens more reluctant to or the other way around, or is it not that dynamic, sort of not in play? And if there are any exclusivity, remind us around the relationship or could there be sort of \u2013 and if there was sort of interest from other retailers, is that something you could pursue? Thanks.\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nSure. So, on the question of exclusivity, there's exclusivity within the markets, but there's no blanket exclusivity. And so there could be other retail opportunities that we would pursue presumably. In fairness, there could be other lab opportunities that Walgreens might pursue. We have been very pleased with Walgreens as a partner. As I said earlier, we've talked a lot about other opportunities beyond what we're doing with the draw stations, and we expect this partnership to expand both in number of stores and in scope over the balance of 2018 and into the future.\nIn terms of the number of stores, we want to be selective and careful about the markets. We want to think more broadly now that we're demonstrating the success of the model about how we can use the Walgreens service center locations to change the model of how patients engage with us at our current service centers. So I don't think there's any hesitation on either side to scale the program. What we are doing is being very careful about the way that we roll it out to make sure that, one, we don't damage service levels or reduce qualities because we're trying to expand too fast. Two, we're both very interested in integrating the kiosk check-ins into the broader structure of their pharmacy in our lab, and so that requires some IT work that we're looking at. So there's just a number of reasons, but I would not take it as any hesitation on either side to scale up the project.\nRalph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nOkay, thanks for the comments.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nDan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nThank you. Just a couple of questions on the EPS guidance. First off, Glenn, can you help me better understand what changed as you assess the impact of ASC 606 because I thought that accounting change was already in your prior guidance. And then secondly, the offset that enabled you to maintain EPS guidance despite that headwind, how much of that would you characterize as organic versus other items like the legal settlement or tax coming in lower than we thought? Thank you.\nGlenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nSure. First, I guess on the EPS and ASC 606 and the guidance. As you saw when we gave our preliminary assessment and when we came out with our guidance, we did give preliminary restated revenue numbers for 2017 and then our growth rates for 2018, which was effectively adding the investigator fees and the other pass-through expenses. And so, as you saw in our change in guidance or the updating of our guidance, none of the growth rates on the revenue side were due to ASC 606. It was due to the strength of organic revenue growth within Diagnostics as well as the change in the currency.\nOn the earnings side, it's a little bit more challenging. There, while we did a sampling of the contracts that we have, and again, over 800 of them, the impact on the earnings was fairly negligible. We assume that over when we got to all 800 contracts going through the detailed review that they would be offsetting because effectively they were all pass-through. When we did the analysis and updated it, again, for every one of the contracts, what we saw was that, relative to the sample that we used initially, our contracts tended to be earlier stages of completing of the trials. And because the investigator fees and the other pass-through expenses tend to be more weighted towards the middle of the contracts, we were more weighted with earlier-stage contracts. And as a result, they caused our percentage of completion to change where effectively it moved it out a little bit.\nSo the earnings, and use 2017 as an example, there again we would assume that it would have a nominal impact. It had around a $55 million impact in earnings that will again be pushed out to future periods. And then similarly now in our guidance for 2018, as we roll those contracts forward, we have around, call it, $35 million of reduction in earnings relative to the old accounting standard, so less than the impact in 2017. But again, those earnings will be pushed out in the future as well.\nWith regard to the offsetting of the $0.20 to $0.30 impact from ASC 606, we talked about the strength of our organic revenues. We've talked about the impact that currency was favorable as well. When we gave our original guidance, at that point, we knew the adverse impact from weather other than there was some still bad weather later in the period, but the bulk of it was early. And we knew about the benefit of the legal settlement that was effectively going to be an offset to that. So relative to the guidance we provided, both of those were kind of muted out. The change really is driven off of the strong performance we had in the first quarter, and again, an improved outlook for the remainder of the year.\nDan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nOkay, that's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRicky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nHi, good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups here. When we think about just pricing, outside the United contract and outside PAMA, are there any other factors such as other contracts or renewals, or anything else that we should consider when we think about pricing beyond this year? And I understand that this is the beginning of 2018. But just conceptually, how should we think about the other factors that are either headwinds or tailwinds to price going forward?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nRicky, good morning. It's Dave. So I think you've essentially stated it correctly. The things we need to think about are PAMA. I'm not \u2013 I wouldn't \u2013 obviously, the United contract doesn't have any impact on our 2018 pricing unless and until there's a change in the contract status. The impact of acquisitions and the annualization of acquisitions, so PAML and the price point of PAML probably being higher than our typical in-counter price. And remember, a lot of that is reference work that comes from hospitals. So that annualization will certainly have an impact.\nGenerally, what I would say is our private pricing has been relatively stable over the last several years, as we've said. We don't see anything that is going to have an immediate impact on that. And so the major impact, as we've said, is mix, which is not unit price and unit pricing relating to PAMA.\nRicky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nOkay. And then on the cost-cutting side, I appreciate the comments on margin. But how should we think about the cadence of the cost-cutting throughout the year?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nAgain, it's Dave. We are not guiding to quarter-by-quarter impact of LaunchPad. I would say, remember that there were some reductions that we did last year that we're getting the full-year impact of this year that will annualize. And then the impact of things like global service delivery, which started in the first quarter, will actually accelerate throughout the year.\nSo I guess the best way to put it is think about the Covance LaunchPad and the Chiltern synergies as essentially being spread ratably over the three-year period. And then within that period \u2013 within each year, you'll typically see a relatively even distribution subject to some ups and downs.\nRicky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.\nMark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.\nHey, thank you. Obviously, 23andMe has seen massive growth from at-home testing with saliva for genetic testing. Dave, can you speak to the impact you think you might have from your at-home blood collection device and maybe speak to some of the test menu that will be available?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nSure. The at-home device is designed to open another channel to consumers and patients. The initial test menu will be probably in the range of about 20 analytes, and will focus on things that are of high interest to consumers like hemoglobin A1c and also to payers.\nAnd there are several ways that we think about why this is important. One, just in conversations with leaders of large payers, one of the things that I'm hearing over and over again is the costliest patients are the patients who are sick at home. They're not engaging with the system. That's why they're showing up in acute crises in the emergency room, and we need to find a better way to reach them.\nSo you're seeing a lot more activity around home health. You're seeing a lot more activity around home monitoring. And for us, this is a simple way of supporting not only the consumer who wants to know about the status of their health through labs, but also the payer community, including the government payers, in being able to reach patients in the home in a convenient and low-cost manner.\nSo I'm not going to make an estimate in terms of what is the market opportunity or where is it going to go, but I think it's a really important initiative for us again to open another channel to reach consumers and then to think about is this kit available for sale in the retail setting, is it delivered through a distributor or a wholesaler who has a home business. These are potential further legs of the business as we roll it out.\nMark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.\nGreat, thanks. And my second question, at the risk of oversimplifying or handicapping the outcome of the ACLA versus HHS case, is it fair to speculate that relief to the 2021 to 2023 is the bull case here in terms of the cuts that could be rendered in those next three years or do you see another alternative that could be even more appealing than that?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nI've said all along that, first of all, any time you sue the government, it is an uphill battle. Nevertheless, on the merits \u2013 and they're dense legal papers but I have read them. On the merits, we have a very convincing and powerful case. Congress wrote a statute in which it specifically instructed the Secretary to do something, and that something was do a market survey that included hospitals. The Secretary wrote a rule that excluded over 90% of the hospitals in the United States. So the Secretary didn't do what Congress said. And legally, I believe that means that rule should be set aside, and that is what we're seeking in relief. We're not seeking change in the payment cuts. We're seeking that the rule be set aside and the Secretary be told to go back and do what Congress said to do.\nSo to me, the right case is the judge rules in our favor, the rule is set aside, the Secretary restarts the process of rulemaking, and we end up with a rule that carries out congressional intent. And that would have the impact of resetting the 2018, 2019, 2020 reductions and coming to a market assessment of the lab industry, which is exactly what Congress asked for the Secretary to do. Congress said to the Secretary get Medicare to market. It didn't say get Medicare to the absolute lowest price on every single test, which seems to be what the Secretary is trying to achieve.\nMark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC\nHey, good morning. Glenn, just a quick question on tax. So you're maintaining the tax rate at 25%, but with the exclusion of the tax benefit from stock comp, am I right in thinking that your effective baseline tax rate assumption actually went down?\nGlenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nNo. We guided \u2013 we assume that we would be roughly 25% on an adjusted basis, and we continue to believe that. The first quarter is always going to \u2013 I shouldn't say always. Obviously, hopefully, we're always seeing our share price appreciation, so we're getting a benefit from the stock-based comp impact on taxes. But we know that when we provide our guidance. So our stock comp, if you will, vests in February in the first quarter, you'll have seen that in the trends that same quarter a year ago that we'll have a lower effective tax rate. And then throughout the year, we do not forecast any more change relative to stock comp. So to the extent that people are exercising shares that we obviously can't forecast, there could be a benefit from that going forward, but we don't model that. So we still feel the 25% is the right number for the year with the first quarter coming in, call it, around 23% and obviously implies that we'll be a little bit above 25% for the remaining three quarters.\nBrian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC\nGot you. And then for John, are you seeing any changes in how your customers are making decisions based on data enablement? And then are there any wins you can call on Xcellerate at this point?\nJohn D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nI do think that most of our customers are using data with respect to decisions on patient recruitment strategies, on site selection, on protocol optimization. Now certain therapeutic areas are more applicable to the use of that data, but almost consistently across the board, whether it's our central lab data, whether it's our diagnostics data, they are utilizing that to their benefit in terms of the strategies of the aforementioned three years.\nSo, specific wins, I think as Dave said, we obviously have over a (1:08:46) quarters and on track to the revenue goals that we had before, but as you know, Brian, those decisions when they're made on \"data\" are also made on the project team, the medics, the capabilities of strategy. It's never just one thing. And so we do look at this as a hugely differentiating factor and the reason why we're winning to the extent we have with the strong book-to-bills of around 1.3 times.\nBrian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC\nGot it, thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rohan Abrol from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.\nRohan Abrol - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.\nHey, good morning. Just wanted to find out if you're seeing any changes with respect to your full-service versus FSP demand in Covance?\nJohn D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nThe program versus FSP, I'm not seeing a swing to one way or another. The greatest thing in terms of the \u2013 or one of the areas that the Chiltern acquisition benefited us greatly on was the capability within the FSP areas, especially around the biometric space and now adding the strength of a legacy Covance in the monitoring space having that now enterprise offering, but we're seeing real strength on the programmatic side as well and across therapeutic areas, the oncology area. And I'd have to say the investments in the talent, team, therapeutic areas, et cetera, that LabCorp Covance have made in the past are assisting with the programmatic wins as well. I'm not seeing a shift one way or another, to answer your question.\nRohan Abrol - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.\nOkay. I appreciate that. And then did you guys comment on the amount of project awards associated with access to patient lab data this quarter?\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nIt's Dave. I think as John just said, we exceeded $0.5 billion. We're not updating that number, but you can assume that it continues to grow.\nRohan Abrol - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave King for closing remarks.\nDavid P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings\nThank you very much for joining us this morning. I think what you can gather from this call is that we are intently focused on two things. One is execution. The other is innovation. And our focus on execution and innovation is delivering impressive results, and we're excited that we will be updating you on those results in the quarters to come. We wish you a good day.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.\n\n",

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without express written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.\nNow I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.\nShawn Bevec - Executive Director-Investor Relations\nThank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks and a PowerPoint presentation will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website.\nNow here's Steve Rusckowski.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on industry dynamics and review progress on our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.\nThrough the second quarter, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis related to our efforts to refocus the business, but grew 2.4% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS grew more than 69%, while adjusted EPS grew more than 7%.\nBefore I get into our strategy update, I'd like to provide perspective on a few key aspects of the final rule implementing provisions of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, referred to as PAMA, issued late last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, referred to as CMS.\nFirst, on the issue of timing, we are pleased with CMS's decision to delay the implementation of the new payment system until January 1, 2018, a position advocated by members of Congress, hospitals and hospital \u2013 excuse me, and laboratory trade associations.\nSecond, CMS changed its approach to secure a better view of market pricing. By gathering the pricing data from labs in a different way, CMS will increase the number of labs that provide pricing data. And finally, we continue to evaluate the impact of this final rule, but we won't have a clear view until we see the final pricing data.\nIn the meantime, CMS is estimating a mid-single digit rate reduction in 2018. As you know, the clinical lab fee schedule represents approximately 12% of our revenues. As we've shared in the past, our Invigorate savings have more than compensated for price headwinds in the market. So if there is a fee reduction in 2018, we would be able to manage it.\nNow let me shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy, which, as you recall, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our Diagnostic Information Service business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. So starting with growth, we delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas including prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C testing, and Cardio IQ, which provides a more complete picture of patients' cardiovascular health with basic cholesterol testing.\nWe also grew in the second quarter with the help from our new hospital service agreements. Our acquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Service business of Clinical Laboratory Partners, referred to as CLP, and professional lab services agreements from Barnabas Health are helping us deliver the continued execution of our accelerated growth plan.\nAdditionally in this quarter, we announced an agreement to manage the inpatient laboratory operations for six Denver-area hospitals in HealthONE System of HCA Healthcare. We expect to see revenues from this engagement before the end of the year.\nYou know, hospitals continue to talk to us about how we can help them execute their lab strategy, from advanced hospital reference testing to lab management to joint ventures and outreach lab purchases. Our pipeline remains strong and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities.\nIn advanced testing, we strengthened our service offering, which includes gene-based and esoteric tests. During the quarter, we announced that there will be three new Quest Vantage Answer tests. These are designed to provide clinical actionable insight into an individual's risk of developing hereditary forms of cancer. These new offerings will better position us in this exciting and growing marketplace.\nWe piloted a program this quarter for non-invasive prenatal screening to serve women of average risk in select regions. Encouraged by the results, we're now offering the testing nationally.\nWe continued to drive operational excellence, the second element of our strategy. We believe quality and efficiency go hand in hand and we have strong evidence of demonstrated improvement in our customer experience as we make our business more efficient. As we deliver cost savings, we're also able to improve quality and service. This is a well-understood principle of total quality management approaches across all industries. Evidence of this can be seen in a recent independent blinded survey of more than 500 physicians. In the survey, Quest scored highest on customer experience, lab effectiveness and patient satisfaction among national, regional and hospital competitors.\nOur recent agreement with Safeway will make it easier for people to get tested by locating our Patient Service Centers in high-traffic Safeway supermarkets. By expanding patient access through our relationships with retailers, we will optimize our real estate footprint and have an opportunity to reduce the number of unfulfilled test orders, which some suggest could be as high as 30%.\nWe're also shrinking our real estate footprint by consolidating our corporate sites. In June, we announce the relocation of our corporate headquarters and support functions from Madison and Lyndhurst, New Jersey to a single location when our current 10-year lease expires in September of 2017. By consolidating our footprint, we'll be able to get greater collaboration and performance while realizing savings in operating expenses. Our Invigorate cost savings program continues on track to realize $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017.\nWe continue to simplify and strengthen our organizational capabilities, the third element of our strategy.\nAlso this quarter, we were proud to be recognized as one of 100 companies named to Forbes 2016 America's Most Trustworthy Companies list, the only company from the diagnostic services industry to be included.\nThe fourth element of our strategy, to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business, was completed in May, following the completion of the sale of the Focus Diagnostic Products business. Proceeds from the sale of Focus Products were used to drive the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We launched the $250 million accelerated share repurchase program, ASR, with the Focus proceeds. And since 2012, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion of company stock. Additionally, in May, we issued $500 million in debt to take advantage of favorable interest rates and refinance a portion of our debt. We actually look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day in New York City on November 11. So mark your calendars, and we'll be providing more data about this as time goes on.\nNow Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nThanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.91 billion were lower by 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.4% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.2% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the prior year. Of the 1.9%, approximately half came from organic growth and the other half from recent acquisitions, including both CLP and MemorialCare.\nThrough the first half of 2016, organic volume is up nearly 2%, a solid increase compared to the slight decline reported in the first half of 2015. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter increased 0.2% versus a year ago. As a reminder, a number of different elements impact revenue per req, including unit price variation, business mix, and tests per req. Price headwinds were in line with our expectations, down slightly less than 1%. As we noted last quarter, our Professional Lab Services, or PLS engagement, such as Barnabas Health and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing. In Q2 2016, the year-over-year impact of growth in PLS was approximately 120 basis points on our aggregate revenue per req. In the second quarter, PLS was a larger mix of our business and as we move through the year, we expect PLS to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business.\nReported operating income for the quarter was $422 million, or 22.1% of revenues, compared to $301 million, or 15.6% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $324 million, or 17% of revenues, compared to $321 million, or 16.7% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues and our Invigorate initiative, slightly offset by lower margins related to recent acquisitions, our growing Professional Lab Services business and our efforts to refocus the company. The impact of our clinical trials and products businesses in the second quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating margins by approximately $15 million.\nAs a reminder, the clinical trials business now appears on the equity earnings line. Also, we no longer have operating earnings associated with the Focus Products business and recall that we used the proceeds to repurchase shares. In total, our portfolio divestitures represented $169 million of revenues that were excluded to get to our equivalent revenues for 2015.\nReported EPS was $1.37 in the quarter, compared to $0.81 a year ago. The significant year-over-year increase was driven, in large part, by the gain on the sale of our Focus Diagnostics Products business in the second quarter and charges on retirement of debt in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.34, up from $1.25 last year. The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $17 million in the quarter, representing a $34 million gain on the sale of the Focus Products business, offset by approximately $17 million of primarily restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items increased our reported EPS by $0.12.\nBad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2%, 40 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our clinical trials and products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate year over year improved slightly.\nOur DSOs were 47 days, three days higher than last year and the prior quarter. This was driven by the timing of certain cash receipts and we expect our DSOs to come down to levels similar to the prior year by the end of Q3.\nThrough the first half of 2016, reported cash provided by operations was $464 million versus $337 million last year. Excluding charges associated with early debt retirement in the first half of 2016 and debt refinancing in the first half of 2015, adjusted operating cash flow was $502 million through June 30, 2016, up from $464 million in 2015. Capital expenditures were $104 million in the first half compared to $117 million a year ago.\nBefore moving to guidance, I'd like to mention a few items for you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, the year-over-year impact of the contribution of our clinical trials business to the Q2 [Q Squared] JV on reported revenues ended in the second quarter of 2016. Recall this transaction commenced at the beginning of our third quarter 2015. Second, for the Celera Products business that we wound down toward the end of last year, we recognized nearly half of the 2015 revenues and operating earnings for this business in the third quarter of 2015 as customers executed their last time buys. This will set up a difficult compare in the third quarter this year. As you think about the split for the remainder of the year, last year we had approximately $10 million on a reported basis and $12 million on adjusted basis of Celera Products operating income in Q3 and nothing in Q4.\nFinally, there are two notable items on our full-year reported operating cash flow projections. The first relates to after-tax cash charges of $29 million from the retirement of debt that will impact 2016 operating cash flow. Second, we will incur a cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow despite recognizing the associated $275 million from the sale in our investing cash flow. Therefore, our adjusted operating cash flow for 2016 will exclude both items.\nHaving noted these items, our 2016 outlook is as follows: revenues to be between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion, flat to an increase of approximately 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis, and an increase of 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis; reported diluted EPS to be between $4.18 and $4.33; adjusted EPS to be between $5.02 and $5.17. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $880 million on a reported basis and roughly $1 billion on an adjusted basis. Finally, capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million.\nNow, let me turn it back to Steve.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we built on our good start in 2016 with another solid performance of second quarter. Revenues grew by more than 2% on an equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS grew more than 7%. We continued to generate strong cash from operations and we've remained on track to meet our commitments for the remainder of the year. Now we'd be happy to take any questions. Operator?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. We will now open it up to questions. our first question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nHi, Brian.\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nMorning, Brian.\nBrian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC\nOn the hospital JVs. I know that's something that you alluded to a little bit earlier in your prepared remarks. What are you seeing in the landscape on the hospitals now, and how do you envision this joint venture with HCA in terms of the opportunity set or the receptivity of HCA and other for-profit hospitals to expand into a similar kind of strategy?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nwell, a couple points, Brian. Thanks for the question. First of all, as I mentioned in my remarks, the interest of hospital CEOs, CFOs and their teams to work with us on their lab strategy is growing, evidenced with what we did with Hartford Hospital and their CLP laboratory. In fact, I was just up there last week meeting with the CEO and meeting with my team. And once we engage and we have this definite relationship, I would say the relationship continues to grow and we are their strategic partner for diagnostic information services. The same continues to grow at Barnabas. We feel good about the progress made there. Again, it continues to expand.\nAnd then you asked a question about HCA. HCA is not a joint venture. It is a contract. It's an agreement that we're helping them run their inpatient laboratories and we're hopeful that that will go well and could potentially provide us with more opportunities going forward, but one step at a time. Our job right now is to do a good job at the Denver area in this division and we can take it from there. So this continues to be a growth prospect for us. We've been focused on it for a number of years as you know, and we're starting to see the results.\nBrian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC\nAnd then, Steve, you alluded to the Safeway arrangement. So, how should we think about the rationalization of the platform or the PSCs? Is that something that is based in a way to invigorate guidance, or is that going to be an incremental opportunity to reduce cost as you shift all your PSC's into the Safeways?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah. Well, first of all, there's three aspects of the work we've done with retailers and Safeway is a good example. First of all, it's to improve the patient experience. If you've seen any of these Safeway clinics or healthcare centers, they're very nice and so it provides a really nice, fresh patient experience for our patients, so we're pleased with that. So again, goes hand in hand with our strategy around improving quality patient experience, at the same time becoming more efficient. And on the efficiency side, we are looking at where these stores are, where we have Patient Service Centers, and where possible, we'll optimize that and take some cost out.\nBut in some cases, we're also augmenting our unparalleled access to the marketplace with some of their locations. So it actually allows us to get greater access. And we think of this market, to the last point I made in my introductory remarks, it's quite important for us to continue to get more and more access for patients where they are. And retail has a great opportunity for us to continue to get more and more access because the data we have is about 30% of laboratory requisitions in the marketplace go unfulfilled. And so our notion is if they have more access, make it more convenient, make it easy for people to go in, get their laboratory requisition fulfilled, it's going to be better for healthcare and it's going to be better for this industry. So that's our strategy.\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah, I just want to add in, Brian, that as Steve pointed out, this is not just a cost play and certainly we believe that it's an opportunity to grow our business faster by making our sites more accessible, making things more convenient, making it a more positive experience. But in terms of your other question around Invigorate, you can imagine that our retail strategy's going to work through over time. So at this point we've only given guidance on Invigorate through the end of 2017. Obviously at some point we'll give an update beyond then. So we've got multi-year leases in many cases for our Patient Service Centers. We are not going to dilute our volume and add a lot of incremental sites, so really this is largely going to be replacing Patient Service Centers. So it's not going to be ever 100% of our footprint for a couple reasons.\nOne is for that, because we want to make sure we're located where we need to be and there may not always be a retail opportunity. The second thing is we've got some Patient Service Centers where we might have four, five phlebotomists at a time. And given the limited space in a retail site, we're never going to be able to move those kind of centers fully into retail.\nSo we see it as a great opportunity, but it's not going to be a full replacement. And in terms of its impact on our cost savings and our Invigorate, which also is revenue enhancement, it's going to play out over the next couple years.\nBrian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nHi, Ricky.\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nHi, Ricky.\nRicky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nYeah, hi. Good morning, guys. I have two questions. First one just in terms of clarification around the moving parts around pricing. I think you mentioned that the hospital contracts are a price headwind of 120 basis points. So can you just kind of like walk us through what the headwinds and tailwinds are on the price metric?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nMark, I think that's yours.\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah, sure. So, again, I want to separate price from mix. I think it's really important. So price itself, as we mentioned, which is apples-to-apples price for the same offering on a given test was down a little less than 1% in the quarter. So everything else was mix. So what we did share is the mix impact for Professional Laboratory Services was a headwind of 120 basis points. So you could back into everything else was the positive mix that offset price and offset the mix of PLS to give us a net 20 basis point improvement in revenue per req.\nNow with that said, the reason we're very careful, Ricky, about separating price from mix is that while price definitely directionally is an indication of profitability, mix is not always representative of profitability, so we caution people, and as we've said over time, don't take math, which is mix driven, as a signal for increased or decreased profitability.\nRicky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nOkay. And just to clarify on that impact from hospital, is that something that you expect to improve over the course of the year, over the course of the contract? Or is this just going to be a matter of we have to think about it from a comp perspective?\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nSo it's a very different business, Ricky, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, and because of the nature of that business, it happens to have fewer tests and different priced tests than our core business. And those tests are at an attractive margin, so it's not indicative that, again, just because it has lower revenue per req, that that means it's not a profitable test. And in fact, the impact should grow because our expectations are that PLS will grow faster than our core book of business, and therefore that mix impact will increase over time, not just this year, but as our strategy would be going forward, we see more and more of these opportunities.\nRicky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nOkay. And then my next question is more longer-term nature, really focusing on 2018, which is the first year of PAMA. When we think about the different moving parts and try to better understand the earnings power, obviously there's more clarity on PAMA now, but can you just kind of like help us through to think what are the other variables we need to think about? Do you have any big contract up for renewal in 2018? And also as you think about expanding Invigorate beyond 2017, how much more cost do you estimate you'll need to take out in order to offset the PAMA impact?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, so first of all on PAMA, as we said in our remarks, we're pleased we have a push-out of the date. Second is we're pleased that they've expanded with the approach of more laboratories in the sample set, and we'll see when we get to 2018 if there is a price reduction and how much it is. And they estimate that as mid-single digits.\nAnd then also what we said is if you go back and look at our history, the reason why we have Invigorate and the reason why we continue to drive quality and efficiency is to be able to absorb some of the headwinds. And obviously, true price concessions, and I treat this as true price concessions, as Mark just said, is one of the offsets. So what we said and what we believe is when we get there, we'll have to absorb this, and we will absorb this.\nSo with that said, we've only provided guidance and an outlook for Invigorate through 2017. What I said in my remarks is they continue to be on track for that. It's $1.3 billion, it's an additional $600 million from what we achieved a couple years ago, so we feel good about the progress made on that.\nAnd then what we also have said is that in any business, in any industry, you need to continue to drive efficiency and quality going forward past 2017, and we're not prepared at this point to talk about that. But given what I said earlier, obviously, we're going to have to have some efficiency gains in 2018 to be able to offset any kind of price erosion and we feel confident that we'll have those given what we have in our perspective on the future.\nSo that's what I can share this point, but we're encouraged by what we've learned in the visibility around PAMA. We're encouraged by Invigorate and the progress we're making there. And we're not done with that. We'll continue to make progress, and we'll deal with that in due course.\nRicky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nThank you.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open.\nRoss Muken - Evercore Group LLC\nHi. Good morning, gentleman.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nGood morning, Ross.\nRoss Muken - Evercore Group LLC\nI guess you talked a lot about some of the improvements across the business. Obviously quite evident first part of this year versus last year and the few prior. Now, I guess, where do you feel like the momentum has been maybe better than you would have expected? Maybe it's on some of the PLS agreements or what bps is looking like?\nAnd then is there any part that you would point to as it's trended that maybe you feel like needs to be more of a tailwind for you than it's been? It feels like the business is sort of starting to turn a corner here. So I'm just trying to differentiate where you feel like maybe not you've declared victory, but you're sort of where you want to be versus not.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, I appreciate the question. And what we've said for the last four years is that our restore growth strategy is multifaceted. This business, this industry has a number of products, a number of different programs, a number of different services. And we have to work multiple fronts.\nTo answer your direct question about where we are encouraged, we are encouraged about the continued prospects around advanced diagnostics; the genetic offerings that we introduced this quarter are very strong. We feel they're very competitive now with some of the incumbents in the marketplace, particularly around our BRCA offering. We expanded our panel. We have now a very nice comprehensive hereditary-based panel.\nAnd as you know, we continue to build on our relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering in that space. And we offer some nice offerings around colorectal cancer, as well as a comprehensive hereditary cancer panel. So that is good and growing, and a lot of promise in front of it.\nSecond is we talked about the work around hepatitis C continues to be a great opportunity for us. Last quarter, we talked about the companion diagnostics associated with it. That is promising.\nAnd then third is prescription drug monitoring continues to be a big opportunity for us. It's growing. We're pleased with our progress. And as you know in this country, there's a lot of renewed interest around pain meds and opiates and misuse of those and we're right in the middle of that whole debate. And we're part of the solution to that problem. And with that, we're coupling that with our Hospital Services business, which we've been working on for the past four years. You're starting to see the fruits of our efforts there. We're very pleased with our announcement of Barnabas. We're very pleased with the acquisition of our Hartford Hospital outreach relationship, which again is a purchase, but at the same time it builds a relationship with Hartford Hospital. We're very pleased with our first work with HCA. And as I said, there's many more prospects in our funnel that we continue to be happy about.\nNow with that said, the last question is where you think there's more promise. I think this last piece, the strategy around hospitals, is something that I believe will continue to be a great growth driver for us. As I work the country and speak with our teams and speak with hospital CEOs and their management teams, they clearly can't do it all themselves, and they're looking for partnerships. And they realize that all we do every day is diagnostic information services. And where we have these relationships are those organizations that realize they're best served serving their population and doing best in their business by relying on us for their diagnostic information services business. So I think there's a lot more growth opportunities going forward than what we've seen so far, and I'm optimistic about that. Thank you for the question.\nRoss Muken - Evercore Group LLC\nYeah, that was great. And maybe just quick follow-up on the cancer genetic side. There's so much going on and we continue to hear more optimistic things in terms of the companion PD-L1. How is your thought process evolving around how you're going to play there? Obviously you have some existing relationships. And how you size that market versus maybe some of the legacy similar type drugs?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, well, first of all, it's evolving, it's growing, it's exciting. As you know, reimbursement's always the challenge in this space. While we have focused on those areas where there is good reimbursement, and clearly, BRCA is one of the best examples of the industry seeing benefit from it and now it's getting reimbursed for it. And as we introduced with our new product this past quarter but we now have an expanded channel in that regard for other hereditary markers in that offering.\nWe believe that it looks promising for us and it provides more prospects for growth and we continue to work the reimbursement side of this to demonstrate with good clinical evidence that in fact that that actually delivering value that's actionable because only when you can defend that you have good clinical value and it is actionable, then you will get paid by healthcare insurance companies. So we're continuously working that. So it's evolving but it is exciting and it's a key opportunity for growth for us going forward.\nRoss Muken - Evercore Group LLC\nGreat. Thank you.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nHi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nGood morning.\nJack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nI wanted to start just on the underlying utilization trends you're seeing. I know, Mark, you mentioned about half the growth was from CLP and MemorialCare. What do you think \u2013 did Barnabas and maybe the movement of Easter add in the quarter? And then just in general what are you seeing in terms of the physician office trend?\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah. So I have not, and I wouldn't break out a specific engagement like Barnabas and its impact, but certainly it contributed positively for us. As you look at all the moving parts, Jack, I think the organic growth is a pretty solid number, taking into account the movement of Easter and other calendar shifts and so on and so forth. So you can look at the approximately 100 basis points of organic growth and count on that as being solid and something that's a trend that we're going to build on and continue throughout the balance of the year driven by growth in our core business and also some growth in this new opportunity being our professional laboratory services, most notably Barnabas. But I'm not going to be splitting out specific relationships or engagements each quarter.\nJack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nYeah, understood. And then one more on PAMA. I'm just curious now that the final rule is out in the market and is beginning to get digested by the industry, are you seeing any different tone with either hospitals or smaller independent labs in terms of the M&A around whether it's in-sourcing versus outsourcing and just the relationships that you develop there? Thanks.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nWell, I can't say that the build, if you will, of interest around building a relationship with Quest is specifically related to what's going on with PAMA. But there might be some correlation between PAMA in that it's another contributing factor. When we have conversations with hospital systems, they talk about the changing nature of their business, they're moving away from fee for service to taking risk. When you move the risk, they need to have a low-cost provider. There's no question we're a lower cost provider than typically their hospital lab is, and they have a lot of other priorities and why would they put the next dollar of investment into laboratory when they have a good national leader nearby?\nAnd so that's typically the conversation we have, and they realize that there's going to be price pressure on the commercial rate in every place. And, yes, their laboratory commercial rates will be under pressure, but also they understand Medicare is not going to also provide a lot of help as well. So there could be pressure there. So it's contributing but it's not necessarily, I would say, an overall driver so far. But with all that said, I think people have realized that there will be, with all this analysis for interest in it going forward, it's hard to say beyond what the estimate was of mid-single digits in 2018, how that will affect specific labs.\nSo that estimate is based upon the market basket that CMS says. The fees for all their expenditures from the clinical lab fee schedule, and so when you specifically apply whatever cuts there might be to a specific business, they could be considerable for small operators that are doing mostly routine testing in a small geography. And they're not billing out all the codes like we do for clinical lab fee schedule for Medicare. So it's unfolding, so more to learn, but I think we've got a lot more clarity today than we did six months ago.\nJack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nUnderstood, thanks, guys.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nSteven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nOkay. Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Mark. Congrats on these results.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nMorning.\nSteven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nJust on the PAMA related reimbursement change delay, it's obviously good news as you mentioned. But it does still seem from some calls that we're getting that maybe there's still a little bit of investor confusion as to whether or not there could be any CMS cuts to the CLFS in 2017 to essentially replace the PAMA delay. I think there was some color in the final rule that suggests this is probably even more unlikely now, but maybe it wouldn't hurt on this call just to give your latest thoughts on that just to clear the air if you are able to. Thanks.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nSo I think CMS is very focused on getting PAMA right. It is an act of Congress and therefore, any change to PAMA would require another act of Congress. So their entire focus is on this. Clearly, they've got to get it right. They've been told by Congress that they need to do it with a market based approach, and this is their entire focus. So from our view, this is what we should expect will happen in 2017, is really gathering all the data, going through all the data trying to understand it. And as you know, we still have the CPI adjustment and the productivity adjustments as well. And some of that came through in 2016 and will continue to come through as time goes on. So our view is this is going to be predominance of focus for CMS and how we get paid.\nSteven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nOkay. Got it. One other quick one, just if I can sneak one in too. The earlier color on the Safeway retail deal is helpful. Just the one quick follow-up on that is, I'm curious whether that Safeway deal precludes you from entering into other similar large deals with other retailers in those six states that you've entered into so far. And could you theoretically still do a national retail deal like this with any third party if you chose to do so? Thanks.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, we continue to have freedom to operate. It's a great relationship. We could build on it. But we believe there's more opportunities for us to build our patient access. We have unparalleled access, we believe. We have over 2200 Patient Service Centers, they have over 3500 people in physicians' offices, and then we have partnerships with JVs.\nSo \u2013 and it continues to build, and we think this retail opportunity, as I described, has really got those three prongs. One is great patient experience, second is that helps us with efficiency, and potentially, augments that unparalleled access, with nice access to where people go every day which are typically retail stores. So we're encouraged, but we have more prospects as well going forward to expand in even further because we're not limited in our ability to operate with the relationship we have with Safeway.\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYes. As Steve said, the contract with Safeway does not preclude us from other arrangements. But as you might imagine, we're not going to put in redundant space. So if we have a Safeway location in a given neighborhood, it's unlikely, even if we have a partnership with another retailer, that we would put another PSC in the same location. So it's really all about mapping this out, the demographics where our business is, where we draw the businesses from the physician's office, et cetera.\nSo in the partnership in Safeway it's really important, and they're kind of, since they're on the lead here, they're going to be one of the first people to decide, in partnership with us, where we're going to put some of these locations. And so I wanted to stress that while it doesn't preclude us and we certainly are in discussion with other retailers, we highly value the Safeway agreement, and as I said, as the first mover, they're going to going to be the one we're starting with.\nSteven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nOkay, got it. Okay. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Line is open.\nAmanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC\nHi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on PAMA. So I'm not sure if you have an answer to this, but I'm just curious, in terms of using the NPI from a hospital perspective, just given that you have quite a few relationships with hospitals at this point, I'm just wondering how, or if you have any view into how they're looking at that piece of it, particularly if they don't have an NPI as a hospital lab. Is that something you think that hospital labs will have incentives to get at this point? Or is yours the opposite view?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, well first of all, as I said in my remarks, the movement away from using the TIN, the tax ID number, to a net provider indicator or (44:04) number, is positive. We think there'll be more labs required to contribute their data to CMS with that.\nBut like so many parts of healthcare, we don't fully appreciate the extent of how many more and what percentage that will be. And actually, as trade associations, as American Clinical Lab Association, we're going to sponsor a project to actually do a sampling of hospitals to see if in fact there are \u2013 what this does to the sample. Because our objective, along with Congress, along with CMS is to get this right, and we said it should be market based, and we all agree that the market includes the national labs, the regional labs and hospital outreach. And so we appreciate this new approach, but we want to make sure that this new approach does capture possible outreach. So we're going to run a study to see what it shows us and then take it from there.\nAmanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC\nOkay. Fair enough. And then just on the Quintiles JV, just wanted to get an update there given their relationship with IMS. I think you had talked in the past about potentially working with Quintiles more broadly than the central lab. So wondering how those conversations are going at this point.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nWell, we continue to focus on our integration of our laboratory operations, and that was the primary focus of the joint venture is to bring both of our businesses together and take out the cost, the redundant cost of both those operations. We're making very good progress on that front. We feel good about it, and as Mark said in his introductory remarks, it's showing up in our results below the operating income line. But we will build value through that relationship.\nAs far as other work with Quintiles, what we shared before is, yes, we will consider working with Quintiles and IMS and others around how we use our data to help with drug discovery. We have nothing really firm in place with any of them, but I'll share with you that we have multiple working relationships, and one of those relationships is with Quintiles. So we continue to look at what the data means and how we could use it and doing some tests with a variety of potential partners in this space. So we're still encouraged about the prospects, but having some type of preferred or exclusive or closer relationship is not what we have today.\nAmanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC\nGot it. Thanks very much.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.\nWilliam R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.\nGreat. Thank you, and good morning, everyone.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nGood morning, Bill.\nWilliam R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.\nSo first question I guess is going back to the earlier HCA HealthONE lab management question, and that is in the event that you were able to expand this, do you have any sense, Steve, what time, I guess, the evaluation period would be? I'm just trying to get an idea here. Is this a two-year see if this works and we can expand it, or is this a longer-term sort of project?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThat would be highly speculative for me to comment on that. We have to be successful at this first project, demonstrate we can save them money. I mean, in the end, this all about making their inpatient laboratory more efficient. We believe we can. When we put those points on the board, we realized that that's going to be very visible to HCA management and we'll take it from there. But beyond what I said, it would be highly speculative for me to comment on how fast it's going to move.\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nJust be clear, the relationship itself is not a pilot. It is a firm multi-year relationship that we're committed to. What we were implying is that, as you might imagine, there's a possibility of further expansion. And whether it's within HCA or other hospital systems, seeing the momentum we're getting, hearing from some of the CEOs with whom we have relationships how successful these things are going and how valuable it is to them. So we will save them money. So it's really, in our minds, just a matter of comfort and time before we'll expand these somewhere. Whether we expand it more broadly within HCA or other places, we think the better your track record is, the better opportunity you have to get more people onboard. And it is with the Denver division of HCA, just to be clear, not with HCA itself.\nWilliam R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.\nI appreciate the color. Thank you. And then secondly, just I guess latest thoughts around the FDA's LDT initiative. It seems like every day that goes by without it getting to OMB or congressional notification suggests that we may see a legislative solution?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nWell, we're working it. As you know, we believe as an industry that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to regulate laboratories and LDTs. We've been working proactively on a legislative solution with a number of groups. We've made some progress on that front, but as you know, it's the summer months and not a lot will happen in the summer months in Washington. So we will see, when the fall is here, where this goes, but we think a legislative solution is the best option for us. And that's the one that we're pursuing, and we hope we can be able to get to a place that we can accept as the Trade Association and as the company going forward. But it's still there, but it's moving at a very slow pace.\nWilliam R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.\nUnderstood. Thanks for the color.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from A. J. Rice, UBS. Your line is open.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nHey. Good morning, A. J.\nA. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC\nOh, thanks. Hi, everybody. How are you?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nGood.\nA. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC\nWith the pickup in the pace around deals with hospitals, whether its contract, outright purchasing of business and other structures, can you just maybe comment a little bit on how those structures have evolved and the economics of the deals that you're seeing today versus a few years ago? Are they different, about same? Are you pushing a different type of structure? Is the hospital asking for any kind of different structure? Just give us some flavor on that.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, well, first of all, you see one deal, you see one deal. We've said this before because healthcare is complex. Every deal has got its own nuances as you could appreciate. And you have to separate. When we buy an outreach business, that's an outright purchase of their existing commercial business. And in the case, a good example of that is what we did with Hartford Hospital and CLP, which we closed and we're in the process of integrating.\nAnd I would characterize those deals as being similar to the other ones we've done. We take over the business. We reprice it at our rates. We build a business case around taking out cost and we think the returns for our shareholders are quite good. But what I'll also say, and I said this in my introductory remarks, when we typically do that, it typically gets us into a broader conversation about their lab strategy. And so typically they say, wow (51:18), okay, now we're tight with you. Let's talk about our advanced testing for our hospitals, or what's called reference testing, and let's talk about how you potentially could help us with our hospital inpatient laboratory and making that more efficient. So it typically becomes a beachhead opportunity for us to build a stronger relationship.\nThe second type of relationship, A. J., is we have an engagement, a professional services engagement like the one we have with Barnabas. And that's a services relationship. It's multi-year. We're providing service for a fee. We believe that we agree on certain conditions of delivery and payment, and we run it as that. And again, when we get in those relationships, because this is all around their inpatient laboratory, we then typically get in a conversation around their outreach business. Is that something they want to continue to stay in? Could we help them with it? And second is their advanced testing or their reference testing business. So we have that conversation, as well.\nAnd I would say the third example is where there is a broader, deeper relationship where we think it might be prudent for us to form a joint venture in some form. And the most recent example of us doing that is with University of Massachusetts Medical Center, where we bought their outreach business but we also help them in many different ways in central Massachusetts. And so they actually have a small minority stake in that joint venture. So we're deeply embedded together in making that work in central Mass.\nSo all different sizes and shapes of how we work with hospital systems, which reflects the marketplace. I think part of our strategy here as well is what we're showing to the marketplace is we're a company and an organization that can manage in this very, very dynamic space. And you can work with Quest in whatever way makes sense. Obviously we want a deal that's going to work for both sides, but we are flexible and prudent in how we put together those relationships. But again, you see one deal, you see one deal. So hopefully that's helpful in providing a little bit more color...\nA. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC\nYeah, that's great. Let me \u2013 just a quick follow-up on a different area. So you had the asset sale this quarter and you stepped up the share repurchase as you've done before with other asset sales. When you think about capital deployment for the second half and moving forward, should we assume the share repurchase activity sort of settles back to what we saw in the first quarter? Or any other comments on direction of cash flow in the back half of the year?\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah, so I assume when you say cash flow, you mean cash utilization, A. J.?\nA. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC\nRight.\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nWhat you should assume is we'll follow our fifth point of our five-point strategy, so once we get through the ASR, which was really triggered as you pointed out by the monetization of the Focus Products business, we'll continue to either deploy towards M&A or towards share repurchases.\nObviously between the dividend and share repurchases we've done through the first half of the year, we've met our commitment of guaranteeing a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. So we've met that threshold. So the back half, depending on the timing and probability of executing any sort of deals, the cash flow will either be utilized for that, and if we don't have value-creating deals and we close in that timeframe, then we will \u2013 as opposed to sitting on the cash \u2013 we would do some additional repurchases.\nA. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC\nOkay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nIsaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nThanks, guys. Good morning.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nHi, Isaac.\nIsaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nHi, Steve. First question was kind of a longer-term item regarding PAMA. Just curious if the current state of PAMA legislation has had any impact on the nature of your conversations with private payers when it comes to negotiating your longer-term contracts with them.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nNo. It's an interesting topic, but frankly they're looking at our relationship, the term of that relationship, where any discussion around pricing should be. So very little relationship, if any, between what's happening with PAMA and the refresh of the lab fee schedule in our discussions with payers.\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah, we've gotten that question, Isaac, a number of times. I want to say again that there's very, very few contracts, if any, that are mechanically tied to Medicare rates. Yes, it's a reference point that people use in some discussions, but there's really \u2013 since there's not a mechanistic trigger, as Steve said, it's really not been a topic of conversation. They obviously want the best value. We're having discussions around the value that we bring them and the fact that we already have excellent pricing. That's more the focus of the conversation versus anything going on in the public sector reimbursement.\nIsaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nYeah, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up question on 2016 guidance, specifically for cash flow. I think your guidance does call for an acceleration in CapEx in the back half of this year just based on what we know you spent in the first half. So I'm wondering what that acceleration is related to, and then to what extent some of those dollars might be one time in nature that roll off in 2017? Thank you.\nMark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah, so when you say acceleration, we have had a historical pattern of spending more in the back half than the first half, so this year is not atypical. We are slightly lower this year versus last year by a little over $10 million for the first six months of the year. We're guiding to a number that's similar to slightly less than we spent last year, so I think it all fits, Isaac. It really has to do with the timing of some of the work that we're doing where we consume our capital, and certainly a part of that is some equipment refresh. Some of that is tied to our Invigorate program such as the lab standardization work, and it's really driven by when we're executing some of those conversions.\nSo really nothing unusual or atypical, I would say, in our capital spend this year, but I think the good news is that we're expecting to spend less this year than we did last year. And as we move forward, as we've mentioned, we're looking to get some of this high level of capital for Invigorate behind us and really return to a little lower level than we have versus the last couple years as a proportion of our total operating cash flow and as a proportion of risk.\nIsaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGot it. That makes sense. Thanks very much, guys.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our last question comes from building Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nWilliam Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC\nThanks.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nHey, Bill.\nWilliam Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC\nJust kind of a big picture question on the commercial contracting outlook going forward. I think we're coming up on 10 years of some of these preferred national relationships for the large labs and some of the largest payers. Obviously the payer landscape's changing pretty dramatically. At least one of those contracts, I believe, terms in 2018. I'm just curious how you think that situation plays out going forward. Do you think we continue to have a situation where you have certain payers aligned with certain national providers? Or do you think we move into a more open access kind of contracting situation over the next several years?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah. Well, first of all, Bill, thanks for the question. We're not going to comment on the specific contracts with some of our largest partners. But as we said before, we have hundreds of contracts so we're potentially working, and what happens every year with some of the refreshes on those contracts. And in that regard, we have our normal cadence of how we'll work through that this year, next year and into 2018.\nGenerally, given our leadership position in this marketplace, we're fortunate to be included in most of the healthcare insurance contracts throughout this country. And I think we're increasingly making it obvious it's good for patients, it's good for them attracting membership that they have Quest on contract.\nNow despite us maybe not having a preferred national relationship in some cases, we still continue to have strong working relationships with some of those healthcare insurance companies that we don't enjoy those relationships. And also, we continue to see other ways of working together with some of those systems. So I won't speculate on or give specifics on contract dates and timing of all that, but we're managing this in due course. And fortunately for us, we have a very strong position given our strength and position in this marketplace that collectively and collaborately we're part of the network of what's required in healthcare delivery throughout the country in a big way. And we have a good, strong seat at the table.\nWilliam Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC\nDo you want to elaborate at all, you said exploring alternative ways of working together, on what any of that might look like?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nSure. I mean, give an example. We have a big business measure around wellness. So our wellness business is a good business, we sell it directly to large employers but we also sell it to healthcare insurance companies. In selling it to healthcare insurance companies, they resell it. An example of that is we sell it to Aetna, we sell it to Cigna, but we also sell it to United Optum, as an example.\nWe also are perpetually asked for data. We test about 50% of adult Americans every year, excuse me in the course of three years. Having that data is quite important to healthcare insurance companies. So we're quite collaborative with the industry of serving up our data to help them manage some of their managed Medicaid or managed Medicare business in a collaborative way.\nSo, two examples. And the third example is with Inovalon, which is our data analytics product which is part of our new product introduction that we made this year around Quantum. We serve this up to all healthcare insurance companies, regardless of what we have for a laboratory contract. And so we're proactively working with all the companies that are taking risk, and so put this again in a different place with all healthcare insurance companies in a much different and broader way. So we often think about our laboratory contract, but our relationship with these systems are much broader than that.\nWilliam Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC\nPerfect. Thank you very much.\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThank you.\nShawn Bevec - Executive Director-Investor Relations\nOperator?\nStephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nSo thanks again for joining us on this call today. As you can tell, we're making very good progress executing our five-point strategy, and we appreciate your time, and look forward to seeing you in our travels. Have a good day.\nOperator\nThank you for participating in Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call.

Good morning, everybody. Next up, we have CSX, very happy to have Kevin Boone, who's the CFO here with us today. Lots obviously going on in the news this week and a cyclical volume recovery underway. So Kevin, I don't know if you have any opening comments or remarks or I can just start hitting you with questions?\nKevin Boone\nNo. I appreciate you having me. It feels full circle. This was my first conference when I joined CSX 3 years ago. So I was just reflecting on that this morning. It's obviously been a challenging year. I guess the good news is we're almost through 2020. So yes, let's go to the Q&A.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nQ - Allison Landry\nAll right. I'd love to start with the Pan Am. I know that you -- there's not much you can discuss regarding that. There's still the regulatory approval. Maybe you could just sort of frame for us the -- as much as you can, just sort of the strategic rationale? You guys have talked a lot about entrenching yourself in customer supply chains. So is that sort of the main driver behind this? Is there -- are the economics sort of sufficient from a single call it line perspective? What's -- how do we think about CSX engaging in this acquisition?\nKevin Boone\nYes. I mean, first and foremost, we did an incredible amount of work, as you can imagine. We have a great team on the finance side, operations. Every part of our business due diligence on this transaction, and we obviously saw a lot of value in it. That's why we're here today and made the announcement this week. Jamie went up to the network. Really did a lot of -- he high-railed the whole network, really got a sense on what the opportunities might be there. We think from a customer service perspective, there's a lot of opportunity to add a lot of value there. And there are some investments we can make to grow the business over the long-term as well. So as Jim says, when you can touch water, those are very, very valuable assets. And so we see a lot of value there over the long term, medium term. And they have a great team that we -- they helped us understand the opportunities that exist and what we can really do in the network, and we think there's some very good growth. If you look historically, they've been able to grow a little bit faster than our -- what we've been able to achieve. So we think the growth profile is attractive for us. And we're excited about what we can do on top of that.\nAllison Landry\nIs this like a sort of, what's the right word, a template for how to think about -- I mean, obviously, you want, what we've said before, just getting deeper within the customer supply chains. Is this sort of a bigger lever going forward? I say, Pan Am is the largest regional rail. I'm not sure how many of those are out there like that. Is this is more of a one-off? Or do you think that sort of short line M&A in general is a catalyst for CSX, but also just the U.S. Class Is to really start to chip away at the volume that's been lost to truck over the last couple of decades. How do we think about it?\nKevin Boone\nYes. I think Pan Am was probably more of a unique situation in terms of short lines. I don't think you could look for us to be big buyers in that market necessarily over the next few years. There are assets that come up that are unique and are fit, we'll certainly look at those. But I wouldn't read into anything there in terms of more transactions on that side. We're always looking at ways where we can strengthen our core franchise, offer more value to our customers. If there are things we can do, we do them today with our TRANSFLO business. We do it with our auto business, where we have some value-added services as part of the move that we offer. And so as to your point, if we can get more embedded with our customers, get that business more sticky, that's what our customers more and more want from us. We'll look at those things. Warehousing all those things are impossible. We have a great real estate franchise. We can leverage in that as well.\nAllison Landry\nOkay. Are you guys still in the process of selling any branch lines? Or is that sort of largely over? I think Jim actually said at RailTrends a couple of weeks ago that he's like, look, we're -- well, we're probably not sellers. We don't want to cut our fingers off, we want to grow. So is that a fair characterization that there's not much to do as far as sort of rationalizing the network going forward?\nKevin Boone\nYes. I think that's right. There are really -- there are real reasons why we sold off some of those short lines the last two years. I think they -- from a strategic standpoint, they made a lot more sense in others' hands. We probably don't see as many opportunities going forward for that. And quite frankly, our operating team is best-in-class. And rather than have more railroad to run because we think there's a lot of value that can be created there.\nAllison Landry\nMakes sense. All right maybe just sort of skipping around it, I just wanted to talk about the current volume trends. It seems like every week, the quarter-to-date year-over-year growth rate gets a little bit better. And I think, obviously, intermodal has been a driver. You've seen sort of upticks in other parts of the business. Could you just maybe sort of talk about if there's any commodity types or end markets that are trending either better than you initially expected or worse? And then we can sort of segue that into maybe thinking about the 2021 volume outlook?\nKevin Boone\nYes. Certainly, when you look at intermodal, that's been obviously in the high single digits around 9%, 10%. We're trending right now, it's a testament to what the consumer market is doing right now. We talk about low inventories, the restocking that's taking place. My youngest son won't get his bike from Santa this year because there's no bikes available. But we have -- there's a lot of replenishment. We think -- I think Mark talked about it at the last conference, we probably see some continued momentum into the first quarter. We'll see beyond that where the economy goes. But there's clearly a lot of restocking. You can see the poor data, I know you look at that all the time. It's -- we're hitting record days of volume here on our intermodal side, despite all the things that we've done over the last 2 years when we rationalized some of the lanes. So it's a testament to what we've done. Now we're handling more volume than we ever have. So it makes me -- I think when we look back, we did all the right things before and really optimizing the intermodal network and what Jamie was able to do, creating this point-to-point network was pretty incredible. And I think it's paying huge dividends right now. \nOn the merchandise side versus third quarter, we're, certainly in certain markets, starting to see some stabilization, I would say, chemicals. You see the car loads. Those are trending up. The metals and equipment, a little bit better trend there. Again, these things -- the volatility right now is pretty uncertain. We just went through Thanksgiving. What does that mean for the pandemic? And what -- I just saw Los Angeles had a shelter in place by the Mayor there. So what does that mean for business activity? Even like 2 or 3 weeks out from now, it makes it incredibly challenging. \nWe have to go into 2021 right now. So we're thinking a lot about what that looks like, and it's -- we were summarizing all the macro analysts out there and what their forecasts are. We have some that are forecasting high single-digit industrial production growth and some that are down mid-single digits. It's -- I've never seen it so wide in terms of what the expectations are out there. So it makes it hard to predict going into next year, what is the second half of 2021 really, really look like? How quick do we get the vaccines out and those kind of things? What we have been looking at a lot is in the trailing 4, 6 weeks trend and what does that really imply on a go-forward basis when you overlay the seasonality. \nAnd right now, if you look at that and you can do the math as well, it's kind of that mid-single-digit revenue growth for next year. We'll see where the next 2 or 3 weeks trend and -- but we have to adapt. I know from Jamie's perspective, it's incredibly difficult when you overlay, we have a lot of employees out, almost 200 employees that are out related to COVID right now, and they have been in pockets. And we're having have to adjust the network and to really work around that. Incredible amount of challenges he's had to work through this year on that side. And it's hard. It's hard to predict where things are trending. But it's nice to see now here in the fourth quarter that we have some stabilization in some of these markets. Clearly, first quarter is probably a little bit difficult comp because you will remember, we didn't have the pandemic impact until really late in that March -- month of March, and it started with the auto franchise really first coming off and coal was probably a little bit of a headwind in the first quarter, but then the comps get...\nAllison Landry\nComps get easy.\nKevin Boone\nIn the second quarter. And then what does the second half look like? From there, are we going to get another uptick in the economy? And how does that play out? What I do know is, we're two years into an industrial recession. This all started in 2019, if you remember. And so when the economy recovers, I think we'll participate in a very meaningful way.\nAllison Landry\nMaybe staying on the topic of merchandise, you guys have outlined this for a while, just in terms of the opportunity longer-term to -- because of the better service and improved time metrics and trip compliance that really can start to chip away at gaining share from truck. And it seems like you guys have been able to do that for several quarters. It's just been masked by everything, just volumes being down so much. But when you think forward, and I don't know if this is a 2021 or beyond that type of sort of framework. But can you grow merchandise 1% or 2% better than the industrial economy? Is that something that could happen based on the share gains or contract wins that you've seen so far? Could that happen in 2021? Or is that too optimistic?\nKevin Boone\nWhen you hear Jim and Mark, absolutely. That's what we're trying to do here. When you talk about the truck inversion expanding the addressable market, utilizing the better service, which opens up new business for us. That's exactly what we've been keen on. So if you listened to Mark last conference to Jim, that's the goal. We want to change the growth trajectory of what we've been able to do in the past and get on a new trajectory going forward. Now what we can't control is the economy. We can't control how much IP grows next year. But we have every -- we have aspirations to grow above that. There's no question about it.\nAllison Landry\nOkay. I mean, I would imagine, at least the truck -- the tight truck market is probably helping those conversations. But like longer-term to really penetrate merchandise that is currently going on truck that should economically move by rail, what needs to happen? I think at recent sort of industry conferences, the main things that shippers focus on are, of course, reliability, consistency, reduced variability. They want to know where their freight is. And they want more proactive sort of outreach and solutions from marketing customer service. So when you -- obviously, you've had the service improvement in terms of on-time performance as well as improved trip plan compliance. But is that enough? What's the next big thing that you think needs to happen to really start to move the needle as far as those share gains?\nKevin Boone\nYes. First of all, when I reflect on what's happened with the truck market here in the last several months is, similar to a lot of other mega trends when I think about e-commerce and the Amazon growth that you're seeing in their business and other things, we had this driver supply that's been out there, right? And I think what we've really done here in this market and with COVID and everything you probably accelerated that trend where the driver shortage is really playing out here. And you're all seeing it. We have a number of customers that have come to us and that are more long-term thinkers and said, \"Hey, we're really worried about this over the next few years that are really out in front of it.\" And what you -- I think what you're seeing is really not being pulled forward here on that side. So it's certainly, I think, an opportunity for us going forward to continue to convert that business as we move forward. So I think we're pretty excited about that.\nAllison Landry\nAnd what about -- so as far as like the tracking and tracing and customers wanting that visibility. I know you guys have your platform ShipCSX. Could you talk about how far along you are in developing that and rolling it out to customers? Is there sort of further improvements that need to happen? So could just talk about sort of that platform and then your sort of marketing efforts towards that visibility to give to customers?\nKevin Boone\nYes. I think we're on the leading edge of -- certainly from a ShipCSX and given the trip plan compliance visibility to our customers where they can literally track their freight through our network is pretty cutting edge. And I oversee, obviously the capital budget, and we've spent a lot of dollars there. And I think it's going to pay off. Customers want that visibility. It keeps us honest. It keeps the customer honest. There's accountability on both sides. And it helps us identify additional opportunities when they are able to see that. We can -- for new business, we can literally go in and show them our performance on a lane in a credible way and say, this is what we do today, and this is what we deliver for other customers. That, I think, really, really helps the customer acquisition discussions and driving more volume. \nWhen you talk about reliability and the opportunity to continue to really capture more customer share, first of all, I think they need to see it for a period of time. And I think we're showing them that today. Our team, Bill pointed out to me, he looked back when we first started trip plan compliance in 2017, over -- around 20% of our loads over two days or great are late. \nToday, that number, when you look at the magnitude of the misses, we count every miss as a miss, right? When you look at the trip plan compliance, no matter if it missed 2 days, 3 days, 4 days or 1 hour or even 5 minutes, it all accounts the same in that number. But when you look at the over 2 days late, that's gone from 20% to low single digits today. And so that variability in our -- in the business is really, really shrunkier and that customer experience has gotten significantly better. But you have to prove it over time. In these markets, where truck's tight and we can prove that we have a good, reliable service, they're going to reflect on that, I think, as a customer and say, I feel confident I can give CSX more business going forward.\nAllison Landry\nAll right. Maybe switching just to the cost side or maybe back up. So it seems like, at least from what we can tell right now, volumes, hopefully, will be positive in 2021. Obviously, still a lot of uncertainty. But thinking about what you guys have done as far as structural cost reductions and even sort of since COVID started uncovering different opportunities and ways to improve efficiency and train length and train weight, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, so as I put all that together and sort of barring an economic shock, I mean, is it feasible to think about a mid-50s OR in 2021?\nKevin Boone\nI knew you were going to go there.\nAllison Landry\nI have to ask.\nKevin Boone\nWell, first of all, I don't want to get on -- what we're really trying to do is grow operating income at a very high returns, right? And so -- and I hate to -- I know others have said this before, but we're certainly not turning away 60 OR new business with the goal of hitting a 55. As Jim will say, he'll tell you today, like we can get to 55 today. But our revenue base is probably -- looks different, lower. So the goal is to grow really profitably. And it goes without saying, probably going forward, growth is going to be a bigger contributor of that operating income growth than it probably has been over the last 3 years. \nAnd we have a lot of confidence that, that can really play out. But it goes without saying also that we have incremental margins that are very, very good. When you look at third quarter, who would have thought 3 years ago that I would tell you, we had a quarter where intermodal contributed the most to our revenue in our history on a percentage basis, and coal, the least. And yet we hit a record OR in the quarter. That's -- I think that's fundamentally changed the game, and it's all a testament to what we did with the network and what Jamie and his team on the operating side have really done. That incremental intermodal revenue drops through at a very, very good attractive margin. And we're pretty proud of that. \nSo going forward, of course, I think it is going to be volume-dependent going into next year. We feel confident if revenue is higher than what we expect, and incremental margins are going to be very, very attractive. There are always things that we have to offset in any given year. Inflation will be slightly higher going into next year than it was this year, but still probably lower than the 3 to 5-year average. You have depreciation, as you know, always a headwind. Our CapEx is above depreciation. This is our industry phenomenon. Fortunately, our CapEx is not as much above depreciation as others. So maybe a little bit less of a headwind long term. I'd like to point that out as well. And then we have things like real estate taxes that are based on our profitability. And so the profitability has gotten meaningfully better. It goes up on a lag basis. So we'll have to offset all of those. So before we get started, we have to offset some of these costs, and we think we can do it with some productivity. But certainly, it's a volume story going forward. \nWe're planning, we have to build in some -- on the Op side, some variability in terms of hiring. We're starting to look to hire to backfill some attrition. So if that volume does surprise to the upside, we're there to really handle it, as you know. And when volume surprises have happened in the industry, we have a history of not really handling that really well. And so we want to disprove that this time around.\nAllison Landry\nSo that's I think a good sort of line question. So I'm not like -- I mean, is it -- are you finding it difficult, whether it's just related to the spike in COVID or volumes coming back, is it getting more challenging from a hiring standpoint or recalling employees from furlough? Like you just mentioned, like do -- how much do you sort of need to get ahead of the attrition? And what could be strong growth next year, so that you're not caught short? So maybe if you could just sort of talk about how to think about labor? And then the service metrics have deteriorated a little bit. I don't know if it's sort of related to some of the employees that we were talking about that sort of are going on in clusters, if there's anything there? Or if it's just pure volumes? Maybe if you could talk about all of those things?\nKevin Boone\nYes. We certainly -- on the COVID side, we will have spikes in different areas, and it's a huge challenge. You can't move employees around. If all of a sudden an area like Birmingham has a spike in COVID cases, it's not like you can take employees from another area and move them in to run the railroad. It just doesn't work that way. \nThe union contracts don't allow for that. So it inhibits our flexibility there. So Jamie and team to move this amount of volume that we are right now, given all the challenges is a testament to everything. When you talk about the service metrics, I think we've taken this year -- we're tweaking, right? We're looking at train length as a trade-off between speed and are there some cases where you want to make that trade-off? I think the numbers will show that that's probably the case in some instances. It's gotten us a chance with the lower volume to really tweak the network. And Jamie and his team really looked at that. And I think it's really paying dividends right now. We have expectations that we'll get better, no question. Are we satisfied where we are today? We aren't. We have aspirations to get better and better. We think we have clear line of sight to that. These COVID problems are challenging. \nFrom a hiring perspective, look, these are attractive jobs, well paid jobs. I think it's always -- I think the biggest challenge is the lead time to get a conductor or an engineer qualified. So from start to finish, it's months of training to get qualified on the railroad. So you have to anticipate that. So you will have to hire for 6 months ahead. And that's what we're thinking about right now. We have a 6% to 7% attrition every year. So we need to get ahead of that as well. And overall, we're -- you could be up -- according to some of the IP estimates, you could be up high single digits or others where you could be down mid-single digits, it's incredibly difficult to manage from a resource perspective. But we're talking more about as a team being prepared to really react to that upside surprise if it comes.\nAllison Landry\nOkay. Maybe just turning to CapEx. Any sort of initial thoughts on 2021? Do you expect it to sort of -- your sort of overall level of spending to remain kind of flattish? And what longer term, like, as you guys start to chip away at share gains from truck and grow volumes, what's the right level of CapEx to sales or on a GTM basis without sacrificing growth? I know there's -- you guys have a lot of capacity that has been built in with the PSR implementation. But how do we think about that short term and then longer term?\nKevin Boone\nYes. We'll give the official guidance maybe here in January, we'll talk about that. But what I've always said about CapEx and what we've been trying to do over the last year, since I've been in this role is really putting a lot of rigor around the projects, having accountability on the back end, looking at the returns, does it make sense? How are we prioritizing the highest return projects? As an organization, I don't think historically, we valued when we come in and really been successful on a capital project versus saving money on the OE side, which obviously reflects in our operating performance from an income statement perspective and the things that you look at. But really, it's getting that -- Jamie's highly focused on it on his side is on the engineering side, we've gotten -- when you look at our performance there and our cost per TIH, Ricky's team on the engineering side has done a fantastic job. And what we've done is with the lower volume this year, we plowed that back into the railroad. When we had less volume, we decided to accelerate some of the capital that we needed to do there, and we'll continue to do that a bit here going forward. \nMy goal is to avoid the volatility in our capital, particularly on the maintenance side. So we feel pretty good about these levels, a little bit step-up in the locomotive rebuild program, not huge, probably going into next year, some step-up in bridges. But really, nothing on the maintenance, the core infrastructure spend that you see there. We have pretty good line of sight over a multiyear period, whether it's the railroad, the locomotives, all that core infrastructure. Where we really also focused on is using some of that savings and really accelerating some of our technology spend. We'll spend more on automation next year than we did this year. And I would like to do that more and more going forward, using some of the savings that we drive on the maintenance side, on the core capital and redeploying it on the technology side. So highly focused on that. We've been looking at that for the last 6 months, really going to try to accelerate that. \nIf there are opportunities to pull forward, we have plenty of cash. If we find opportunities with very high returns, I'm more than willing to spend the capital. But I feel pretty good about the levels that we're at with no major spike coming in the future.\nAllison Landry\nOkay. I mean, just on the topic of technologies, this has come up in pretty much all the rail fireside chats that I've done, CN talks a lot about their automated inspection portals. Keith has talked about it, doing it a little bit differently than in the way CN is doing it. Where are you guys on things like that as far as like the portals or the automated track inspection or predictive maintenance? Where is CSX in that? And what makes sense as far as your network as -- when we're thinking about different technology investments?\nKevin Boone\nWe do it all. We're doing it all. You talked to Jamie, we have the inspection portals. We have -- we're adding another one in Waycross. We're creating the algorithms. We're really working through that. We feel like we're in the leading edge of all of these technologies and adapting them on the inspection side, huge, huge improvements. And when I look at the inspection side on the tract side, it's really going to help us over the next few years, deploy our capital in a much more efficient way. I'm incredibly excited about that. When I think about $1 billion of capital we're putting in, in our railroad. And if we can use data in a more impactful way where it identifies where we really should be replacing it, I -- what I know today is we're probably repricing some rail too early, right? And if we can get better at that at identifying where the opportunities are there, there are savings there to go after. \nFrom an automated train perspective, Jamie will tell you that he believes we'll be the first in the industry to be able to run a train from 0 to 0 as they call. And the first benefits of that will be further fuel savings. We think there's still a lot of opportunity on the fuel side. Even though we're best-in-class in the U.S., which we like to point out from an ESG perspective, it's a huge opportunity to go to customers and say, we're the most efficient railroad in the U.S. There's a lot of pressure from investors and others to -- for people to meet their emission standards and those things. We're the solution. When we have those discussions. So we have every expectation we're going to be -- continue to be leaders there. And we're spending more and more capital, as I mentioned, on technology every year. \nI know Jamie and the entire leadership team is challenging us, bring us ideas. We got to prioritize things. We're willing to make multiyear investments to get the opportunity. When you think about inspection, that's multiyear investments. We're investing in our dispatching system today. That will have big benefits over a multiyear period. So I just went through a technology discussion on the cloud and the migration on the cloud, we're looking at those things over time. Those have really substantial benefits to us as well. \nSo there's a lot of momentum on the technology side in all parts of our business that I think you'll see us really leverage over the next few years, but they're not necessarily next year savings. They're the things you have to invest in overtime in order to really get the real value.\nAllison Landry\nOkay. Maybe I'll sneak one last one in. Just any thoughts on capital allocation, buybacks versus the dividend? Obviously, you guys are spinning out quite a bit of free cash flow, and that probably only gets better. So if you could just sort of talk about how you guys are prioritizing after Capex, obviously?\nKevin Boone\nYes. We have a history of liking both. We have a history of -- if you look out the last few years of raising our dividend. These are always Board discussions that we go through every year. But I'd point back to history on the dividend. And then certainly, returning cash to shareholders has been a priority for us, and that will continue to be our priority. If there are investments we can make that have very high returns, we'll do that as well. We have -- we're fortunate enough to have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. And we expect we'll continue to generate really high levels of free cash flow, which, as you know, we continue to highlight as a differentiator versus our peer group.\nAllison Landry\nCheap as on a free cash flow basis, right?\nKevin Boone\nThat's right. That's right. Hey, you're listening to me.\nAllison Landry\nYes, exactly. All right. Kevin, thank you so much. This was great. I hope your meetings go well the rest of the day, and really appreciate you taking all the time with us. Take care.\n\n",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Sullivan\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining Applied\u2019s second quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings call, which is being recorded.\nJoining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied\u2019s Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC.\nToday\u2019s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today\u2019s earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings presentation, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.\nAnd now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.\nGary Dickerson\nThanks, Mike. I'd like to start today's call by addressing the topic at the forefront of everyone's mind, the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created unprecedented challenges around the world. My thoughts and best wishes go out to all of you and especially those whose families have been directly affected by the illness. As the situation has evolved over the past several months, our actions at Applied Materials have been guided by two key principles. First, maintaining the trust of our employees, customers, suppliers, and partners. And second, focusing on driving initiatives that will allow us to emerge stronger over the longer term.\nAs always, our number one priority is the health and wellbeing of our employees and their families. Our workforce remains highly productive, many are working effectively from home and for those working on site, we've implemented strict safety protocols, in close collaboration with our medical advisors, customers and suppliers. In our factories, labs and logistics centers, we've changed physical layouts to allow for social distancing, introduced enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures, implemented health screenings and mandated the use of personal protective equipment.\nAll our employees and contingent workers have continued to receive full pay and we've introduced additional incentives and benefits for employees supporting our critical operations. While we've been working through certain supply chain constraints, we have remained laser focused on the needs of our customers and doing what it takes to keep their factories running smoothly and their R&D programs on track. \nAcross the company, I see amazing examples of our manufacturing, logistics, and field operations teams going above and beyond to keep our customers and the industry moving forward in a difficult set of circumstances. We're also defining new ways of working with customers that not only provide solutions today, but will also create significant benefits over the long term. \nFinally, in line with Applied's long held values to make a positive contribution to the communities where we live and work. We've created a global charitable COVID fund. The purpose of this fund is to address immediate humanitarian needs and combat long-term effects on local communities and the non-profit sector. We've also donated masks and equipment to medical facilities. And in addition, there have been numerous employee driven initiatives across the company. It's inspiring to see these employees stepping forward to help volunteering their time, skills and resources to demonstrate our shared passion to make a difference. \nNow, let me turn to the agenda for today's call. I'll begin with a summary of our second quarter performance and near-term outlook. Then I'll provide a longer-term perspective on our markets. And I'll finish with a summary of our strategy highlighting some of our recent accomplishments. Later, Dan will give more color on our financial results, operational performance and business environment. \nStarting with our near term business outlook demand from our semiconductor customers remains strong. In fiscal Q2, our financial performance was negatively affected by our ability to ship systems to customers as shelter in place and locked down orders impacted some of our suppliers\u2019 operations, particularly in the Bay Area and Malaysia. However, we're in a much better position today. Thanks to the flexibility in our global operations footprint, we've been able to make adjustments. And we continue to work closely with our suppliers to ensure they can meet our needs. Our supply chain remains a critical area of focus as we enter our third quarter with record orders and a record backlog for our semiconductor and service businesses combined.\nIn terms of the semiconductor industry environment, I will focus my comments on what we currently see in the market and what we're hearing from customers. In foundry/logic demand at the leading edge remains very healthy with a strong commitment from these customers to build out their factories and push forward with their development road maps.\nHowever, we're seeing some pockets of weakness in specialty markets, mainly as a result of a pullback in the automotive and industrial sectors. In memory, there are no major changes to the outlook we provided last quarter. We continue to see a positive progression in the market with inventory levels, approaching normal and improvements in pricing trends. \nAs a result, we're seeing incremental strength in investment by memory customers as we move through the year. Based on the visibility that we have today, underlying demand for semiconductor equipment is robust.\nAnd even when COVID-related effects are taking into account, we still believe that our semiconductor business can deliver strong double digit growth for our fiscal year. In display, we expect our FY 2020 revenues to be close to FY 2019 as the industry navigates the bottom of this spending cycle. \nOur display business remains solidly profitable, even as we invest in next generation products ready for when the market picks up. Looking further out, we're well aware of global economic concerns. While I'm not going to speculate on possible macro scenarios, I will share some of the key assumptions that we're using to guide our strategy, which are based on carefully monitoring market indicators and staying very close to our customers.\nClearly, consumer spending is a potential headwind for many sectors, including the electronics industry. At the same time, the global pandemic is acting as an accelerator for key technology inflections that were already under way. Working from home, learning from home and e-commerce are driving investments in cloud data centers and communications infrastructure. We expect companies to build stronger business continuity plans, which will include geographic redundancy and increased use of automation and IoT technologies and the adoption of AI and big data remains non-discretionary for many companies. As I've said before, these game changing technologies will transform entire industries and there will be big winners and losers through the transition.\nMy personal view is that we will see significant and permanent changes in the way companies operate and prioritize their investments. In fact, this is already happening in our business and the ways we are working with customers. Over the past several years, we made significant investments in state-of-the art, digital infrastructure, sensors, and metrology, data science, machine learning and simulation. \nThe combination of these technologies enables us to reduce product development cycles, speed up transfer of new technologies from lab to fab and optimize cost output and yield for our customers and volume production. In the past few months, our field and R&D teams have been working with customers to further expand secured data sharing, to enhance remote support and accelerate the deployment of these powerful new tools.\nIn our own labs, we also have many examples of R&D teams increasing utilization and productivity of lab assets, by applying creative new strategies for mode operations. While near-term actions are being driven by necessity, the long-term benefits of working this way are compelling as they provide significant time to market and cost advantages for Applied and our customers. Our long-term perspective about AI and big data shaping the next decade is unchanged.\nAnd we see strong potential for certain elements of these inflections to scale faster than previously expected. As I've said before, to enable these new computing systems and unlock the potential of AI technologies, major advances in the power, performance, and area of cost or PPAC of semiconductor devices are needed. \nBased on recent input from customers, we've updated our PPAC framework to PPACT, where T stands for time to market, acknowledging the enormous value of speed. Applied has by far, the largest broad portfolio of technologies and products to accelerate the PPACT playbook which spans creating, shaping, modifying, analyzing and connecting structures and devices. We're the only company with process and metrology under one roof. And we have highly differentiated silicon and packaging lab capabilities. As a result, we have a significant advantage in our ability to accelerate new PPACT innovations for the semiconductor ecosystem. The capabilities we have built and the multi-year investments we have made are yielding results.\nAccording to VLSI Research\u2019s recently published report. We outperformed the market in both semiconductor equipment and services last year. Our performance in deposition technology was especially strong with our PVD business gaining seven points of share. We also have great momentum in metrology and inspection. Our process diagnostics and control group delivered record revenue in the first half of the year. One of the key contributors to this record performance is our new optical inspection system that we will be officially launching later this year.\nBefore I hand the call over to Dan, I will quickly summarize. First as we navigate the challenges created by COVID-19, we've rallied the company around two guiding principles, maintain the trust of employees, customers, suppliers, and partners, and focus on driving actions that ensure Applied Materials emerges stronger over the longterm. \nSecond while we're mindful of potential macroeconomic headwinds, based on what we see and hear today, semiconductor equipment demand remains robust and our supply chain is getting healthier. Third, we remain fully committed to our strategy to accelerate the PPACT playbook and our pipeline of new innovative products and integrated processes has never been better. \nNow, I will turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Durn\nThanks, Gary. Today, I'll summarize our second quarter results and activities. Give you an update on the environment and share our current expectations for the second half of our fiscal year. As a reminder on March 23, we suspended our Q2 guidance because of the global response to COVID-19 was creating significant challenges across our supply chain, manufacturing, operations, and logistics. Due to the extreme uncertainty, we also decided to borrow against our revolving credit facility. We promised to provide our investors with an update on this earnings webcast, and I'll do that in a moment.\nThis afternoon, we announced our Q2 results, which were below our original guidance, but solid considering the extreme challenges our teams faced due to COVID. I'm proud of our employees for putting health and safety first and still doing everything possible to support our customers, both in keeping our factories running and by keeping our R&D programs moving.\nDespite the incremental challenges we experienced in the last six weeks of our quarter, we delivered AGS and display revenue that was higher than our original expectations in February. Our semi systems revenue was below our original outlook, and that was entirely due to COVID-related supply constraints and demand remains strong. And while the environment remains fluid, we exited the quarter with the second highest company backlog in our history and record backlog for semi systems plus AGS combined.\nFor the company as a whole in Q2 on a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue by 12%, increased non-GAAP operating profit by 23% and grew non-GAAP EPS by 27% to $0.89. During the quarter, we returned $392 million to shareholders in buybacks and dividends and announced a dividend increase of nearly 5%. We ended Q2 with nearly $7.4 billion on the balance sheet, including $1.5 billion in credit facility proceeds.\nNow I'll share my assessment of the COVID environment, which includes several encouraging developments. Our industry has been designated critical infrastructure in many parts of the world. All of our suppliers have now been able to resume operations and they were recovering to normal output. We've been in very close communications with our customers and their demand indications remained strong. \nWe're mindful of the macro economic impacts of COVID including job losses in the consumer and industrial sectors of the global economy. But governments have provided strong financial support to workers, businesses and the banking system. As a result of our assessment of the environment, we fully repaid our revolving credit facility, borrowings subsequent to the end of the quarter. We currently have approximately $5.9 billion of cash and investments on the balance sheet, which is an increase of about $200 million compared to our Q1 balance. We are continuing to prepare for the planned acquisition of Kokusai Electric. During Q2, we received Taiwan's clearance for the transaction, and we have one final approval pending from China. Turning to the business outlook, while I see positive signs, there is still potential for COVID-related disruptions around the world, and we're not providing revenue and earnings guidance for Q3.\nI know there is concern about the risk of further economic impacts and changes in customer investment patterns, but rather than speculate, I'll attempt to help our investors by providing visibility into what we are seeing across our operating segments. \nIn semiconductor systems, our Q2 revenue would have been nearly $650 million higher absent COVID related constraints. We hope to recover this revenue in Q3 and Q4 as the supply chain improves. In the second quarter our semi systems orders were up significantly and demand is broadening to more customers based on what we're hearing from our customers. We believe Q3 semi revenue could be up in the high single digits, sequentially and higher again in Q4 resulting in strong double digit growth for the fiscal year.\nOur services business has proven highly resilient during the crisis, and we continue to generate a growing proportion of revenue from subscription like long-term service agreements. AGS posted its first $1 billion dollar quarter ever in Q2 with nearly 60% of revenue coming from service agreements. In Q3, we believe AGS revenue could be flat to slightly higher sequentially and higher again in Q4. Within AGS, our semi parts and services business has grown to $3.2 billion or 24% of our company's semi-related revenue. \nVLSI research has begun to size and compare the parts and service revenue of companies in the industry. Ours is the strongest among our peers, both on a dollar basis and as a percent of our semi-related revenue. Our total semiconductor installed based business, which includes parts, services, 200-millimeter systems and 300-millimeter upgrades and refurbs has grown to become 38% of our semi-related revenue.\nThis ratio is about five points higher than our peers. As Gary indicated, we still expect our display revenue to be nearly the same this year as last. We believe revenue is likely to be flat to slightly higher sequentially in Q3 and higher again in Q4. In short, if the demand indications from our customers hold and our supply chains continue to improve, then we should have second half weighted revenue in each segment. Based on everything we see today, this would translate to sequential revenue growth and earnings growth in Q3, and then again in Q4.\nSo in summary, while the situation remains fluid and macroeconomic impacts are still unknown, our customers remain committed to their technology roadmaps and are signaling growth for Applied. We will remain vigilant, stay close to our customers and be ready to respond quickly if the environment changes. Once again, I'm incredibly proud of our employees for their strong commitment to health and safety and their strong support of our customers, both in meeting today's demand that our factories and theirs and innovating in our R&D labs to enable the technology of the future.\nNow, Mike let's begin the Q&A.\nMichael Sullivan\nThanks, Dan. There are a lot of people on the call today. So to help us reach as many of you as we can, I'm going to ask you to please ask just one question and not more than one brief followup.\nOperator, let's please begin.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nC.J. Muse\nYes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you talked about expectations for incremental strength from memory through the calendar year. I was hoping perhaps you could elaborate on that in terms of mix between both NAND and DRAM as well as new wafer starts versus strengths. And what gives you the confidence that, that is sustainable in this world of COVID?\nGary Dickerson\nThanks, C.J. As we look into the year, we see the year profiling pretty similar from a proportion of spend standpoint that we talked about a quarter ago. We see strength in foundry/logic continuing throughout the year as our order book and customer base broadens, and we feel good about that. As we profile to memory, we talked about seeing some incremental strength this year, both on DRAM and NAND. I think it's too early to call the magnitude of that, but we do see balance across the device types from a spend standpoint. And I do think there is going to be similarities in terms of 2019 being an investment year, primarily focused on technology road maps. \nAnd we actually saw wafer starts per month last year, 2019, actually go down year-over-year in both DRAM and NAND. And as we look into this year, we don't really see strong capacity adds. We continue to see our customers driving their technology road maps. Because that is, in effect, their cost structure. It allows them to drive margins and cash flow when industries recover. So we see continued investments from a technology road map standpoint, but we see probably less wafer starts per month coming out of the system than we did the year before.\nSo it's sort of on the margin. We continue to stay close. We will watch it. And we'll continue to be open and transparent. In an environment that's defined by uncertainty, what we want to try to do is be as helpful as possible, share with investors the things we're seeing and hearing from our customers and we'll let you know what we see each quarter as the situation evolves.\nC.J. Muse\nThat's helpful. If I could sneak a quick follow-up, Mike. On gross margins, can you speak to how you see the trajectory into the second half considering what looks to be a positive mix from both silicon and AGS? And also as it relates to supply chain, I think you took out $8 million of COVID-related expenses. Is that something that should sustain into the back half? How should we be thinking about that? Thanks.\nGary Dickerson\nThanks, C.J. I'll take both. As we think about the actions the company took in the current environment, we made conscious decisions about how we were going to position ourselves from an operating and manufacturing standpoint and decisions were made very early in the process. We implemented our business continuity team in the middle of January. And as part of contingency planning and mapping out potential points of risk, we made decisions to put in place surge capacity from a personnel standpoint. And that decision was made probably the first week of February.\nSo clearly there is an impact to maintain cycle times and throughputs that are on par with where we were before COVID. That's a result of really strong teamwork and execution and planning. But it certainly has a headwind from a margin standpoint. And we're optimizing around serving our customers and taking care of the things that we can take care of so we can better withstand the things we can't control which is what we saw from a supply chain disruption standpoint and the rate and pace of that recovery. So we feel good about that. But certainly it does create a bit of a headwind. And you see that profiling through some of the segments and I'm happy to share more of that thinking, but it's definitely there.\nFrom a gross margin standpoint, as we look into next quarter what we signaled was a favorable segment mix and in a normal environment that would create improvement from a gross margin standpoint. What I'd also say is what we experienced in our most recent quarter was six weeks of impact of a material supply chain disruption driven by a concurrent shelter-in-place order in the Bay Area and Malaysia. It affected a material part of our supply chain, but it was a six-week impact.\nGoing into Q3, we've got a full 13-week impact as the supply chain becomes healthier and that will sort of offset a bit of the favorable segment mix. So I think the best way to think about our gross margin as we look into Q3 from a planning assumption standpoint is to think about it flat. If we can do better, we certainly will. But we'll take it one quarter at a time and give investors our best view of what we see and the pluses and minuses as we manage the business to the best of our ability in this environment.\nMichael Sullivan\nThanks, C.J.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open.\nAtif Malik\nThank you for taking my questions. I have two. First for Gary. Company gained 0.5 point of equipment share last year and served variable markets led by deposition. Which end markets or technologies are you more confident to show outsized growth this year and next year? And as a follow-up, Dan, I'm curious what your take is on recent Department of Commerce's China equipment licensees for the future shipments.\nGary Dickerson\nThanks for the question. I think I'll take both of those. So let me start with market share. And starting from an overall company perspective, one of the things that we've discussed before is that we have very good balance across all device segments, including leading and trailing logic, DRAM and NAND. This enables us to perform well really regardless of the device mix. It gives us ability to perform well in pretty much any environment.\nSo if we look at overall, 2019 was a good year for us. Your question I think is related to 2020. We look at 2020 as also a very good setup for us. As I said in the prepared remarks, we anticipate strong double-digit growth for Applied in 2020. And what I would say is that in this new environment, I used to travel a significant amount. And I'm still on the phone very frequently with CEOs, R&D leaders. In fact, I had a call with one of the CEOs this morning. And one of the things that's a real advantage for Applied is the traction we have with customers to accelerate their PPACT road maps. And that really is both for memory and also for foundry and logic.\nSo performance in 2019, we gained about two points in the markets that we serve and a 0.5 point overall WFE share. So if we look at the setup for 2020, we continue to see strong foundry/logic investments where we have leadership products, PVD, epi, strong traction in new etch applications. We see currently double-digit growth in our memory business, strong double-digit growth in memory, gaining traction with new capabilities that are key for scaling and strong growth in memory patterning applications. So overall, again we have balance across all of these different segments. I would say that our pipeline of our new products in our integrated materials solutions has never been better relative to accelerating PPACT road maps for customers.\nThen the second question is around, I think the export controls. So let me start with a perspective of the overall geopolitical situation. And I've said before on this one, Applied believes in fair trade and intellectual property protection. The semi ecosystem and innovation road map rely on these principles. \nSo regarding the new regulations that were recently announced by the Department of Commerce, we're working very closely with the U.S. government, trade associations and our advisors to better define the requirements for the industry and to be able to comply with the new regulations. We have some very good people working on this and based on our work to-date, our current expectation is Applied is going to be able to meet the government's required standards when the rules come into effect at the end of June without significant disruptions to our business. If needed, we have significant flexibility in our global operations footprint and we're developing contingency plans that we could implement. But again overall, we believe we're going to be able to meet the government's required standards when the rules become effective.\nMichael Sullivan\nThanks, Atif.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nToshiya Hari\nGood afternoon and thank you very much for taking the question. Gary, I was hoping you could give us an update on your business in China, both on the memory side as well as the logic and foundry side. One of your foundry customers just raised CapEx, I think it was yesterday, by $1 billion plus. I'm guessing the activity on the memory side continues to be pretty robust as well. But if you can give us an update on what you're seeing near term and what your expectations are for the second half that would be great. And then I've got a quick follow-up.\nDan Durn\nHi, Toshiya. I'll jump in on that question. So as we think about China, let's talk about where we ended 2019 and use that as a jumping-off point to talk about what we see incrementally into 2020 as it relates to domestic China spend.\nSo if we look back into 2019, the market sizing was about $6.5 billion. And a quarter ago, we set our expectation for 2020 was an incremental $2 billion to $3 billion of domestic China spend. Our expectation in 2020 is still $2 billion to $3 billion. But now, given the customer news overnight, we're probably at the high end of that range.\nAnd so a quarter ago as we think about the decomposition of that incremental spend, we said about one-third 200 millimeter trailing node foundry specialty logic spend, two-thirds of it was 300 millimeter. And as you decompose the 300 millimeter spend, it was roughly split 50-50 between foundry/logic and memory with balance among device types in memory.\nAnd as you think about us at the higher end of the range now, think about incrementally more spend in 300 millimeter trailing node foundry/logic. And I think that gives you an evolution of that spend profile of how the now $2.5 billion to $3 billion is spend toward the high end of that incremental range. That's the best insight we have at this point based on everything we see in the market and what we're talking with our customers about.\nToshiya Hari\nThat's helpful, Dan. Thank you. And then I think this one is for Gary. I just wanted to follow up on some of your market share comments. I think you said you gained seven percentage points of share in PVD. I was curious what you're seeing on the etch side in terms of market share. And you also spoke to your new product in optical inspection. If you can kind of speak to the differentiating factors for your tool with some of the competition and what your aspirations are over the next couple of years in terms of market share, that would be great. Thank you.\nGary Dickerson\nYes, so let me start with the PDC business overall, and then I\u2019ll answer the edge question. So our inspection measurement business is one of the segments where we have strongest momentum. We talked about the record last quarter we had in the first half of FY2020. And this is far above our previous best half year for the business. We've got strong \u2013 we will achieve strong double digit growth overall in 2020 and semi. And this segment will be one of the highest growth businesses for us this year, the inspection and measurement business. Relevant to the new optical inspection system, we have tremendous momentum with that system. We'll launch it later this year, very, very strong adoption in foundry/logic.\nI'd say the other thing that is positive relative to our PDC business is in e-beam. We have a strong leadership position we have also some new capabilities there, the highest resolution imaging technology in the industry and very strong initial adoption with new capability there with leading customers. So again, we're off to a great start in 2020 in PDC. And I would say the best position that we've ever had relative to that business.\nEtch to also, I think, as you know, we've had tremendous growth in the conductor etch business about 5x in terms of revenue growth between 2020 and 2018. And this is also where we have probably the best product, most successful product ever in the history of Applied Materials to SIM3. Relative to 2019, we gained about a half a point of overall Etch share. And in 2020, we also anticipate strong double digit growth in Etch. We have good momentum in memory, significant traction with all leading customers in foundry/logic where we haven't had very high shares, it\u2019s been very low in the past. We have really significant traction there. And a new product in packaging that also has strong momentum. So overall we anticipate strong growth in 2020 and we have good momentum with new capabilities and confidence that we're going to continue to grow Etch\u2019s share going forward.\nToshiya Hari\nThanks guys. See you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pitzer\nYes. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for, letting me ask the question. Dan I think I just want to try to better understand the impact of the supply constraints you are seeing from COVID. You talked about it impacting the April quarter by like $650 million and you said you will be able to make that up in both the fiscal third and fourth quarter. But then you also said in an answer to a question that you'd have some gross margin headwinds in the fiscal third quarter because you'd have 13 weeks of sort of these supply issues.\nAnd so I guess my question is supply also impacting what you can ship in the fiscal third quarter if so by how much? And when do you think we get to a situation where you guys can actually meet the demand that's on your books?\nDan Durn\nYeah, thanks John. Let me try to unpack it a little bit for you and give you a sense of how we think about it. Hopefully that gives you insight that addresses the question. And if I miss something, please let me know and I'll definitely follow-up. So as we think about where the supply chain is and how the supply chain gets healthier over time, I think, it's important to break it up into three components. And we'll deal with each of these three buckets in sequence.\nThe first, our suppliers back in business, raising their staffing levels and getting back to pre-COVID levels of output. That's sort of a set of issues bucket one. Bucket two, how quickly can they make up for lost volumes? And then the third bucket is, is the logistics channels and how they get healthier over time.\nAnd so as we think about the time sequence and overlay of each of those three vectors, all of our suppliers are back in the game, they're working back to hundred percent staffing levels and getting back to pre-COVID levels of output. I think exiting our fiscal Q3, I think, a good portion, a disproportionate share of that will be behind us.\nThat leaves then the second bucket, which is how quickly can you make up for lost volumes? I think that happens given the robust environment we see. I think that happens over our fiscal Q4 and our fiscal Q1. So exiting the calendar year, it should be a direct read through on true and market demand in terms of our business activity, based on what we can see today, that looks like the trajectory. \nThe third bucket, the logistics, this is something that's going to be a longer term issue to get back to normal. And the reason I say that is there's a correlation between the commercial airline industry and the logistics channels. What I mean is if we're not shipping a full system, full systems, they'll go on special freighter aircraft. A lot of what we do, short of a full system will ride in the belly of a commercial aircraft. We've had to pivot that to alternative freight and logistics channels. And the costs associated with that have risen and create a margin headwind. Given the correlation to the health of the commercial industry, I think, this one is with us for the foreseeable future. And we're likely to have those increased freight and logistics costs stick with us until we can see the degrees of freedom in commercial aviation begin to get much healthier and more active versus the levels today.\nSo if you hear my comments about that margin headwind being around for a while, I sort of disconnect that from the fundamental health of the supply chain. I think we're back, our suppliers are back to pre-COVID levels of output exiting the current fiscal quarter. I think the balance of the calendar year we make up for lost volumes, hard to predict at this point when the commercial aviation channels begin to free up to something similar to what we saw pre-COVID. Hopefully that shed some light on how we're seeing things John and answers your question.\nJohn Pitzer\nThat's really helpful. And then as my follow-up, Gary, there has been a lot of investor focus on the opportunities you might have in China and maybe some of the risks associated with that from just a geopolitical perspective. Over the weekend we kind of got a different flavor of that with some arguments about perhaps more domestic manufacturing of leading edge semiconductors, not only here in the U.S., but there were some articles out of Japan. I guess I'd be curious, I know it's early, I'd love to get your thoughts on this potential drive for more sovereign manufacturing of leading edge chips. And as you think about that opportunity, would this be sort of redundant capacity in your estimation, or would it be growth capacity, or how do you think that that plays out over the coming years?\nGary Dickerson\nYes, thanks for the question, John. So this has been discussed for a while. But the focus certainly has been increasing with the current geopolitical situation. I can't, of course, share any details of any discussions I've had with anyone on the topic, but for sure this is a good opportunity for the United States and also for Applied. And we'd be very supporting \u2013 supportive of making the concept a success. If we look at when our customers go into different geographic regions, it does create a good opportunity for us. If we look at some of our major customers, I'm not going to talk about anyone in specific, but it creates a really great service opportunity for us as they move into a different geographic location, where they don't have the same nucleus or critical mass of technical horsepower.\nSo as we've had discussions with some of the customers that are thinking about moving into different geographic locations, support of course is one of the key aspects of their decision making. And so again, I think, it could be a really good opportunity for Applied Materials. And certainly from a geopolitical standpoint, a good thing for the United States for this opportunity.\nJohn Pitzer\nThanks John.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.\nKrish Sankar\nYes hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on operating in such a tough environment with the results. So first question either for Dan, when I look at the second half you said that there's going to be $650 million that got impacted in April, that's going to flow through in the second half of this year. If you strip out the $650 million, is it fair to assume second half revenues would be lower than the first half of revenues? And then I have a follow-up.\nDan Durn\nYes, Krish just give me a second to pull up the model. Yes, I wouldn't necessarily say that's true. And here is why I go there. First we talked about supply chain, getting back to pre-COVID levels of output throughout our fiscal Q3. So that's an exit rate comment. And implicit in that exit rate comment is the fact that they're not able to supply true end market demand throughout Q3. And we exited Q3, as Gary talked about in his prepared comments, with record backlog in our semi-related business, SSG plus AGS and actually record orders in Q2 as well.\nSo demand continues to be strong and the supply chain will get healthier exiting Q3. And then make up volumes from unmet demand to date through Q3 \u2013 I'm sorry, fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1. So we think we exit the calendar year shipping to true end market demand. So there's a bit of a bleed over of this dynamic into the next fiscal year. And so I think given what we've seen from an order standpoint and what we're entering Q3 with from a backlog perspective, I still think we see strength in the back half of our year.\nIf we break that down by device type, what do we see? We see continued strength throughout the year in foundry, logic. We talked about broadening of our order book in foundry/logic, we talked about multiple customers, multiple nodes we talked about some softness as it relates to things like auto, and industrial, and consumer end markets and that's more trailing node geometries. What we're seeing on the leading edge continues to be strong.\nAs we think about memory, a quarter ago we talked about the second half of the year being the swing factor. And that construct still holds from a memory standpoint, calendar year Q4 is still beyond the horizon of visibility. And so we do think we're in a strong environment and we think the company performed pretty well in the back half of the year even without the 650 million that the \u2013 we were unable to meet in the most recent fiscal quarter.\nKrish Sankar\nGo it. That's pretty helpful Dan. And then just as a follow-up, thanks for the color on your view on the commerce department ruling. I\u2019m curious on the services side, how much of your revenue comes from China? And if you have a view things go negative with the commerce department ruling for you or for the U.S. semi-cap company, what happens to the service revenue especially in the foundry side when you have existing tools out there?\nDan Durn\nYes. So thanks Krish. Let me just try to walk through a little bit of a construct. As we think about the business we do in China today, there we do both semiconductor business and display business. So I'm going to walk you through a bit of a framework of how to think about it to get a sense of how much service business is done in China. So just bear with me as I walk you through this framework.\nSo we do both display and semiconductor business, as you know, in China. So if we take 2019, you add about 29% of our overall company revenue done in China. We've got a large display business, $1.6, almost $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2019. The vast, vast majority of that business goes into China. So if you extract that from the overall China business, that gives you a pretty good look at the size of the semi systems and service business that's done in China. If I then disaggregate it and take the service segment out of that revenue pool and you think about kind of the corporate average service to semi systems, it's kind of a 70-30 split give or take.\nAnd so I think that gives you a sense when you extract the display revenues, you get a clean look through on the semi-related business in China. And then you about it as a 70 30 split gives you a sense. But you also have to keep in mind that that service business and systems business service, both multinationals and the domestic industry. And the rough order of magnitude of how the systems business splits up across those two dimensions, think of it maybe 65% domestic, 35% multinational. That gives you a rough framework of how to think about the decomposition of the China business. And hopefully that helps give you a little insight into how to think about that business without being point specific because we don't disclose that level of detail.\nGary Dickerson\nThanks Krish.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nHarlan Sur\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the foundry/logic side the leading foundry supplier has steadily moved down the path of Moore's Law on the equipment industry has certainly benefited from their aggressive technology migration cadence. Now it looks like that your large logic customer is also getting back on track to executing to a two, two and a half year cadence on node migration, after about a three or four year pause and probably a lot of views.\nSo now that you have multiple large customers in foundry/logic moving at an aggressive cadence over the next few years, how are you guys thinking about the mix of WFE spend foundry/logic versus memory over the next few years?\nGary Dickerson\nYes, thanks Harlan. So as we take a look at what happened in 2019 and then talk about what we see in 2020 but then I also want to project forward. So just kind of breaking it down a little bit, we talked about a quarter ago WFE being about $51 billion, $52 billion in 2019. We think we see the market pretty well. Subsequent to our earnings call a quarter ago, VLSI came out and sized 2019 at $51.5 billion. So right in the middle of how we were thinking about it. So we feel good about that view and it's a good number around 2019. We think about how you decompose that WFE number in 2019 by device type. And it's roughly 60% foundry, 40% memory, balance across the two device types and memory.\nThat gives you a rough order of the structure of the market in 2019. And while I think it's premature today to size the market for a variety of reasons that we can go into premature to size the market in 2020 we think the rough order of split by device type looks and feels similar to what we saw in 2019 so again, another year of 60% foundry/logic, 40% memory with balance between device types.\nAs we look forward, we talk about the new playbook. We talk about the suite of innovation that this company is bringing to market, the ability to integrate those technologies, the ability to drive onboard sensors and metrologies to dial in process recipes faster. There\u2019s a clear enablement strategy by this company to drive our customers power, performance, area, cost and time roadmaps. We think we're incredibly well positioned to do that against the backdrop of rising capital intensity over time, with time being a really important element of this.\nWe have the opportunity to play a really valuable role with our customers in driving that time to market dimension across that new playbook. And that puts us in a really strong position competitively. And we think the dynamic of the position, the innovation, where the market is going in terms of time to market, as well as rising capital intensity, we feel good about where the spend profile and Foundry/logic is going over time. So while I can't be point specific going forward, I think, I gave you some insight in terms of how we, as a company, are thinking about this trend off of where we sit today.\nHarlan Sur\nYes, extremely helpful. Thanks for the insights there. And then within your framework for the fiscal second half of the year, from a revenue perspective, how should we think about the trajectory of OpEx for the remainder of the fiscal year from the Q2 levels?\nDan Durn\nSo if we go back a quarter, we said for the last three quarters of our fiscal year, we would, from a planning assumption standpoint, think about $820 million of OpEx per quarter. As you can see in the current environment, clearly, there're savings from a travel standpoint, but the company also did a good job from a discretionary spend perspective. And R&D as a percent of OpEx in the most recent quarter is almost 70%, 69.5%. The company is doing a really good job controlling discretionary spend and we are able to do better than that original guidance around $820 million.\nI think given where we sit today in an environment that's defined by a little bit higher operating expenses, I think, a good planning assumption for us is, is to keep the $820 million as the right way to think about it. This is a company that will always be disciplined around what we do and how we do it. There's no sacred cows and no entitlement to spend. We will be very disciplined around discretionary spend and make sure that we channel those resources to fuel for future growth. But $820 million is the right assumption in the back part of our fiscal year. There's an opportunity to do better. We certainly will.\nHarlan Sur\nThanks, Dan.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Your line is now open.\nPierre Ferragu\nHi. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's very refreshing to hear you talking about the rest of the year with, I would say, a good \u2013 a nice dose of optimism. It's nice to see that the value chain \u2013 seems to be well engaged. And I was just trying to think through what would be the downside risk against your current view. So if you're thinking 2020 could be in line with 2019. That's in the context of still a lot of uncertainty being out there.\nAnd to me it's a big uncertainty is end demand and the general micro economic environment. And so I was wondering in a world in which things do not recover in the second half and actually, the macro environment is very difficult, and in particular consumer demand for smartphones, for PCs, for consumer electronics get badly hit. How do you think it's going to affect investment plans of your clients? And maybe another way to put it is in the revenues you see between now and the end of your fiscal year, how much do you think is driven by like the technology train and it's going to happen, it has to go through? And how much could be actually adjusted down if the industry has to scale down significantly on capacity, on manufacturing volumes? Thank you.\nDan Durn\nOkay, Pierre let me just try to \u2013 there's a lot in there, let me try to hit these. So first I want to just maybe address the framing of the question. When we said profile in 2020, similar to 2019, that was kind of a percent split across device types. I think it's too early to be point specific on the aggregate dollar amount of WFE spend. But what we want to do though is communicate in an attempt to be helpful, communicate about what we see and hear from our customers and what we're see and hear in our business and then extrapolate that towards a view on a market.\nSo what do we see in our business? We see Q1 of our fiscal year our semi-related businesses, SSG and AGS, up 18% year-over-year. Q2 we saw strong demand, but we're actually supply chain limited. Despite that, we were up 13% year-over-year in those two businesses. So the first half of our fiscal year, we're up about 16% year-over-year in our semi-related business. We enter Q3, record backlog in those two businesses. And based on what we're seeing and hearing from customers, we're planning for Q3 to be up sequentially. And then we're expecting it to be up again in Q4. And our view for the fiscal year is strong double digit growth of our systems business.\nNow, as we think about WFE in the back half of the year, the best framing that I can give you, independent of what we see and hear from our customers because we feel good about our business. What we see and hear, I'm sorry, what we \u2013 the best way to frame the back half of WFE, I think, there's going to be two factors that influence WFE in the back half of the year. There's what the customers do and then there's what the supply chain does as it gets healthier. And we know and are aware of the economic, macroeconomic environment. We're aware of what's going on. We see pluses and minuses, cloud, data center, PC, comm infrastructure, are still showing signs of strength. It's offset by softness in things like auto, industrial, consumer, travel, leisure. So we do have that push and pull from a macro environment standpoint and we see those pluses and minuses playing out in the market.\nToo early for us to decide how that ultimately plays out. Then you have to overlay the comments we made on the supply chain. The combination of those two will influence the shape of WFE in the back half of the year. That said, we feel good about where we sit looking into our Q3 and our Q4.\nPierre Ferragu\nThanks Dan.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the\u2026\nDan Durn\nYes, operator if you don't mind, I just wanted to let you know that we have time for just one more question. Thank you.\nOperator\nNo problem. Last question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJoe Moore\nYes, thank you. I wonder just in terms of the way that you've characterized the coming quarter, you didn't give guidance, but then you gave fairly specific segment guidance. Can you just talk about the message we should be taking away from that? Is that just that there's the segment guidance, but there's uncertainty around it and why not just guide with a wider range if that's the case?\nGary Dickerson\nYes, thanks Joe. I wouldn't read anything into it other than if we were to go back three months and think about our Q1 earnings call, what we knew at the time was we had a hotspot in China, the rest of the globe was fine. Based on what we saw we de-risked our guide by $300 million and we talked about it being $150 million semi systems, a $100 million in display and $50 million in AGS. And against that backdrop, we executed really well in display and AGS. We fell short in semi systems. And then you ask yourself, why we fell short. There was a concurrent shelter in place order issued for six weeks of our quarter that impacted a material part of the supply chain. That was unknowable at the time we guided a quarter ago.\nAnd given the potential for other aspects of this COVID pandemic to spring up in unexpected places, we felt it was prudent to not guide but share in an attempt to be helpful, share what we're seeing in the business. And we tried to strike the right balance between openness and transparency and trying to be helpful without putting a number out there that there's things that could potentially happen we have no control of. We can't execute our way out of a complete shutdown of our supply chain. And nursing it back to health that impacted six weeks of our quarter. \nThat was an unknowable event at the time we guided. So it's nothing more than trying to strike the right balance between that transparency and prudent in an environment recognizing the elevated macro risk of where we sit today around the world.\nJoe Moore\nOkay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then in terms of the second half memory spending, I guess when I talk to your memory customers, they're \u2013 it's basically sounding like Q2 is pretty solid still, but most of them are conveying a fair amount of uncertainty as to the back half and talking about memory companies not being a leading indicator. And seem to be getting ready for a variety of scenarios. So as you think about that spending pattern, is enough of it technology spending that you feel like this is pretty solid kind of, regardless of the memory pricing environment, or is some of it, I guess \u2013 just what's any vulnerability to conditions worsening in the second half?\nDan Durn\nSo what I would say to that is, is we shared with you what we're seeing and hearing from customers today. I think we recognize that there's pluses and minuses at play in the market. We try to be open about what we're seeing on both sides of that ledger. And what I would say is, is we're just going to continue to be very vigilant at the business. We're going to be ready to respond quickly as the situation evolves. We'll continue to be transparent, and we will let you know what we see each quarter, but hard at this point to call it with precision exactly how that unfolds and profiles in the back part of the year. And so let's take it one quarter at a time and we'll share with you what we see along the way.\nJoe Moore\nGreat. Thank you so much.\nMichael Sullivan\nAll right, thanks Joe. Dan, anything you'd like to say before we close the call?\nDan Durn\nSure Mike. I'd like to share our best \u2013 I'd like to share our best wishes to everyone who has been affected by the COVID situation. I'd also like to sincerely thank our employees for adapting to a difficult environment and showing strong support for our customers. They've done a truly strong job and we appreciate it.\nOur company is privileged. It's privileged to pay a big role in enabling the work-from-home and the learn-from-home and enabling those technologies that the world needs right now. We're mindful of the macroeconomic risks, but our business is broader, more resilient than it has in the past. And we continue to see strength throughout the second half of our fiscal year. We will stay close to the investors throughout this situation.\nGary and I, we\u2019re going to be at the Bernstein conference in a couple of weeks. I'm going to attend events hosted by Needham, and Cowen and BofA. So we hope to see many of you soon. Stay safe. Be healthy. Mike, let's close the call.\nMichael Sullivan\nOkay, thanks Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of our call is going to be available on the website by 5:00 P.M. Pacific Time. And we would like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Baker Hughes First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions).\nI will now turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Flaharty, Director of Investor Relations. Sir you may proceed.\nGary Flaharty\nThank you Dennis and good morning everyone, welcome you to the Baker Hughes first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Here with me this morning are Peter Ragauss, Baker Hughes\u2019 Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Craighead, Senior Vice President and Chief Operation Officer, and Chad Deaton, Baker Hughes\u2019 Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chairman.\nFollowing management\u2019s comments this morning we will open the lines for your questions. Reconciliation of operating profits and any non-GAAP measures to GAAP results for historic periods can be found on our website at www.BakerHughes.com in the Investor Relations section under financial information.\nI also want to caution you that any Company outlooks discussed this morning are subject to various risk factors. We will try to highlight these risk factors as we make these forward looking statements. However, the format of the call does prevent a more thorough discussion of the risk factors. For a full discussion, please refer to our annual report 10-K, 10-Q, and in particular the forward looking disclosure in this morning\u2019s news release.\nWith that, I will conclude our discussion of the administrative details and turn the call over to Peter Ragauss.\nPeter Ragauss\nThanks Gary and good morning. Today we reported net income on a US GAAP basis of $195 million or $ $0.63 per share. This compares to $1.27 per share a year ago and $1.41 per share for Q4 2008. Q1 revenue was $2.67 billion flat with the first quarter of 2008 and down $518 million or 16% last quarter.\nNorth American revenue was $1.1 billion in the first quarter down 8% compared to the first quarter of 2008 and down 23% compared to Q4. Total North American revenue of $1.6 billion was up 6% year on year but down 11% sequentially. Our oil field operating margin in Q1 was 14%. This compares to 23% in the year ago quarter and 22% in Q4.\nSeverance cost in the first quarter was $54 million. In addition we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to $29 million. Excluding the impact of these 2 charges which are unique to the quarter our Q1 oil field operating margin would have been 17%.\nOverall our performance in the first quarter was consistent with the severity of the drop in drilling activity in North America. It is hard to believe today that the US recount still averaged 1,344 rigs in Q1. US recount declined at 682 rigs from 1721 at the beginning of the quarter to 1039 rigs at quarter end. A drop of nearly 40% and it stands at 955 as of last Friday. The decline in recount was more rapid and more severe than we saw in the last four down cycles.\nTurning to the performance of our two segments; drilling and evaluation revenue was $1.3 billion in Q1 down 6% compared to the year ago quarter and down 17% sequentially. The drilling and evaluation segments operating margin was 12% in Q1 down from 25% in the year ago quarter and down from 21% in the prior quarter. Adjusting for severance and the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts, the operating margin in any segment was 15%.\nRevenue for our completion of production segment was 1.4 billion up 7% from the year ago quarter but down 15% sequentially margins in our completion of production segments held up better in Q than our drilling and evaluation product lines that are highly correlated with the recount. \nC&P operating margin in Q1 was 17% down from 21% in the first quarter of 2008 down from 23 % in the prior quarter. Adjusting for severance and the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts, the operating margin for our C&P segments was 19%.\nTo help you evaluate our earnings per share in the first quarter I will review you through the significant items that bridged the sequential and year ago quarters to the first quarter EPS and $0.63.\nIn Q4 2008 our US GAAP net income per share was $1.41. From this $1.41 add $0.08 for the impairment of auction rate securities in Q4 2008. Subtract $0.08 for the impact of higher share count auction rate and higher tax rate compared to Q4, subtract $0.04 as a result of higher corporate expense and subtract $0.01 for higher net interest expense both compared to Q4. Subtract $0.12 for severance and $0.04 increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts. Subtract $0.36 for decreased profits in North America and subtract $0.21 for decreased profits outside of North America, primarily related to the seasonal decline in large export orders from Q4 to Q1 and the impact of the unfavorable changes in exchange rate. This gets to the $0.63 we are reporting for the first quarter.\nNow bridging from the year ago quarter, from our US GAAP net income per share of $1.27 we reported in the first quarter of 2008, subtract $0.06 for the gain on sale of the product line in Q1 2008. Subtract $0.06 to account for the impact of higher interest expense. Subtract $0.12 for severance and subtract $0.06 for increasing our allowance for doubtful account. Subtract $0.33 for decrease in profits in North America and subtract $0.01 for decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.63 we are recording for the first quarter. \nNow, turning to the balance sheet, total debt decreased $520 million in the quarter to $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we repaid $525 million in maturities from proceeds of the $1.5 billion of a long-term debt we issued in October of last year. We have no maturities on long-term debt until November 2013. At quarter end, our long-term debt to cap ratio was 20% and our net debt was $634 million.\nWe currently have $1 billion in un-drawn committed credit facilities comprised of $500 million facility which is accessible through 2012 and $500 on 364 day facility which was successfully rolled over in March and is accessible through March 2010. At the end of the first quarter, we also had cash in short-term investments of $1.2 billion. This totals $2.2 billion in available liquidity.\nMoving on to guidance, 2009 capital expenditures are expected to remain in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and our CapEx budgets reflects continued investment in the infrastructure particularly in the international markets as well as some capital for new rental tools and incremental capacity for a completion on production segment product lines.\nOur tax rate for 2009 is expected to be between 31% or 32% and finally, we still anticipate being cash flow positive in 2009.\nI will now turn the call over to Martin who will highlight our geographic results, Martin.\nMartin Craighead\nThanks, Peter. I will begin with North America which had a very challenging quarter particularly in the latter half given the decline in land rig activity. Peter spoke to the declines in the U.S. rig count. Canada did not fair any better. In Q1, the Canadian rig count averaged 329 rigs (the lowest since 1995). Overall, in Q1, the total North American rig count was down 27% year on year.  The majority of the reductions occurred on land. We expect further declines in North American Land Activity in Q2. The offshore rig count was down only 2% compared to the year ago quarter.\nGoing forward, we expect weakness in the shelf to be offset by strengthening deep water activity as we expect six additional deep water rigs will be in the gulf by yearend.\nUnited States revenues were down 5% year on year compared to a rig count that was down 24%. Our results highlight the differential performance of our completion in production segment which was up 13% year on year compared to our drilling and evaluation segment which was down 23% in line with the rig count.\nCompared to the prior quarter, United States revenues decreased 24%. Canadian revenue was down 19% year on year compared to a 36% decrease in rig activity and decreased 16% sequentially compared to a 19% decline on rig count. A weaker Canadian dollar was also a contributing factor for the revenue decline.\nSelf-reductions and activity and lower pricing in the quarter had a detrimental impact on profitability. Early in the quarter, we took steps to address market conditions through closure and/or consolidation of over a dozen facilities as well as a reduction in our workforce. Related severance charges were $34 million. The reduction in employee base is expected to deliver annual savings of $175 million in North America and we expect to hit that run rate in the third and fourth quarters. We will take other actions to appropriately size our North American operations to the market as it becomes necessary.\nAs the full benefit of these actions could not be realized in the quarter, our North American operating profit margin declines to 12% in Q1. This compares to 27% in the first quarter of 2008 and 23% in the prior quarter. Adjusting for severance and the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts, the operating margin was 16% in Q1.\nNorth America remains an area of substantial strength for Baker Hughes. We have a very competitive suite of technologies which positions us well for continue of activity in the unconventional GAAP\u2019s place and in the deep water Gulf of Mexico. Furthermore, these technologies and our overall capabilities have afforded us a very strong market position and while we will work to defend price, it will not be at the expense of share.\nTurning to our Latin America region, the story in Latin America in Q1 was substantially one of strong and increasing activities in Brazil and Mexico. Elsewhere in the region, many operators reduced operating budgets and activity levels as lower commodity prices negatively impacting cash flow. We see this trend continuing throughout 2009. Latin American revenues in Q1 were up 23% year on year against the rig account that was substantially flat compared to the first quarter of 2008. The largest revenue increases occurred in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador.\nYear on year, revenue growth in Brazil was driven by our directional drilling and fluid\u2019s product lines and revenue growth in Mexico was lead by our completions product line. In Colombia, year over year growth was lead by the directional drilling and artificial lift product lines. Latin American revenue was down 15% compared to the prior quarter. The sequential decline reflects unexpected seasonal reduction in export orders. Sequential revenue decreases were greatest in Colombia, Venezuela, and Argentina where low oil prices have continued to depress activity levels.\nThe operating profit margin in Latin America for the first quarter was 9% down from 19% in Q1 2008 and down from 21% in the prior quarter. Adjusting for severance and the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts, the operating margin was 15% in Q1.\nI would like to bring to your attention a few operational highlights. At the end of March, we were drilling on two rigs on the Alma Marine Project in Mexico. The contract we have highlighted to you in previous calls. We did not recognize any revenue associated with this project in the first quarter as project milestones were achieved days after quarter end and the revenues will be recognized in Q2. However, we did have staffing and mobilization cost in Q1. The project will be a positive contributor to our Mexico operations beginning in the second quarter and we expect to be operating on four rigs by the end of the second quarter.\nBefore leaving Latin America, I am very happy to report that in addition to our sizable position with Petrogas in Brazil. In Q1, we were awarded a four-year, $170 million contract from a major international oil company furthering our ability to build economies of scale and scope in one of the world\u2019s leading services market. This contract award includes directional drilling, logging well drilling, upper completions and artificial lift systems.\nTurning to the Middle East Asia Pacific Region, Middle East revenues increased year over year with higher activity in the Emirates, Egypt, Oman, offset by lower revenues from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The sequential decline was principally due to lower activity in Saudi Arabia consistent with Saudi Aramco\u2019s plans to reduce overall activity.\nWhile Saudi Aramco is reducing activity, they remain committed to using leading technologies to access difficult to develop reservoirs. Our Mag Track Nuclear Magnetic Resonance LWD tool continues to deliver strong performance as part of our directional drilling suite. The 4-entry quarter inch Mag Track tool remains the only tool of its size capable of collecting the valuable NMR data while drilling their giants beneath a reservoir enabling Aramco to properly identify the oil/tar contact.\nOur notable successes with Aramco extended the global sides and its sides as well where our sides\u2019 explorer services demonstrated our ability to deploy 100 levels well bore receiver string to provide a high resolution down hall seismic data. With this technology, our customers can now efficiently shoot high volume shock patterns which are spirals and multiple walkway lines with a volume and resolution required to make critical field development decisions.\nIn Asia Pacific, year on year revenue increases were led by Indonesia, Brunei, and India. Sequentially, Asia Pacific revenue decreased with the largest decreases coming from Indonesia and Australia. Customers in the region continue to leverage technology as well to lower overall operating cost. During the quarter, we were awarded a three-year contract for the intelligent well system in Malaysia and in China we were awarded the completions contract from an NOC operating in the Bohai Bay.\nDuring the quarter, we completed the mobilization of six offshore wireline skid units and two trucks in support of a recent contract award with ONGC. Logging operation started in early January and since that time, we have provided a full range of open hole and case hole service. The operating profit margin was 14% in Q1 2009 compared to 20% in Q1 2008 and 23% in Q4 2008. Adjusting for severance and the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts, the operating margin was 15% in Q1.\nWe continue to see the Middle East Asia Pacific Region as an area of great opportunity for Baker Hughes and as just highlighted we are making progress penetrating key markets. Nevertheless, I am disappointed with the pace in revenue and margin growth. In the next few weeks, we will announce additions to our management team that will help us address these markets.\nTurning to Europe, Africa, Russia, and the Caspian, revenue for the region was up 2% year on year but down 8% sequentially. In addition to significant activity declines in some areas, results were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange movement particularly in the United Kingdom, Norway, and Russia.\nIn Q1, European activity was impacted by lower oil prices and credit availability challenges which have been particularly is due to independent operators in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. Revenue in Europe declined year on year and sequentially strong year on year growth and directional drilling in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea was more than offset by weaker sales in the United Kingdom. \nIn Russia and the Caspian, declines in activity were significant. Low oil prices, weakness of the ruble and unfavorable tax structure as well liquidity issues and a lack of financing alternatives continued to be an issue for many operators.\nRevenue for Russia and the Caspian decreased year on year contributing to the decline of the lower sales and the completion of special chemicals product lines in Russia and lower wireline activity and completion sales in the Caspian. Revenue decrease sequentially on lower activity in the directional drilling, completions, drill bit and artificial product lines. \nIn Africa, revenue was up year over year lead by directional drilling, completions and artificial lift activity in Libya and by completions activity in Nigeria. Revenue declines sequentially as activity of independent operators was impacted by funding issues and expiration program slowed.\nLooking forward, we see steady expansion in Libya in the North African market and we are continuing our focus on deep water opportunities in West Africa. During the quarter, we were awarded a contract for a significant portion of deep water services for an IOC in Nigeria. Products and services to be provided include directional drilling, logging while drilling, wireline services, and completion.\nOperating profit in the region was essentially unchanged \u2013 19% Q1 2009 compared to 20% in Q1 2008 and 20% in Q4 2008. Adjusting for severance and the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts, the operating margin was 22% in Q1. Overall, Q1 was an outstanding for that region.\nI will now turn the call over to Chad.\nChadwick Deaton\nOkay. Thanks, Martin. Looking at the North American Market, we are clearly in one of the most challenging markets that we have faced in a very long time. The rig count in the United States continues to fall and as of last week, we were down 53% from the September peak and given the magnitude of the decline in the United States gas rig count it does appear, we were actually seeing in the beginning of possibly a production response. However, there are several factors that may inhibit a return to the 1,600 plus or minus gas directed rig count that we enjoyed in the United States only a few months ago.\nFirst, application of advance technologies in shale gas place has led to significant increases in production. As a result, the industry may be able to sustain gas production with far less rigs. Second, global LNG liquefaction capacity is expected to increase around $29 billion cubic feet per day in 2008 to around $37 billion cubic feet per day by 2010. With decline in demand in the Pacific Basin and minimal storage capacity in the international market, LNG shipments to the United States are probably going to increase and with a weakened global economy, we believe there is ample gas supply to keep North American activities suppressed for several quarters.\nThe timing and level of any recovered depends on several factors including weather, economic activity and related demand, the impact of any new taxes on energy demand and energy companies and the timing and degree of the supply response, we expect to see and reduced joint activity.\nIn Canada, the breakup started about two weeks ago and we believe the second quarter breakup will be quite severe. Last week, the Canadian rig count stood at 65 rigs, 23 rigs below last year\u2019s lowest rig count. Canadian operators are facing the same challenge as the United States operators. As such, we expect activities to remain weak after the breakup.\nOur North American revenue performance over the last several quarters has led our peer group. Clearly, North America is the key area for us and we continue to believe that long term, this market will return to a more stable business. Perhaps, fewer rigs, the more technical and complex products and services will be utilized by those rigs as our clients view more conflicts horizontal and even multi-lateral wells. As witnessed in other parts of the world, we see increase revenue for rig as operators require higher end products and services in order to draw more technically challenging horizontal wells.\nIn the mean time, we have taken steps to right size on North American operations. We have reduced headcount and have closed in our consolidated several facilities. We had assigned personnel to international operations were possible. We expect further deterioration and activity in price but over the next several quarters, the service industry will adjust to market condition. Operating cost will be reduced and profitability levels will improved as cost reduction aspects are realized, efforts are realized.\nThe full benefit of our cost reductions will not be realized until the second half of the year, we also expect pricing pressure will continue on lower volumes in North America. We expect activity to average 950 rigs in quarter 2. If our forecast is correct, the sequential drop in activity from quarter 1 to quarter 2 will exceed the drop in activity we saw from quarter 4 to quarter1. Therefore, we believe that the consensus estimates for our second quarter are likely too high.\nLooking internationally, it is clear that $50 oil is not sufficient to support some of the projects with marginal economics today. The outlook for the world economy in oil demand remains uncertain. If we see oil prices recover to the $70 range, we will see many projects move ahead. If oil continues to trade near the $50 range, we will continue to see a slow decline in the international activity.\nActivity in United Kingdom continues to be weak, offset by Norway. In Saudi Arabia, rig counts are declining in response to lower oil prices. Activity in Russia and the Caspian has declined significantly but we believe that they are maybe reaching a bottom. We see West Africa and North Africa as areas of strength and Latin America provides the most opportunity in the near term as Brazil and Mexico move forward with large development projects.\nWe have made significant investments in the international markets over the last several quarters and have been successful in winning several large contracts. We also have successfully implemented numerous process and procedures to make sure that we operate within the guidelines of the FCPA and other government regulations. This past Sunday, marked the expiration of our deferred prosecution agreement. The expiration of this agreement is a testament to the success that we have had and established in the world-class compliance organization. Now, this does not signal a change in how we will conduct our business around the world. We will continue to operate in a transparent and compliant fashion to everything we do but it does represent a significant industry leading achievement.\nDuring these last two quarters, we took decisive actions on several fronts that we feel will enable us to come out of this down turn as a much stronger company. We have implemented headcount reductions that will deliver over $250 million in annual saving. We have taken actions to achieve efficiency in our shared services organization. They are expected to contribute annual savings and additional $50 million in 2010.\nWe have closed in consolidated facilities and continue to evaluate options for further consolidation. We strengthened our balance sheet providing the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities during this down turn as they arise.\nWe recruited and placed key executives in several important functions including a Vice-President of Supply Chain to drive the efficiencies through the organization which are expected to resolve additional cost reduction opportunities of over $300 million. We hired the Chief Information Officer to manage the efficient implementation of IT throughout the organization and the Vice-President reliability test was building out our quality management initiatives and reducing our client\u2019s non-predicted time and we are moving forward with our geographical organization which will enhance our ability to quickly and efficiently respond to our customers delivering technical solutions, and value for multiple product line.\nThrough all of this, we will maintain our investment in technology and development and our focus on execution. We had significant deep water contract wins in the quarter in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, and West Africa and we are having success in penetrating eastern hemisphere markets that we have targeted as demonstrated by a recent mobilization in six wireline units into the Indian market.\nWe remain confident at the lower levels of investment accelerating decline rates and an economic rebound will drive our customers and to make the significant investments required to meet the world\u2019s energy needs. This will, in turn, drive demand for products, technologies and services.\nGary, let us open it up for some questions.\nGary Flaharty\nAll right. Thank you, Chad. At this point, I\u2019ll ask Dennis to open the lines for your questions. To give everyone a fair chance to ask a question we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and a related follow up question. Dennis, could we have the first question please.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Crandell \u2013 Barclays Capital\n\nJames Crandell \u2013 Barclays Capital\nMartin, could you address the performance of this NMR sensor in Melissa\u2019s field. What is it about as it makes it better than the others? I know you displaced your competitor there and does it have, are the benefits such that this could be true in other regions as well?\nMartin Craighead\nWell, Jim, yes, let me clarify, when we say we displaced the competitor, there is no other offering (that is to my knowledge). No other competitive offering so it is hard to displace somebody. We are running in the bottom assembly of our competitor. They are still doing the drilling but it certainly is a significant piece of information for Aramco. It is very unusual to have somebody else\u2019s instrument in a bottom hole assembly. The issues there (as you are probably aware) is really viscosity identification as the oil stick above a tar mat. If they penetrate the tar mat, then basically they lose the well.\nThe benefit of the Mag Track for Baker Hughes is first, it is the only one that is about 3.25 in size which is what they need to drill the standard reach. Secondly, it has a very good vibration medication characteristic which is important obviously in a drilling environment. So, we get very good with (what is called) T2 measurements and we get very good resolution on being able to determine the viscosity of the oil. It is a big technical success for us. We are proud of it.\nSecond part of your question, we are running it in Brazil, both in the Santos Basin as well as in the Sub Salt on those carbons down there so it has been a big success for us.\nJames Crandell \u2013 Barclays Capital\nMartin, what was the rough size of the Nigerian contract that you won?\nMartin Craighead\nI am sorry, I missed that.\nJames Crandell \u2013 Barclays Capital\nWhat was the size roughly of the Nigerian contract that you won?\nMartin Craighead\nThat was $500 million.\n\nJames Crandell \u2013 Barclays Capital\nOver what time period, Chad? \nChadwick Deaton\nIt is over a 4-year period.\nJames Crandell \u2013 Barclays Capital\nOkay, and my, this related follow up is, Chad would you expect to be a competitor on the Iraqi contracts that may start here before year-end?\nChadwick Deaton\nWe will be a competitor. Jim, we have been selling product in Iraq for the last couple of 3 years and what we see again is selling in 2009 percentage-wise, it gets you very excited. Absolute dollar-wise is not big yet, but the area that we have been quite active in Iraq for the last couple of years has been on the reservoir evaluation side working with the Iraq international oil companies to identify these field which also gives them some size and understanding as a reservoir size of this field. So, yes we have opened our office there. We have had our teams in there quite actively for the last 6 to 8 months and we are participating in terms of tenders and looking at projects.\nOperator\nYour next questions come from Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International\nBill Herbert - Simmons & Company International\nChad, if you could add just, Chad and Martin, add a little bit more texture if you will with regard to the sequential margin performance in your non-North American regions, Europe, Africa, Russia very strong and looks to be up quarter on quarter ,Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Latin America even adjusting for the severance and non-cash charges in the quarter quite a bit lower quarter on quarter. Why were the margins so much lower in Latin America and the Middle East? And why were they or they so strong in the Europe-Africa-Russia Region?\nChadwick Deaton\nYou hit it right on the head and I think Martin said it. EARC, Europe/Africa had a very, very strong quarter. The reasons for that is Norway strength offset what we saw is some weakness in the UK in terms of activity although the guys did a pretty good job getting cost in line the first quarter in the UK in trying to offset some of that margin hit there. Africa was very strong force and North Africa, Libya, Algeria. In fact, they had some of the better quarters. I think Nigeria had its best quarter in quite some time.\nMartin Craighead\nLatin America I think we can explain a lot of it from the Mexico start up and Brazil start up cost on drilling fluids. We are still moving through those and as Martin said we did not recognize revenue in Mexico on the two rigs we are on and we did not reach the milestones effort, case in point but we did have the cost associated beyond those two rigs, So think you will see Latin America bounce back on the margin side and be more representatives or what is going on in the market.\nChadwick Deaton\nMartin hit it on the head there. We were not happy with what the response we are getting out of MEAP and so we are making some changes there and we did  think that it is a near of great importance for us I think I said on the last call or the call before that as a Company we have not focused on  Asia Pacific and MEAP as much as the other 3 regions and historically. So again we think that this has got great opportunity and you also saw Saudi which is a real driver for us in the MEAP region being down in line with the activity down  on rigs. So, that also weakened us in MEAP a little bit the quarter.\nBill Herbert - Simmons & Company International\nOkay so broadly speaking, I think you answered the question with regards to Latin America but broadly speaking in the non-North American realm as the year unfolds and assuming that drilling activity overall does not do a whole lot up or down and then you continue to witness sort of inevitable pricing pressure from IOCs what do you think is a reasonable outlook for margins as it unfolds in the non west American arena for 2009? \nMartin Craighead\nI think Latin America will improve towards the end of the year as we get our cost we talked about that one I think EARC is going to be under some additional pricing pressure so I think we probably had our strongest quarter in EARC in the first quarter. I think west Africa will hold this on but Europe itself will be under a little more pressure and I think Russia towards the end of the year could get a little better than what we saw in the first quarter and will see on the second quarter.\nAs I said in my comments, the Russia area seems to be [baddening] and it could get a little bit better by the end of the year. Now MEAP we think still going to be some struggling in Q2 and Q3 on some pricing issues and other things.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Pickering with the Tudor Pickering & Co. Sec.\nDan Pickering - Tudor Pickering & Co. Sec\nChad, you talked a little bit about the second quarter estimates it is being too high. I appreciate the caller, obviously we are going to push for some specificity. I would assume that 3% or 4% too high is not a meaningful number and you would not talk about it so we got to think about this is 10% or more type of kind of too high estimates out there is that a fair way to think about how you are guiding?\nChadwick Deaton\nWell, let me put it this way, last quarter I think consensus estimates for about $0.99 . We made the statements that consensus is too high and it came down to $0.75, $0.76. This time we said based on what we see and rig count dropping consensus is likely too high. So from that you have got to run your numbers.\nDan Pickering - Tudor Pickering & Co. Sec\nOkay. All right, we\u2019ll [grind] a way on that and then generally as you look at North America and the profitability there, did we see any meaningful price impact hitting in the first quarter, will that be more significant as we moved through the year? Did we see the full brunt of the price impacts in the first quarter? It is basically the same question that Bill asked on the international side but just take it to North America and where do you think we bottom margins there?\nChadwick Deaton\nI think North America started to see some price. January still wasn\u2019t a bad month but by the time we hit March it was clearly, as rig count goes down so was the pricing. There were a lot of discussion and renegotiations in the first quarter that will now probably be hitting us full in the second quarter. So I think the real pricing pressure is hitting starting from March, April, and May and will be with us through Q2, Q3. We don\u2019t really see rate count bottoming until end of Q2, Q3 most likely and it was still as I said in the call it is going to be down percentage wise more on Q1 to Q2 than it was from Q4 to Q1 price. So I think pricing is going to continue to spiral down to match that.\nDan Pickering - Tudor Pickering & Co. Sec\nSo do you think margins can hold double digits Chad or is that kind of did not still go over on your buggy?\nChadwick Deaton\nIt could be a challenge in North America to do that.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.\nKurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets\nHey, just along those lines Chad as might as well continue that questioning this time on the international front. So your peers have pretty said something along the lines of 300, 500 basis point increments in North America. As we move into the second quarter and the stabilization from that point forward. And then, the peer group has also suggested something along the line for the couple of the 300 basis point [decrement] on the international markets. Is there something in your product mix or some in your recent contract awards that would put you in a better position that your peers or do you think it is too much going on that you are not going to be able to dodge it?\nChadwick Deaton\nI think we are more in the area of what our peers I guess were saying, I don\u2019t think internationally is going to be as bad as domestically just simply because of the recount, new client, Kurt but most of these international projects are a lot larger there than what they used to be. They tend to be [blub] bundle services, bigger packages Martin talked about the Brazil win, we talked about the West Africa win, those were several product lines in there but our clients have been out talking to all of us, trying to get pricing down and everybody is negotiating this packages rather than just having them retendered. So I don\u2019t disagree with what their numbers are saying.\nKurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets\nI know historically during this periods of time your service company is definitely making effort to sell the value proposition clearly that\u2019s getting much more, more difficult. Can you just give us some sense on what kind of value add you are providing to your customers and then whether or not you\u2019re able to kind of mitigate the pricing pressure?\nChadwick Deaton\nWell, let\u2019s take the example, Kurt, off shore, deep water that\u2019s under a lot less pricing pressure. There is just a handful of competitors on those rigs. They are long-term contracts. Much of that work is already been awarded even the new rigs coming out, we know what we won on that. That\u2019s not going to come under a lot of pricing pressure, just simply because the clients with the kind of spread cost even if they can\u2019t get rig cost rates down they still have significant exposure there to not predict the time and failure. Land, internationally, that\u2019s where the pressure tends to be higher in terms of discounting, off shore again, deep water which is a significant part of our international market. So that part should hold up a little better than when you just get in to the land type operation in Russia etcetera clearly we are seeing a lot of pricing pressure in those particular areas.\nKurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets\nOkay, and then just one other house keeping item if I may, in the press release you guys reference specifically margin impact in North America, and in Latin America as related to severance and then the allowance for doubtful account and then Martin\u2019s commentary, he referenced the severance and doubtful accounts in the number of different regions. Can you guys give us that mix or is that better of off line?\nPeter Ragauss \nThis is Peter. We have taken, unfortunately we had to take severance charges in all regions around the globe. We have also increased our allowance for doubtful accounts in all regions around the globe. We have given you the margins, the adjusted margins for clarity. Why don\u2019t I just repeat the adjusted margins to make sure you get it. So oil field 17%, D&E 15%, C&P 19%, North America 16%, Latin America 15%, EARC 22%, MEAP 15%, then total ROW of 19%.\nSo you can take those percentages multiply the times the revenues etcetera and figure out the adjustments. What we were not prepared to do is talk about specific provisions and specific countries with specific customers.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Robin Shoemaker - Citi Group.\nRobin Shoemaker \u2013 Citi Group\nIt struck me that your severance charge in total was on the high side just compared to, what some of your other larger competitors reported and I\u2019m just wondering if you decided to be a little more out in front on this issue. We heard some other companies indicated that there was another big round of belt tightening coming in the current quarter. What is likely to happen in terms of your further work force reductions going forward and what possible explanation is there for the fairly large size of the charge you took in the first quarter?\nChadwick Deaton\nYes I think your right Robin. We tended to want to get this out of the way in the first quarter. If we have additional cuts going forward it is going to depend on what activity happens. We were trying to look at what we think is going to happen over the next couple of quarters and respond to that now. I think one of our competitors took a frigate cut in Q4, took some charges. I think some of our other competitor are probably doing a little in Q1 will do more in Q2. But we have identified and notified the people in all of the four regions and we are just moving forward going ahead. Some of those people are obviously in Europe and some other areas remain on the payroll in Q2 so we will have a little bit of overlap on that. That\u2019s why in Martins comments we said we wouldn\u2019t see the benefit of these cut really until Q3 and Q4 but I think we will be a little more pro active especially in North America to get the cost in line, because as we said we think this is going to last quite a few quarters.\nRobin Shoemaker \u2013 Citi Group\nOk understood. My follow up is related to the IPM bundled services issue. Where we see you winning some projects and also in the high-tech arena but what about some of the large IPM bundled services projects that are a little more low tech, well construction type of projects, but fairly sizeable. We saw you have been, I think in the first quarter on a couple of those projects in Mexico. What is your view on the IPM arena and where you fit in with that?\nChadwick Deaton\nWhat we do like high-end high-tech bundled type projects more than just necessarily chasing rigs and above a drilling contractor type model, but if look at Mexico for example we have won a project for offshore which tends to be more of a high-tech approach to things but we have also gone after some land operation. We are right now the leading contender on the most recent Chicontepec project. It\u2019s a little smaller than the previous ones but when the beds were opened we were the winners so they are going thru the qualification process now. Where the market dictates it, we will participate. We are not necessarily going to be the leader to buy rigs and get out there and try to lead in that area, but Mexico is clearly a market were it is happening, Russia, we are managing four in Russia where we have project. Algeria we have an ITM type project in Algeria on a 6 rigs. So where the market is leaning in that direction, we will participate.\nRobin Shoemaker - Citi Group\nOk. And if you do get conformation of the award on Chicontepec, when would that project likely begin?\nChadwick Deaton\n\nI believe it is the third quarter, end of the third quarter.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from a line of Goeff Kieburtz \u2013Weeden & Company\n\nGoeff Kieburtz \u2013Weeden & Company\nLet me just take upon the Chicontepec comment, I have not honestly looked at that details of the bidding but in winning that contract, did you have to go back and re-think the way you bid prior to Chicontepec work?\nChadwick Deaton\nYes. I think what helped us in getting some of the bidding on this contract the way did was because of our exposure now on the offshore market down there and we built up some mask.\nGoeff Kiebutrtz \u2013Weeden & Company\nOk. So it is really changed circumstances allowed you to approach in a different manner?\nChadwick Deaton\nYes. I would say that is a fair comment.\nGoeff Kiebutrtz \u2013Weeden & Company\nAnd do you see that then being, Chicontepec, a project that will expand your exposure to over the next couple of years?\nChadwick Deaton\nYes Geoff there are several more of this ATG projects I think there is another five or six or seven to be tendered in the next coupled of years and with PAMEX going to grow some fifteen thousand wells in the area, it is going to be an active market. So again  that\u2019s been able to get in on the offshore and some of the little higher end, high technical side of the business. We feel that we got some of our cost covered and we can do a little more aggressive going after the Chicontepec or ATG projects.\nGoeff Kiebutrtz \u2013Weeden & Company\nAnd what would you expect that to do to your Latin American margins over that time period?\nChadwick Deaton\n \nI think initially when you first start it may have a little effect for a quarter or two but as we seen in other competitors as you become more efficient, you should be able to bring your margins back.\nGoeff Kiebutrtz \u2013Weeden & Company\nGreat! If I could just ask a housekeeping question? I know what Peter said about giving us the adjusted margins but would you mind giving us the combined doubtful account and severance charges for D&E and C&P in dollar terms?\nChadwick Deaton\n \nYes we can do that. Probably, Gary will calculate those numbers and get them to you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from a line of Micheal LaMotte with J.P Morgan\nMicheal LaMotte - J.P. Morgan\nChad if I could follow up on your comment about recount recovery in the U.S\nAnd in particular the focus within the shales on more of the technical service, I have to ask a question, does it alter your thinking or willingness or appetite to act as a consolidator in the North American market at all?\nChadwick Deaton\nAre you talking about our type of services?\nMicheal LaMotte - J.P. Morgan\nWell your type of services or even an extension of plug and play types of businesses that you are on in now?\nChadwick Deaton\n \nIt does not make much sense for us to be a consolidator of our type of services and I think especially when I start looking at the shale place and things because its hard to match technology or systems that you have by trying to acquire somebody else. I think there will be consolidations and without a doubt. I just think that we are in a cycle where we see so much in the past where a lot of capacities have been added and needs to be taken out. We will be opportunistic if something comes up that we think its fit. Our product lines or fills the gap for us. Evaluations are clearly going to be coming down then will take a look at that. But for the most part, our acquisitions and things we were looking for will tend to be more in a technical end, the reservoir end, gaps that we may have but not necessarily just to be a consolidator.\nMicheal LaMotte - J.P. Morgan\nOk. That is helpful color thank you. And then if I could follow up just for a product or service lines stand point on Centrilift in general we would think of more production oriented business with tend to hold up in a lower rig count environment. But historically Russian, Valenzuela has been big market for ESP. Can you just talk about that business and what the expectation are for this year and how is it handling the cyclical downturn? \n\nChadwick Deaton\n \nCentrilift is typically half cycles on this for the past years and this is not different usually has a weaker Q1 than they do in Q4, a lot of that is due to sales of equipment. We do two things in Centrilift , we lease ESPs and we sell ESPs depending on client preference. So usually Q1 we see Central lift gets a little weaker in the export sale. Centrilift if you go around and look at the areas, Russia is weaker right now for that very reason and the activity has been down. But Centrilift along with Baker Petrolite those margins have held up and we think will hold up much better through the next several quarters than our D&E side of the business. I do not know if that answers your question.\nMicheal LaMotte - J.P. Morgan\nIf I can ask quickly on the lease/sale mix perhaps that is helping permute the volatility relative to periods in the past. We had downturns in spending. Is that a big factor in smoothing up the revenue stream?\nChadwick Deaton\nThat smoothes up the revenue stream, the leasing side obviously smoothes out the revenue stream.\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro \u2013 Jefferies & Company\nStephen Gengaro \u2013 Jefferies & Company\n\nYou mentioned the strength of you balance sheet and I know from Michael\u2019s questions around acquisitions but are there holes as you look at some of these, more commoditized ITM jobs around the world that you might want to fill as far as your product portfolio allowing you to bid aggressively?\n\nChadwick Deaton\n\nNo, we were able to find the rigs so it does not mean we necessarily have to have a rig contractor. We were able to find sea manning or pressure pumping alliances that we can work with. I do not think that is stopping us from bidding on these projects or winning these projects, Steven. It is not that we were held up because we do not have particular product. Some of our competitors that are winning some of these projects as well have gaps and we have a service that they do not. It does not stop them from winning them. In fact on some of these projects we sell quite a bit of services and products to our competitors are managing these projects.\nStephen Gengaro \u2013 Jefferies & Company\nOkay that is helpful and then as another way to follow up, back to the North American margin question, when you look at your cost cutting and headcount reduction, what plan would you guess that the cost cutting helps margins flatter. Do you need rig count to move higher to get margins flat and then go up or do you think the cost cutting initiatives will stabilize margins at some point late this year.\nChadwick Deaton\nYou do not see margins stabilize as you get coughed out of the system and we hit the low end margins in Q2 and Q3 in North America by then the cost cutting will come in and you will see some stabilizations of margins maybe even a little improvement but it will take an increase in rig count or a consolidation phase to get some capacity up before you see margins do anything meaningful.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Marshall Adkins \u2013 Raymond James\nMarshall Adkins \u2013 Raymond James\n\nLet us come back to the completion and production side. Obviously that business held up much better as usual. Should we expect a delayed reaction here to lower rig count? Are we going to see meaningful margin deterioration and meaningful fall off in that business over the next few quarters or do you think it will just hold up?\nChadwick Deaton\nI think you could see some weakness in margins on the C&P side of the business but I do not think it is not going to be as meaningful as what you obviously see in the D&E side of the business.\nMarshall Adkins \u2013 Raymond James\nRight, just a couple of more clean up items here. Interest expense was up big and depreciation was down, can you give us some guidance going forward on both those issues?\nChadwick Deaton\nDepreciation, I think is going to be pretty flat from here. Interest expense, we issued the bonds in October so interest expense will be pretty flat from here also. We paid off some short term debt in January, February in the first quarter which was not very high rates and so I think it is pretty flat from here.\nAny depreciation was probably down a little bit and it is probably tied back to the bit side of the business because we do capitalize the bits that are leased and with the activity decreased, we have less capitalization and depreciation coming out of these cushions, that might have lowered a little bit in the quarter.\nGary Flaharty\nDennis at this point can we just take one final question please.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Urban \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities\nMichael Urban \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities\nMost of the questions have been answered, I wanted just like to follow-up of on the international side in a broader sense and it is hard to generalize. Some of your competitors have a view the international side, as it often happens, simply on the lag. You the nature of the contracts and projects and things like that seem stable or maybe drifting down subject to a bigger drop later on. I just want to get you opinion on that.\nChadwick Deaton\nI agree with that I think the international side historically is always lagged in the US and North America action. We continue to see international be on a slow drift as long as the oil price stays on that $50 range I think there is still plenty of projects out there that the clients will continue to move forward on at $50 but some of the bigger ultra deep water Arctic, other type projects could be delayed.\nNow if we see some economic recovery towards the end of the year or early next year and oil starts moving back up $60 $70 $75 a barrel then I think that will probably signal the end of the international slow down and we will be in the much better book but I think this is a 12/18 type cycle that we have entered into \nMichael Urban \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities\nWith respect to the oil price it is something we hear pretty often in common that we have $50 oil end projects don\u2019t make sense but how much of a moving target is that with respect to the cost if you have $50 oil and 2008 cost something doesn\u2019t work but we are hearing project costs on some cases coming down 30% or more be it rigs, tubular or things like that. Does that change the equitation and therefore it is more of stability  and sustain instability question at 50 or is that still in absolute terms too low even with the lower cost?\nChadwick Deaton\nI think it is still too low. I do not think your cost are going to come down. For our type of services like rigs and some other things may come down to that effect but I think that $50 oil will still have a tightening or squeezing effect on quite a few projects around the world. I think there is not going to be able to get the cost out fast enough to make up for these projects. These projects if we just look back over the last several years are much more complicated. They require a lot more technology to be able to drill these wells. I just don\u2019t think you will be able to get the cost down low enough to $50 oil on the service side to be able to justify that.\nGary Flaharty\nAlright thanks Mike and thank you Chad, Martin and Peter.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recovered. \nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Stefanie Layton, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nStefanie Layton\nThank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our second quarter 2020 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; and our CFO, Ted Geisler; Jim Hatfield, Chief Administrative Officer; Daniel Froetscher, APS\u2019 President and COO; and Barbara Lockwood, Senior Vice President, Public Policy are also here with us.\nFirst, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today\u2019s comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our second quarter 2020 Form 10-Q was filed this morning.\nPlease refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as risk factors and MD&A sections which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through August 13, 2020. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Guldner\nThank you, Stefanie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'd actually like to begin today's call by expressing my immense appreciation to our team. All of us in leadership stand in awe of their incredible strengths and adaptability. We're continually impressed by their compassion for others and their sheer drive to do their very best each day to serve our customers, our stakeholders and our communities. The culture and engagement that we're striving to create throughout the organization is key to our success in navigating the ongoing COVID-19 challenges. Our plants are operating with impressive reliability during a severe Arizona summer. Our crews have kept the lights on, new customers are being served, and our customers are benefiting from an exceptional commitment to service demonstrated by our people.\nI'm also pleased to report that through the end of the second quarter, we remain in line with our expectations for the year. I'll provide a brief overview of the current status of COVID-19 in Arizona and then some operational and regulatory updates. While weather variations are typical, we experienced an unusually hot second quarter this year that followed a mild second quarter of last year. So Ted will provide more details regarding the impact of weather, given the year-over-year change took us from really one extreme to the other and Ted will then offer a review of our financial performance and our future forecast. \nAs you know, from March 13th through May 12th, many businesses in Arizona were closed and the Governor asked residents to stay home. Governor Ducey's stay home, stay healthy and state connected order expired on May 15th, and in early June, the state began to see an increase in COVID-19 cases. As a result, on June 29th, the Governor paused operations of bars, nightclubs, gyms, movie theaters and water parks through August 10th. And delayed the first day of in-person school to August 17th. The Governor's latest executive order, which was issued on July 9th, limits indoor dining to less than 50% occupancy.\nOn July 30, in his last update, the Governor shared that Arizona's numbers are trending down. Positive cases, emergency room visits from COVID-like symptoms and hospitalizations for COVID cases have all decreased over the last months.\nImportantly, the state is focused on reducing the number of people infected by an infectious person to less than 1. By July 15, Arizona achieved this goal with an R nought of 0.9 and the numbers are continuing to trend down. I know that's the indicator that he's very focused on. As we've stated previously, we cannot predict what the ultimate impact from COVID-19 will be; however, we remain committed to providing relevant and timely information as the COVID pandemic evolves.\nFrom an operations perspective, we continue to execute well under new work protocols. We completed 2 major planned outages, one at Four Corners Unit 5 and a refueling outage of Palo Verde Unit 2 this quarter. Those and other preparatory activities prepared us for a peak summer season, which brings both extreme temperatures and increased customer demand. While we're experiencing above-average wildfire activity this season, our robust fire mitigation efforts, preparation and planning is serving us well in helping to protect the communities we serve and our infrastructure. In at least one instance that fire mitigation training went beyond keeping the power on for our customers.\nI want to share a story about one of our customer servicemen, Ron Walker, who was driving from a job in Sedona to his home in Flagstaff, where he saw a car on fire on the side of the freeway. Without hesitation, Ron pulled over to help using his fire extinguishers, hydration pack and a shovel, to keep the fire from spreading until firefighters could reach the scene some 30 minutes later. Ron's quick, smart and safe actions helped keep the situation from becoming severe and demonstrated his personal commitment and APS' dedication to doing the right thing for our neighbors.\nTurning to another kind of preparation. On June 26, we filed our 15-year integrated resource plan, providing a forward look into our resource planning needs. Between 2020 and 2024, we expect approximately 2,500 megawatts of renewable energy, demand response, energy efficiency and energy storage will be needed to make progress towards our clean energy commitment. We expect the renewable energy additions will include wind and solar generation with the exact mix determined through all source RFP procurement processes. In fact, we're already executing on our plan, we are currently finalizing contract negotiations from our 2019 RFPs for new clean energy resources, and we expect to announce the results soon.\nWe also expect to issue another outsource RFP later this year that will support customer reliability and our clean energy goals. The longer-term look from 2020 through 2035 projects service territory growth driven by population growth, economic growth, data center growth and changing customer trends related to electric vehicles and distributed generation. The positive economic environment Arizona offers to businesses and the state's focus on encouraging technology and development are key drivers there. In addition to resource needs to meet that anticipated growth, approximately 1,400 megawatts of coal are scheduled to be retired and another 1,600 megawatts of gas purchase agreements are scheduled to expire over the next decade.\nThese resource requirements and contract roll-offs, coupled with the need for additional capacity to meet our anticipated peak demand growth, result in the capacity needs of approximately 6,000 megawatts by 2035. We're committed to our goal of being carbon-free by 2050 and the paths outlined in our IRP supports this objective. We also recently released a report on the McMicken battery event that occurred last year. With the conclusion of that investigation, we are now positioned to evaluate the safest and most effective way to move forward, integrating additional storage on our system, including refreshing the energy storage procurement activities that were already underway at the time of the McMicken event.\nOn the regulatory front, the administrative law judge granted the Corporation Commission staff and the Residential Utility Consumer Office's joint request for a 60-day extension to file testimony in our pending rate case. The new date for staff and interveners to file testimony will be October 2, 2020, with rate design testimony due October 9, and the hearing is now scheduled to begin on December 14, 2020. While the rate case and regulatory relationship remain top of mind and key priorities through the remainder of 2020, we're also focused on providing reliable service through our peak summer season, emphasizing our cost management initiatives to support both our financial performance and customer affordability and continuing the transition to a cleaner energy mix.\nLastly, I want to mention that while COVID-19 has created significant challenges, there are many lessons learned and achievements made that we may not have thought possible previously to the pandemic. Our culture transformation is focused on a growth mindset, which means learning from challenges and seeking continuous improvement. And I'm pleased that, that's exactly what we and the team are doing. \nThank you for your time today, and I'll turn it over to Ted.\nTed Geisler\nThank you, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, again, for joining us today. Jeff recognized a number of our team's accomplishments, and I'd also like to add to that by mentioning Jeff's receipt of the Smart Electric Power Alliance Individual Power Player of the Year award. This award recognized Jeff for his demonstrated leadership and innovation to advance clean energy and its value as a resource to help meet the future needs of our customers. On behalf of the entire Pinnacle West team, I want to express our congratulations and appreciation for Jeff's leadership.\nJeff Guldner\nThanks, Ted.\nTed Geisler\nThis recognition for your support, Jeff, of our clean energy plan is well deserved. Turning now to our earnings update. I'll cover our second quarter results, economic activity, successes in our cost savings initiative and forward-looking expectations.\nOur performance in the second quarter remained strong despite impacts of COVID earning $1.71 per share compared to $1.28 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Above-average temperatures, continued cost management and higher pension and OPEB non-service credits contributed to the increase in earnings. As we've highlighted before, weather can be a significant factor in our annual earnings. The above-average temperatures from this quarter, combined with the below-average temperatures in the second quarter last year added $0.43 to earnings year-over-year. Compared to normal, weather added $37 million of pretax gross margin or $0.25 per share. We also experienced 2.4% customer growth in the second quarter 2020 compared to the same period last year. These positive drivers were partially offset by a 1.3% reduction in weather-normalized sales for the quarter, including the impacts from COVID.\nFrom May 13, when businesses started reopening, through July 28, weather-normalized sales were essentially flat compared to the same period last year. We continue to see a reduction in weather-normalized commercial and industrial sales of 4% offset by an increase in weather-normalized residential sales of 4%. In June, we experienced 2.5% customer growth and 0.8% weather-normalized sales growth, reflecting the growth in our service territory and continued improvement in our economy following the full COVID closure period earlier this quarter.\nIn addition to customer growth, weather has been impactful this year, notably, on July 30, between 5 and 6 p.m., our customers required a new all-time high peak energy demand of 7,660 megawatts. This exceeded the prior peak set in 2017 by nearly 300 megawatts. Our company performed exceptionally well and delivered reliable service to our customers across the state in order to keep our communities cool and comfortable. \nI want to thank our entire operations team who stepped up once again to serve customers with reliable power during these extreme conditions. This year's peak demand record is an example of how important our resource planning efforts have become. Although weather-normalized sales may be relatively flat, which reflects full day customer usage, we plan for the summertime peak demand, which informs our resource procurement needs. \nThis means, regardless of sales growth, our customers have a growing peak energy demand that requires new resources and customer programs in order to serve reliably through the summer period. Our recently filed integrated resource plan outlines this point very well.\nWhile the extreme heat has been a driver this year, weather-normalized sales may continue to lag during the near-term as a result of COVID-19. Long term, however, we remain confident in the growth of our service territory. According to the Phoenix business journal, Taylor Morrison Home Corp. had its best month in Scottsdale homebuilders history. \nThe company finished June 2020 with a 94% increase in net sales year-over-year and had an all-time high monthly pace of average sales per community. Further demonstrating the strength in our market, the Phoenix business journal reported 9% year-over-year gains in home price growth during Q2, representing the highest growth among 19 U.S. cities measured by the Case\u2013Shiller Index.\nOn the commercial side, we continue to expect solid growth in our service territory as new developments are announced each month. Amazon recently purchased 91 acres of land next to a 112-acre parcel being developed in a new industrial park. In Metro Phoenix, Merit Partners, the developer of the recently constructed Red Bull and White Claw facilities purchase 83 acres with plans to develop another industrial part. \nAnd in Buckeye, retailer Five Below announced it will build an 850,000 square foot facility with construction expected to be completed in 2021. The center is expected to create 150 jobs initially with plans to grow to 290 jobs in 5 years. While the labor market in Arizona was impacted by COVID, construction was deemed an essential service and work continued throughout the shutdown. \nFor 2020 through the end of May, employment in Metro Phoenix decreased 0.7% compared to 4.4% for the entire U.S. Manufacturing employment in Metro Phoenix decreased 0.5%; however, construction employment increased by 3.1% as local residential and commercial construction projects continue. The economic highlights discussed above reinforced our 2.4% customer growth that we saw this past quarter.\nTurning to cost management. We continue to focus on eliminating waste and achieving efficiencies as a means to keep customer rates affordable. I'd like to share a few recent examples, demonstrating our team's commitment. The procurement operations team delivered new savings by negotiating lower prices with certain vendors through maximizing the competitive bidding process and driving efficiency gains with vendor contracts. \nThese efforts, along with negotiating early paid discounts, contributed approximately $5 million in savings through the end of the second quarter. In addition, our customer service team implemented new process modifications, automation, and revised training that eliminated the need for certain external resources saving approximately $500,000 in 2020, with additional savings planned for 2021. \nSome savings are large, some are on the smaller side. But the point is we're developing a lean culture, where employees continuously look for efficiencies and ways to improve service to our customers. These and other cost savings initiatives helped offset COVID-19 expenses such as testing and PPE. They also allowed our company to support our customers and communities with additional bill assistance and charitable donations during this unprecedented time.\nNow turning to our capital program. The $4.7 billion of CapEx we projected through 2022 on Slide 15 is consistent with the investments needed to support our resource additions, as depicted in the recently filed IRP. As Jeff mentioned, we'll use our standard competitive RFP process to procure additional clean generation resources, and we expect to continue utilizing a mix of owned and purchased resources. For our future earnings expectations and 2020 guidance, despite the impacts from COVID-19 experience thus far, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2020 will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share.\nGiven the impacts of COVID, we reduced our 2020 weather-normalized year-over-year sales growth expectations from 1% to 2% growth to flat to negative 1%. We also reduced our 2020 to 2022 weather-normalized sales expectations from an increase of 1% to 2% to an increase of 0.5% to 1.5%. Offsetting these decreases in 2020 sales is a decrease in adjusted O&M expense, a decrease in interest expense, net of AFUDC, an increase in other income and a decrease in our estimated effective tax rate.\nA complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance can be found on Slides 3 and 4. With respect to financing plans for the remainder of the year, we expect to issue up to $400 million of additional term debt at APS and do not expect to issue equity in 2020. Despite the unexpected circumstances so far this year, we remain focused on hitting our metrics and serving our customers with clean, affordable and reliable power.\nOur team has done a remarkable job working through extreme summer conditions. Embracing new ways of working due to COVID and taking care of our customers with reliable service and industry-leading financial support. Our long-term goals remain intact, and we look forward to taking steps in the near-term to continue implementing our clean energy plan. We are embracing a growth mindset to build upon the learnings from the first half of this year, while delivering value to our shareholders and honoring our commitments to our customers and stakeholders going forward.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session \nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.\nMichael Weinstein\nFor the, on the gross margin financial outlook, where, I noticed it's a little bit lower than back in May. Is that all COVID-related? Or is there some other dynamic that's happening there?\nTed Geisler\nNo, Michael, you're absolutely right. That's just simply reflecting the adjustment in our expected weather-normalized sales for the year given the impacts of COVID.\nMichael Weinstein\nGot it. And then the other numbers are all intending to offset that?\nTed Geisler\nThat's correct.\nMichael Weinstein\nIs it, I think if you add it all up, it comes out to a little bit lower overall expectation than before, although you're maintaining guidance. Are there any other factors that may not be on the page that we -- that would be positive and offsetting?\nTed Geisler\nNo, nothing else there, Michael. We've got ranges listed. We're being conservative with our weather-normalized sales expectations for the balance of the year. As we said through June, we're really at 0.3% negative, but we gave a range of flat to negative 1%. But the other adjustments should offset, but we are confident in our year-end guidance range of $4.75 to $4.95.\nMichael Weinstein\nGot you. And Jeff, with the delay in the procedural schedule a little bit further for the rate case, it looks like the hearings will start after the election. Does this mean that we should wait until after -- into next year probably for any kind of settlement process to take place there? I think we were talking before maybe about a partial settlement in September, but to me, it looks like maybe it all pushed out into next year. Is that the right way to think about it?\nJeff Guldner\nYes, Michael, I mean, you kind of flagged the -- one of the issues, which is when the procedural schedule pushes out, it puts the window between staff and intervenor testimonies. We've said before, typically, you can't really begin a real settlement process before you see staff and intervenor testimony and you book in the ranges. I'd point out, too, that in the last response that the commission staff filed, they were pretty clear that they were looking for an indication from the bench if there was settlement. And otherwise, they're proceeding down a litigated case. And so now you've got an added complexity that bench may change. So we're still open for discussions with anybody that wants to talk about issues. There's still ways that you could potentially take issues off the table. \nI think it's harder to see a comprehensive settlement in a traditional rate case settlement process coming about right now. And if that were to happen, it probably would happen in later -- probably next year. But again, then you're going to be in the middle of the hearings. So we'll have to just watch and see how that develops.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nShahriar Pourreza\nLet me just follow-up on Michael's question on sort of the settlement here. Are you having discussions right now? And sort of how are discussions forming, right? I mean, is it -- are you gaining a little bit of traction here? And then just does the delay in the schedule shifted push your thinking about the timing of the next rate case, and in turn, your plans to sort of raise equity that you've previously said later in '21 or early '22?\nJeff Guldner\nYes, Shahriar, on the settlement question, I mean we're -- to the extent you talk to -- you have a customer, for example, who would come in and say, I'm interested in this kind of new program, you can have those conversations at any point in the process. And so we continue -- I think the notion of kind of the traditional comprehensive settlement discussions those aren't happening. And again, I think staff would be looking for a signal from the bench to begin to do that, and that's less likely to happen, I think, now with this commission. But we're open to talking to anybody who wants to talk about taking issues off the table or working through different aspects. And even if you don't get a comprehensive settlement, it helps you work through issues and make the hearing more streamlined. You kind of have to see how the hearing process goes in order to see what timing effects that would have on the next case. So I don't really -- no change in plans right now, but we need to watch how this case proceeds, I think.\nShahriar Pourreza\nAnd then just, sorry, but I don't know if you addressed the delay in the rate case and how to think about the next rate case in equity?\nTed Geisler\nYes, Shar, this is Ted. The way I think about that is it really depends on the timing and outcome of the current case we're in. So once this case concludes, we'll evaluate the outcome, and that will really inform the timing of the next case as well as timing of equity needs.\nShahriar Pourreza\nAnd then just most of the recent renewable clean target proposals in the energy rules docket, i.e., the staffs and Burns and Kennedys seems to follow the goals you guys have already put out. Are there any kind of puts or takes that we should be thinking about as the dialogue continues with interim step targets i.e., every five years, be less desirable than a straightforward endpoint, i.e., neutral 2050? And has there been any more conversations about alternative mechanisms i.e., a writer for solar and storage, so you don't have to be a serial filer? Or is the preference with the ACC and stakeholders just to keep things status quo?\nTed Geisler\nYes, Shar, I think what's encouraging is directionally, it feels like there's a lot of alignment in terms of the direction we're going. Obviously, the details are important. And you do have to look at, I think, some of the comments that we make and other parties would make is how do you think about interim goals? So we wanted to make sure with ours that we didn't just set a 2050 target and then nothing until 2050. \nAnd so we had put a 2030 goal in place. The challenge is it get more granular as it just gets harder on the procurement, so you lose some flexibility. So if you were to have goals every year, every two years, then it's a little bit harder to try to do the procurement and the flexibility that you can get around different technologies with that. And so it's an evolving conversation. I think that just watch the filings and the comments that come into those, to that docket.\nWith respect to tracking mechanisms, I expect there'll be some conversation about that in the current rate case because you're exactly right on the impact of that, if you don't do a tracking mechanism of some sort or some kind of regulatory mechanism, then it just pushes you into a pretty continuous rate case filing stream. And so there's value, we think, in that. But again, that's part of what I expect will be the evidence that will be heard in the rate case that we've got on file right now.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore.\nDurgesh Chopra\nOn the guidance front, the reduction in interest expense, it's partly driven by higher AFUDC, what is driving that? And are you just assuming lower rates now in the updated assumption?\nJeff Guldner\nYes. That's exactly right. It's updated with our current financing, the current rate and then higher, net of higher AFUDC than originally projected.\nDurgesh Chopra\nAnd then just one small one. The CapEx plan did not change, but the rate base is modestly higher, and this may be too much into the reads. I'm looking at your slide where you actually put out rate base and break it into the company and FERC, and it's modestly higher, but the CapEx plan didn't change. What is driving that?\nJeff Guldner\nYes. So that's just simply an update in the rate base projection given the CapEx forecast that we previously released. We did not change any of our forward-looking projections in the last quarter. But as you can see this time, we updated most to reflect both impacts of COVID as well as update rate base to be in line with the recently issued CapEx forecast. So it's just getting those 2 in sync.\nDurgesh Chopra\nI get it. So this is basically up-to-date and ties with your most recent CapEx forecast?\nJeff Guldner\nThat's correct.\nDurgesh Chopra\nOkay. Understood. And then just one last question. In terms of the COVID trends and demand trends, you're saying you're pretty conservative in, for the back half of the year, assuming that the trends are as to what you saw in Q2, would that put you in the high end of the guidance range?\nJeff Guldner\nWell, I think it's too early to project. The COVID situation is still fairly uncertain. But the way I think about it is we're pleased to see that since the reopening in mid-May, we've seen the decline in commercial sales be evenly offset by the increase of residential, and that's an important metric for us. But other than that, we'll just continue to focus on how things normalize for the balance of the year.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim\nMy first question, regarding the delayed staff testimony and the filings associated with that. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like it still opened up the possibility of a change in the test year for this rate case. Is that correct? And if that is the case, what is the process? And if it were to get changed, would it be the commission's decision at by a certain day to make that happen?\nTed Geisler\nNo, I don't think Insoo. It's not a change in the test year. You may change some of the pro formas. I mean, that's something we'd have to look at for the rebuttal case. But the test year was the test year we filed. And again, we make adjustments in post test year plan and other things to that test year.\nInsoo Kim\nRight. And in terms of the post test year adjustments, would it allow you with is a way to extend the time line for post test year adjustments?\nTed Geisler\nI mean, I guess that's possible. I think you'd have to see how the case would evolve.\nInsoo Kim\nGot it. And then, in terms of the renewable process, kind of following up on a couple of the other questions. I think at this point in Arizona, it's more of an acknowledgment or not acknowledgment process for when you file an IRP. As you weighed into all of the capacity investments in renewables and storage over the next few years, are there any conversations that you're trying to have with the commission to establish more of a soft approval or acknowledgment further for those type of investments?\nTed Geisler\nYes, there, I guess, I'd say there is, and I'll ask Barbara to chime in if she's got a different, or some additional information. But the IRP process itself is an acknowledgment process, right? And there's some discussions about what would happen with that under the new energy rules. That's probably a topic of discussion that could come up in the new energy rules debate. When you get into down the individual RFPs, it gets a little more nuanced because there could be things that do require commission approval and there could be things that don't. In a lot of cases, you wouldn't be going through a siting committee approval because these aren't thermal plants, so they're not subject to this state Siting Act. But I think there, it's going to be something we'll watch as the rules evolve as to how the approval process goes for. Do you want to add anything, Barbara?\nBarbara Lockwood\nYes, Insoo, this is Barbara Lockwood. I would say the way to think about it is the conversation is evolving to more engagement with the commission and stakeholders through both the IRP process as well as the RFP process and approval or acknowledgment is all in discussion on various components associated with that. But really, the best way to think about it right now is the discussion is how to engage more with the commission through those processes as well as with the stakeholders. Nothing definitive in that regard yet.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Patterson\nPaul, I apologize if I missed this, but the sales growth change over the long term, what caused you to change that?\nTed Geisler\nPaul, that's really just reflecting the flat to negative expected weather normalized sales growth we see in 2020. So given it's a 3-year period, including 2020, we just want to make sure that we updated that period to reflect the expected 2020 results and impacts as a result of COVID.\nPaul Patterson\nSo when COVID is over, whenever that is, you guys don't really expect to see sort of a catch-up, so to speak, you see basically just sort of things progressing pretty much as they were before. Is that the right way to think about it? So it's kind of a lost year as opposed to -- not lost year, but if you follow me like COVID will cause a decrease for this year. And then off of that -- then you'll get back to where you were before, your growth rate will be the same, but there won't be some big rebound in terms of catch-up. Is that the right way to think of it?\nTed Geisler\nI think that's a fair way to think about it. A couple of data points for you. As I mentioned, the economy remains robust in virtually every measure you look at it. If you look at June, of course, the most recent month in this period, we had 2.5% customer growth. We had 0.8% weather-normalized sales growth and that's during what I would still consider to be a COVID period. We look to the future, difficult to predict, of course. But we want to make sure we reflected updated guidance over the next 3 years that did include the impacts we're seeing in 2020. That said, those numbers do exclude contributions we'd expect from data centers, and so that provides upside as well.\nPaul Patterson\nOkay. And then you also mentioned, and I apologize if -- I didn't get it completely, but you mentioned something about your peak growth hasn't been changed, I think or I apologize again, I heard it, but I got slightly distracted. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on what you meant by the peak growth and how that -- I guess, it's still driving your -- it doesn't -- in other words, your CapEx is less affected, I guess, by the sales growth at South, but more by the peak growth?\nTed Geisler\nYes, that's exactly right, Paul. One of the key pieces is regardless of annual sales growth, we plan for the long-term to ensure that we're there on the hottest day of the year when our customers need us the most and that's the peak demand day. This year, that peak demand day increased demand by over 300 megawatts compared to the last all-time high, which is significant. And that's really what's driving our resource procurement needs and the integrated resource plan for the long-term is making sure that we've got resource capacity plus reserves to maintain reliable service during peak demand on a forward-looking basis.\nPaul Patterson\nOkay. And that really hasn't changed -- that really hasn't -- okay. And I think the rest of my questions have been asked and answered. Just on the energy rules, I mean, there does seem to be some sort of an impasse, I guess, at least currently, and I know the commission probably will be changing in November. So any thoughts on that? Or does it have any -- is it sort of just a wait-and-see sort of situation? Or is there any other takeaway from that, do you think?\nBarbara Lockwood\nYes. Paul, this is Barbara Lockwood. I think that's true. There's a philosophical alignment on many parts of the energy rules, but the procedure and the process for making policy and getting through to a vote seems to be complicated, and it's just a wait and see right now. They're discussing it again today to see if they can find a process to move forward. But at this point, it really is just a wait and see from a procedural perspective, if they can get anywhere.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.\nCharles Fishman\nYou have consistently left data center growth out of your forecast, which certainly makes sense because, I guess, that moves the needle. And I guess my just general question is, with this work-at-home trend going on and potentially benefiting data center growth, are you seeing anything specific to the Phoenix area with respect to the data center growth that you can provide color on?\nJeff Guldner\nYes. Charles, that's an insightful question. The short answer is nothing specific that we can point to. But when we look at technology trends and expected data center demand, we certainly recognize the point you're making, which is, if you have the parallel, keep systems and data up and running, both in corporate network and at home, then there's a potential to increase demand. But I'd say that's hypothesis by many and nothing specific that we can point to at this time. \nOur focus for the data center growth is really the customers that we know that we're interconnecting, that we are building out capacity for, and it's still early in that process. As you can probably imagine, we plan for their peak capacity, but what they actually use is uncertain until they start to fill out the shell of the data center. And so that's why we exclude it because it's got some long term, very strong demand, but it's just unclear on the trajectory in which they fall to fill up that demand.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\nI want to revisit the subject a little bit here, but I wanted to address it more directly. So you will have a pretty substantive clean energy spend in your outlook for next year and the year after. And you've made an allusion into the course of the call about a potential for some sort of tracking type mechanism to avoid a subsequent case. In the context of the current case, you've talked about recovery. Can you suggest more directly, what would be the sort of ideal avenue for pathway of recovery? \nAnd then secondly, to the extent which that this rate case is perhaps protracted and broadly defined, do you anticipate that, or do you have confidence [indiscernible] spend in '21 for the clean energy capital without having the certainty of any specific writers, et cetera? I understand you probably could move ahead and do it, but do you have the specific projects lined up and at least you're organizationally and operationally ready to make those investments without the recovery writers at play?\nJeff Guldner\nYes, Julien, you're a little muffled at a couple of times there. I think I got the gist of your question. And so yes, we do plan in the case to talk about how a tracking mechanism could work and what the existing mechanisms are. I think that's going to be a topic of a lot of discussion. And to the point that was raised earlier, if you don't have a tracking mechanism, what happens is, it just increases the pace of which you have to file rate cases. We've got a combination of the clean energy commitment. \nI think, general alignment on where clean energy is going in the state from a lot of different parties and what you heard in my comments is that we also have a growing capacity need. And so we're going to have to be building out the wind, solar and batteries to meet the capacity needs that we're going to have. And so yes, we'd like to tie it to a tracking mechanism and make sure we have a good discussion around that. See if there are existing mechanisms like the RES or other things that we could potentially use and expect that's going to have a fair amount of discussion in the rate case. But the reliability needs are going to drive some of that spending as well.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\nRight. But maybe just to be clear about this, operationally, do you have projects identified for 2021? I know you don't have necessarily the recovery mechanism but do you have the specific projects already sort of teed up for 2021 that you anticipate pursuing? And what's the nature of those projects, if you can speak to them? Just, I know, historically, there's been these competitive processes for larger-scale projects, what's the nature of what you anticipate spending in '21, more specifically, if you can speak to it?\nDaniel Froetscher\nJulien, this is Daniel Froetscher. Prior to our McMicken event, we had a number of solar, solar plus storage projects teed up for progression through '21, '22 and '23. And now post McMicken, we'll be dusting them off and moving them forward, integrating the learnings from our McMicken event from an engineering design and safety standpoint. Jeff has alluded to significant resource roll-offs occurring over the next few years. Ted has alluded to customer growth. So absent any tracker, we still have reliability and service obligations that we plan to meet through the combination of wind, solar and battery and have every intention of doing so, to benefit our customers.\nWe've got a couple of tranches of battery storage to accompany our Arizona sun photovoltaic installations that we built a number of years ago. We've got a couple of PPAs that were teed up, have been placed on the shelf since McMicken that we've been working with those suppliers throughout the course of our McMicken learnings to incorporate again the safety, design and engineering improvements that are needed there. And we have a couple of current RFPs out that Jeff mentioned in his opening remarks, within which we'll be making decisions shortly in either the wind, solar or both spaces as it relates to those RFPs. So there is real work in play.\nTed Geisler\nYes. Thanks, Daniel. And Julien, I'd just summarize by saying we're going to execute on that 2021 capital plan, whether it be the RFPs, Daniel mentioned, or projects that we have coming up, we will be executing on that plan.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\nGot it. So it sounds like you're pretty confident regardless of the construct of recovery?\nTed Geisler\nThat's correct. Although certainly, recovery is what we've made clear is necessary to be able to execute clean plan in the long term, promote rate gradualism and ensure that you don't have serial rate case filings.\nOperator\nWe have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nStefanie Layton\nThank you for joining us today. This concludes our call.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer period. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I would now like to introduce Mr. Eduardo Fleites, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Fleites, you may begin your conference. \nEduardo Fleites - Director of Investor Relations\nThank you, Celeste. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for today's call where we will be discussing Citrix's first quarter 2007 revenue and financial highlights. Participating in this call will be Mark Templeton, President and Chief Executive Officer, and David Henshall, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast with a slide presentation on the Citrix Systems investor relations website, and the slide presentation will be posted immediately following the call. \nBefore we begin our review, I want to reiterate changes introduced last quarter regarding the format of our product performance discussions. We have classified our products into four groupings that map to the evolution of our business. The four groupings include, application virtualization products, application networking products, online services and other, which contains our emerging products. This product classification and historical revenue trends, related to these four groupings have been posted to our website, and David will be discussing their performance in his prepared remarks. \nAs we get started, I want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call may be characterized as forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the U.S. securities laws. These statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially including risks associated with the company's businesses involving the company's revenue growth, products, their development and distribution, product demand in the pipeline, economic and competitive factors, the company's key strategic relationships, the effect of new accounting pronouncements on revenue and expense recognition, including the effect of FAS 123R on certain of the Company\u2019s GAAP financial measures, acquisition and related integration risks, intellectual property related risks, and the company\u2019s ongoing review of its stock options grants and practices and the related accounting. \nAdditional information concerning these factors is highlighted in the earnings press release and in the company's filings with the SEC including the risk factors, disclosure contained in our most recent form 10-Q filing available from the SEC or the company's investor relations website. Additionally during this call, we may discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. Now I would like to turn it over to David Henshall, our Chief Financial Officer. David? \n  \nTRANSCRIPT SPONSOR  \n    Do you get frustrated during earnings season? Have you had trades go south because of bad earnings dates? We know what it's like. We\u2019ve been there.

Today I'm pleased to report first quarter 2007 revenue and financial lights for the company demonstrating continued growth across our geographic segments and product areas. In addition to providing you with some commentary on our performance, I'll discuss the current trends in our business and review our current outlook for Q2 in the full year 2007, but before I get started I want to provide you with an update to the ongoing stock option review. As we previously discussed, at the end of Q4 last year the audit committee initiated a voluntary independent review of historical stock option administration over the past 11 years. Unfortunately, due to the scope of the work and the number of parties involved, the review is not yet complete. \nSo the company has been unable to file its 2006 form 10-K with the SEC. Because of this, the financial information reported today is preliminary and limited and does not take into account any adjustments that will be required in connection with the completion of this review. Since the adjustments will affect historical FAS 123R and other expenses, we are unable to provide a complete set of financial statements for the first quarter. At this point though, the audit committee is just about complete with the fact-finding portion of the review and has reached certain determinations. So please refer to our press release for more information. The various parties are currently working to conclude the accounting and tax analysis, and we are obviously very eager to wrap that up as soon as possible so that we can become current with our SEC filings and NASDAQ requirements. \nIn addition, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we underestimated the amount of time and expense that it would take to complete the review. We incurred professional services fees in Q1 of about $6 million, including outside accounting, auditing, legal and tax advisors, the large majority of this expense was not included in our financial guidance for Q1. So let's get back to the financial summary. As you can see from the reported revenue numbers up 18% over Q1 '06, we started 2007 on a great note demonstrating continued momentum and solid execution across our strategy. So looking at the business, there are four key areas I would like to review. First, our application virtualization products and the momentum of our subscription advantage program. Second the company's continued success delivery in software service. Third, our work to establish Citrix as a leading player in the application networking market, and fourth, the emerging products and technologies that we have built and acquired to help fuel future growth. \nSo first let me focus on our application virtualization products. The group grew 8% in Q1 to $224 million in overall revenue, including a 2% decline in license revenue. We anticipated a modest license revenue decline based on the tough comps resulting from last year's end of sale of presentation server XP edition. We continue to see very strong demand for customers renewing their software update subscriptions, over 85% renewal rate in Q1 demonstrating the value delivered by PS 4.5 enhancements and other products. In addition, we have received very positive response from our channel and customers to the changes made to the presentation server line of products. Specifically, PS platinum edition showed solid adoption generating almost 4% of group license sales while only being available for the last three weeks of the quarter. \nWe believe that the changes to the PS product line are positive for customers and partners by delivering significantly more value than prior versions, and for Citrix, these changes should allow us to continue to increase adoption by new customers and also provide a compelling upgrade path to the installed base. The second area of focus is regarding our continued success delivering software as a service. Our GoTo products continue to meet the needs of customers in this rapidly growing segment of the market, which demands secure, affordable, fast, and easy software as a service offerings. Revenue from these products in Q1 was over 47 million, growing nearly 50% from Q1 '06. Within this group, the GoToMyPC products represented about half of total revenue and grew 33% over Q1 last year. \nGoToAssist contributed about a quarter of the revenue and grew over 30% from a year ago and finally the online collaboration products including GoToMeeting and GoToWebinar continued to be the fastest growth up about a 138% over last year. The third area I would like to highlight is the progress we're making to establish Citrix as a leading player in the application networking market. Our networking products group grew over 50% compared to Q1 '06. We saw continuing strength in the NetScaler product with an increasing percentage of business coming from traditional enterprise customers, and we closed the quarter with over 430 certified NetScaler partners, up over 70 from the December quarter. In addition, we introduced our WAN optimization product, WANScaler into the channel this quarter and generated about $1 million in revenue. We're working on training and certifying qualified partners and to date have already certified over 120 WANScaler partners globally. And the final area I would like to discuss is the performance of our emerging product areas. These groups grew in the triple digits in Q1 albeit off a very small base. The growth in this area was primarily driven by the editions of EdgeSight and Ardence acquisitions. Ardence targets enterprises were strategic diskless computer initiatives where cost, security, and energy consumption are major requirements. During the first quarter, Ardence billed over $4 million to customers, but due to a purchase accounting adjustment, we recognized less than $2 million of revenue. \nWhile it's pretty early in the rollout, we have added ten North American partners in the quarter to resell the Ardence desktop and data center additions. And finally, EdgeSight which provides application performance visibility continues to gain traction, really driving customers to upgrade to our PS platinum edition. So in total we are proud to have delivered a performance that gives us a solid foundation to execute on for the remainder of 2007. And Mark will address some of these items in more detail during his comments. Now let me talk briefly about expenses and operations. As a reminder, cost and expenses reported to today do not include stock-based compensation expense under FAS 123R. \nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2007, total cost of revenue and operating expenses, was approximately $250 million. Let me tell you what that includes. It includes total cost of product license and service revenue, total R&D sales and marketing and G&A expenses, amortization expense of approximately $10 million, a $1 million write-off of in-process R&D relating to the closing of the Ardence acquisition, and approximately $6 million of accounting, legal, and tax fees, related to the ongoing stock option review. The increase in costs this quarter, were driven primarily by the fees related to the option review, the OpEx associated with recent acquisitions and ongoing head count investments. \nRegarding head count growth we ended the first quarter with over 3,900 employees, up a 191 people. The largest increases were related to the 100 employees added through the Ardence acquisition and additions to the sales and services and Citrix online teams. But because of the ongoing options review, we're not in a position to provide any more detail on the P&L or our standard non-GAAP financial measures. So on the balance sheet, cash and investments increased over $100 million from the December quarter now total over 900 million. Deferred revenue grew $20 million in the quarter, bringing the total to 376 million, up 29% from Q1 '06. The driving factors here include the ongoing success of our subscription advantage and get-current programs as well as online subscriptions. \nOur AR balance at the end of the quarter, was just over 168 million, yielding a DSO of 49 days, which is back within our target range of 45 to 55 days, which I talked about on the Q4 '06 call. So before I talk about guidance, let me just pause for a second. I understand that the limits in this report may be disappointing to some of you. I can certainly tell you it is to me, and while I'm very pleased with the Q1 performance, I would much rather been talking about the results with our usual granularity. Like I said before, we're getting close on the options review and really look forward to talking to you upon the completion of that time. \nNot withstanding that the company has delivered consistent growth, while still balancing significant investments in the new businesses and the routes to market that are important for long-term success. While many of our initiatives are still in their early stages, I believe that we have created a solid foundation to build on for the remainder of 2007. \nSo finally, I would like to discuss our current outlooks and expectations for the second quarter ending June 30th and for the full year. It should be noted that we're about to make forward-looking statements that incorporate certain risks, so please refer to the safe harbor statements noted in our press release and the rest that are stated in our SEC filings. So to provide you with some context around our forward outlook, we're continuing to see solid revenue traction across multiple areas of the business and are optimistic that the investments we have been making will help sustain the momentum over the next several quarters. We're also seeing a number of areas that we believe are additional investment opportunities to further enhance the platform in our ability to reach even more customers. \nSo with this, for the second quarter, we currently expect total revenue in the range of $317 to $324 million, including contribution of $49 to $50 million from our online services. Total cost of revenue and operating expenses in the range of approximately 254 million to 258 million. Included in this number are amortization expenses in the range of $10 to $11 million, and $3 million for accounting, legal, and tax fees, related to the ongoing stock option review. This estimate second quarter, however, does not take in to account any stock-based compensation expense, or any other charges that may result from the conclusion of the voluntary stock option review. For the full year 2007, we now expect a total revenue in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.33 billion, an increase of approximately $20 million from our prior guidance. \nTotal cost of revenue and operating expenses to be in the range of $1.03 billion, to 1.04 billion, and included in this number is an estimated of amortization expenses in the range of $41 to $42 million, a $1 million write-off of in-process R&D related to the closing of the Ardence acquisition, and $9 million in total accounting, legal, and tax fees, related to the ongoing stock option review. And again, this estimate for full year, fiscal 2007 spending does not take in to account, any stock-based compensation expense or other charges likely to result from the volunteer stock option review. Now I would like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on the quarter's performance and to discuss our ongoing business. Mark? \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, David. I'm really pleased with our first quarter performance. 2007 is off to a terrific start. The business is looking really solid. The pipeline growth for PS platinum edition is really impressive. It's giving us great confidence in the positioning, pricing, packaging, and integration moves we made in that area. We're also seeing EdgeSight have a really positive impact on PS business in general and even influencing several significant upgrades to platinum. \nOur application networking products grew 50% including a solid sequential growth from NetScaler. Increasing renewal rates of license updates as David mentioned a record of 85% in Q1, really confirms the customer value and features we have added to our products over the past few quarters. Growth in technical services was 28% for the quarter, showing that we're now helping customers more and more architect and implement much larger, more strategic systems and our online division growth of 50% now puts us on trajectory to exceed $200 million in that area of revenue this year. So these are the positive indicators that really make me bullish about the business. \nSo next I would like highlight some other aspects of our first quarter, including the launch of our 643 program as well as products we announced. In January, we hosted our annual sales and partner event, Summit '07 where we unveiled the industry's most comprehensive vision for application delivery. More than 3,000 Citrix partners and employees came to Orlando. We educated them and trained them based upon a well-defined game plan called 643. This plan makes it simpler for them to capitalize on complete application delivery solutions. Here is what it means for the next 12 to 18 months our to GoTo market strategy is focused on six strategic application delivery products targeting four different IT buyers, and three core selling strategies for medium, large, and global enterprises around the world. \nAcross our partner and field teams, 643 has been received enthusiastically, and it's already producing results. There are six strategic points of presence for an end to end delivery system. It begins with a trio of products that deliver applications right at their point of origin, presentation server for delivering Windows-based client server and desktop application, NetScaler for delivering web-based applications with the best performance and security, and desktop server for delivering Windows desktop through virtualization to office workers in a whole new way. Next there are a pair of products that live at the point of control. Access gateway for securing access to all application types whether they are Windows or web, WANScaler for accelerating the delivery of applications to branch office users. \nA product we introduced during Summit, for the first time to Citrix partners, and for visibility in to the users' access experience, we have a product that lives at the point of access right with the user and that\u2019s EdgeSight for application performance monitoring. These six products are the focus of our field and partner organizations. Our GoTo market strategy targets four different types of IT buyers. First there is IT infrastructure ops. The person who is accountable for delivering windows applications, especially for line of business purposes. \nThen there's the network architect, the person who is directly responsible for delivering web applications with the best security and performance. Then there are desktop operations, the person who deals with Window's desktops, who\u2019s now trying to figure out how to migrate to Microsoft Vista and Office 2007 and then there's the CIO or the strategic IT buyer. This is the person responsible for the success of all applications, who oversees the infrastructure, networking, and desktop delivery decisions and, most importantly, makes sure that IT is enabling the business. The third component of the plan focuses on the specific tools, programs, and incentives to help our field teams execute these three sales strategies. \nFirst, we're amplifying our application delivery message. Our teams are out there telling the full Citrix story about, first, the business flexibility that our infrastructure enables, and second, how we can reduce costs, improve performance, and ensure security from end to end when delivering any application. The second strategy is to penetrate and upgrade the presentation server install base. We're selling and up selling a complete solution by leading with a new platinum addition of presentation server a much more feature rich offering. And the third strategy is to acceleration our application networking business by leveraging existing relationships. We're synchronizing every Citrix partner to get authorized and cross-sell our application networking products bringing our App delivery value to network buyers within many established Citrix accounts. \nSo that's our game plan for 2007, our teams are really enthusiastic. Why? Because 6-4-3 is simple, it differentiates us. It differentiates them, and aligns strategy execution and compensation incentives for everyone and its already having an impact let me give you an example. Within a week after summit a North American rep had a customer meeting originally set up to discuss a deal for a 100 seats of presentation server. Rather than having that discussion he used his summit training and led with the full Citrix story around application delivery, and presented a more complete solution, which included all six products, including the new PS platinum edition. A $20,000 PS opportunity, turned in to a broader solution featuring multiple products and a six-figure opportunity PS Platinum opportunity for 1 to $2,000 seats. The visibility of this project may even lead to a larger opportunity for the customer to standardize on over 15,000 seats. \nSo a tactical customer meeting turned into strategic conversation, based upon the 6-4-3 game plan. Our plan is helping partners execute and win by leveraging the most compelling value proposition that Citrix has ever had to offer. At a time when application delivery is becoming a defining issue for IT. This plan relies on consistent delivery against the product pipeline we have established over the past year. So I would like to highlight the new product shipments that we have seen since the beginning of the year and mention others that are still in development. First is presentation server. It was really a big quarter for our application virtualization team. Shipping presentation server 4.5, version 4.5 includes the release of the new platinum edition, making presentation server the only product on the market that virtualizes and streams and secures, and measures the delivery of both corporate and personal window's Apps. Simply stated it's now a legitimate main stream solution for the delivery of all windows applications. \nAt $600 per CCU presentation server platinum is priced at the same level as the access suite, our previous top of the line bundled offering, but it delivers more value by integrating some of the newest technologies, including application performance monitoring with EdgeSight, secure application access with access gateway our new application streaming capability for the on demand delivery of windows desktop applications, and the early customer response has been impressive. We're seeing the leading indicators of customer moving up the product family stack from advanced to enter prize, from enterprise to platinum, driving a higher ASP for the entire PS product family. \nNext is desktop server. Desktop server was introduced earlier this month and expands our product line to include the delivery of virtualized windows desktops delivered securely from the data center. The debut of this new technology marks our entrance in to the high potential virtual desktop market, a market expected to grow dramatically over the next few years. Analysts have estimated that as many as 400 million window's desk tops will be upgraded to Microsoft's new window's Vista, faced with large sale migrations many organizations are reevaluating their desktop delivery methods, looking for most cost effective, secure, and reliable ways to do this. We believe an on demand service based in the data center is a better way to deliver a window's desk top to most office workers. \nThe early feedback we're getting from customer and partners is very positive. In fact the tech preview of desktop server has been downloaded by over 3,000 unique customers since it was first made available. We have already identified 10 enterprise customers that will pilot version 1.0 which is available now. We continue to view 2007 as a year for educating, testing and piloting with desktop server customers this is the state of the virtual desktop market for 2007. And we expect revenue to begin contributing in 2008. In January, we closed the acquisition of Arden's, and it's now running as a Citrix division. Arden's has the core IT and technology for real time provisioning of operating systems. It's amazing technology that allows IT operations teams to centrally boot desktops, servers, blades and other devices from Arden\u2019s V-Disc images. \nThink of it this way, you can power on a bare metal device and the operating system can be streamed to it over the network in real time. Taking full advantage of local processing power, these provisioning capabilities are very effective in the data center. In fact Arden's data center edition is a powerful tool for simplifying the management and migration of larger scale presentation server environments. With data center edition, a virtual disk image of a configured presentation server or any of its components can be streamed to disk-less bare metal servers in real time saving hugely on data center storage, power, and administration. With the product\u2019s roll back, roll forward feature, it's simple to trial test and implement, new versions of presentation server even including patches to the underlying window's server operating system. \nIn Q1 in actually last month of the quarter, we had five Citrix customers buy licenses for Arden's data center edition to provision their upgrade to presentation server 4.5. We expect to see more of this in Q2 and going forward. Next, NetScaler 8.0, with the recent release of NetScaler version 8.0, we continue to raise the bar for delivering web applications with the best performance, security, and cost savings. In this release, NetScaler now fully integrates the market-leading web App firewall from our earlier (indiscernible) acquisition, making it easy to secure, sensitive application data, without deploying a separate product. This release all gives network managers the ability to monitor end user performance of web Apps. By integrating our Edge site application performance monitoring technology NetScaler becomes the first and only web App delivery system to offer this important capability built in. We believe measuring end user experience is critical for customers, and this feature is a game changer in the web App delivery landscape. \nVersion 8.0 also includes significant enhancements to the (indiscernible) expert policy engine. Our AP ex for visual policy builder makes it easy for network architects to customize NetScaler for any enterprise web. Apps, App expert rules can be created via easy to use graphical interfaces and intuitive policy options. Network architects are not required to become software programmers or application experts, nor do they need to pay consultants thousands of dollars per day to write custom scripts for each application. Additionally, AP expert policy framework makes it easier to mix and match functions offering higher levels of service. This release sets new ease of use standards for configuring powerful application and user-specific policies. \nWhile the competition in this market is strong, we have once again raised the bar and established a level of differentiation that we believe is unmatched. Next is WANScaler, WANScaler just introduced at summit as I mentioned addresses application delivery for branch offices. During the conference we offered training classes, allowing partners to get authorized to sell this new product on-site. Training class attendance was standing room only and we have already authorized over 120 partners. Even though we're in the early stages of ramping WANScaler, the leading indicators are strong. There is strong interest from both partners and customers and increasing growth in our opportunity pipeline, it's both a Greenfield and competitive market. So we are staying aggressive with development and distribution. \nLater this quarter we'll be announcing WANScaler version 4.1. So stay tuned. That's the progress we made overall during Q1 with the six products we are promoting to medium, large, and global enterprises. I'm pleased with it, and I think it's a tremendous, tremendous quarter. Next, I would like to talk about our online services as David mentioned, our software service products really targeting the presumer (ph) and F&B customers continue to perform extremely well, growing at a 50% clip. These products continue to set a high bar for competition and for financial results. We saw a record increase in deferred revenue from online services during Q1, in both GoToMyPC and Go To assist revenues grew over 30% revenues from GoToMeeting and GoToWebinar accounted for over a quarter of the online services revenue and continue to grow at triple digit rates. \nWe like what we're seeing with GoToWebinar it\u2019s a game changing product that makes it very easy for anyone to demonstrate train and present information to large audiences over the web. Historically online events have been pretty complex processes, often involving 50 to 100 time consuming steps. GoToWebinar is winning because it reduces it\u2019s a three self service steps, making it very simple to deliver a successful Webinar. It's also the only Webinar product that can simultaneously reach 1,000 attendees for less than the cost of a mobile phone service. Having contributed over $47 million this quarter our online services are now on a trajectory to surpass $200 million in revenue this year. \nSo overall our momentum continues to build, while IT spending is growing at a meager single-digit rate, we have been growing in the double digits, substantially faster than the market. I believe we can continue to do so. We're in some of the hottest areas in today's software market, virtualization, application networking and software as a service. This gives us three business engines to deliver sustainable growth over the coming years. These growth engines give us tremendous confidence in our future, at the same time we're anticipating customer needs by acquiring core technology and building an exciting pipeline of new products during Q1 we acquired Ardence. Technology will enable us to improve monitoring and management of processor work Loads across presentation server environments, and all of our products that are built on top of window's server 2003 and long horn server. \nWe also acquired (indiscernible) a product that provides an intuitive load-testing solution designed to determine how presentation server and desktop server configurations will scale, helping our customers remove performance bottlenecks and eliminating risks associated with system changes. We're also expanding our partnership with Microsoft through the joint development of a new branch office in a box appliance that we have discussed in this past this will further extend our WAN opportunities and increase our addressable market opportunity. And we're also building a work force continuity FAS product. A project we code name Kent that gives businesses on-demand communication, collaboration, and application delivery capabilities that they need to handle unforeseen vents that prevent workers from getting to the office. \nOur pace of investment and our vision for App delivery has put us in an amazing position. The business relevance of application delivery infrastructure is growing rapidly, driven by the velocity of business change that will be emblematic of the next five years. We're offering the kind of flexibility, security, and efficiencies that businesses need from IT now and in the future. So, next we would like to open it up for questions. Celeste? \nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, at this time I would like to remind you, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then the No. 1 on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs. \nSarah Friar - Goldman Sachs\nThe quarter, Mark, could you help me with those ME application Virtualization area, do you think we're now at a point where license revenue can start to grow there now that we have gone through some assessable comps on your 4.5 and some of those price increases kicking in? \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nI think we're well positioned for that, Sarah. I think Q2 we still had a little hang over from the XP end of sales from last year, but I think all of the moves that we have made, really are setting us up well for, especially the back end of the year. \nSarah Friar - Goldman Sachs\nSo then as you think of the full year license growth rate, is mid-single digits back to where you kind of where you used to guide to, does that seem realistic? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nHey Sarah this is David let me answer that I think that you know consistent with what we have said for a long time, we still look at this as a you know a low single-digit growth business. \nSarah Friar - Goldman Sachs\nOkay. \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nNo change to that outlook at this point in time. You know as Mark mentioned I think that you know we're pretty optimistic about all the changes we have made in PS product line, the ability that we have got to bring a lot more value to customers through platinum, which will you know ultimately have the effect of raising ASPs and things like that if we're successful. So we think we're making a lot of moves we\u2019re positioned and looking forward to the rest of the year. \nSarah Friar - Goldman Sachs\nAnd I have just one other quick one for you David, Can you give us any sense on cash flow from OPS. I know that you weren't able to give a lot of detail? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nUnfortunately I'm really precluded from talking about a lot of the you know the other financial metrics that we usually discuss just given the fact that P&O is not complete. But I point you to the, you know, to the normal main drivers of cash flow, it you know, the change in AR, the change in deferred and net income. And we'll be in a position to give a more complete cash flow statement. As soon at the option review is concluded. \nSarah Friar - Goldman Sachs\nOkay, great. Thanks a lot. \nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Adam Holt with J.P. Morgan. \nAdam Holt - J.P. Morgan Securities\nGood afternoon. Thank you. I had a couple of questions on the application networking business. You gave the license number for Virtualization, would you be comfortable giving us the same number for App Networking. And then secondly as you look at the trajectory around WANScaler and how trapping into the channel, do you still feel comfortable that that business can do you know over 10 million in licensed revenue for this year? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nLet me take the second part of that question first. You know, we\u2019re consistent with where we were when we acquired orbital (ph) you know we talked about you know 10 million or so in revenue for the full year. Yeah I think we still feel comfortable with that like I said in my prepared remarks it's very, very early stage in this market. We're just getting the products in to the hands of partners and it is certainly going to be a ramping story, more toward the back half but you know we're happy with where we are from a product standpoint, we\u2019re making a lot of investment on that front, and I think we have got a great opportunity, frankly in that market space. So you know yes. I\u2019d say on the other question about overall revenue. I mean, we are looking at the products, you know, the way that they are disclosed on the slides that are on our website and also associated with this release. In terms of, you know, license support and services combined, and those are the remarks that I made about the App Networking business growing over 50% was all inclusive. \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nAdam, this is Mark. The thing I would add to the answer that David gave you about WANScaler is that you know every time we introduce a new product in to our channel at summit, we see probably about a two quarter, what I like to call a flat spot, and it's the time that's being taken to authorize and certify technical and selling people in the channels, conduct all the field readiness, et cetera, and we saw that with access gateway at midyear we were behind, and by the end of the year we blew the plan away that we had going in to the year, and it's because it takes some time for us to, you know, get in to the sales cycle and in to the rhythm of our partners. We have also only authorized about 120, and that's growing all the time. I spent some time in the Pacific last quarter, and saw tremendous interest there in getting on board, and learning and being authorized on WANScaler. \nWe also have some fantastic new product releases coming to enhance the product, some of the areas that we know we have been a little bit behind in for certain types of applications, so we're excited and that, and that will be a building process, and then of course the work we're doing with Microsoft. Last Friday, I got an in-depth briefing and demonstration of the WANScaler product running on the Microsoft platform. Very impressive, and very bullish about what I saw there. So it will be a building kind of year for WANScaler, and I think we'll see you know, a good second half with the product. \nAdam Holt - J.P. Morgan Securities\nAnd if I could just a quick follow-up on the buyback, it sounds like we're getting close to resolution on the options review, presumably that would mean then that you will be in the market with a buyback once you get resolution. \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah we will back in the market at that point of time. Right now we have about 300 million or so remaining under the current authorization, and you know would expect to you know resume our normal program once the window opens up. \nAdam Holt - J.P. Morgan Securities\nGreat. Thanks for the help. \nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. \nPhil Winslow - Credit Suisse\nHi, guys, good quarter. This may have been answered in your remarks, but I got cut off from the call, but could you just comment on the ASP trends and just obvious with the May 15 date coming with you know the price increases, and just sort of what the early feedback has been from the other channel partners and customers, but also in just because of raising prices but the additional functionality that you all have put in to the enterprise edition and platinum in particular? \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nPhil, this is Mark, so for Q1 we really didn't see any material change in the mix or ASPs, for presentation server and the key thing to note there is something that David mentioned in his comments, and that is PS 4.5 in the new configuration with platinum enterprise and advance, was only available the last three weeks of the quarter. Which on one hand makes it pretty impressive that platinum accounted for 4% of the (indiscernible) revenue, but at the same time, you know, we haven't seen, haven't had enough of runway to have it impact ASPs and to really measure the kind of mix changes we will actually see. \nIf you look at the pipeline and all of the anecdotal data, its very encouraging, seeing, you know, customers that were buying standard will buy advanced. Customers that were buying advanced will be much more interested in stepping up to enterprise. And then many customers that were buying enterprise were really buying enterprise because they wanted, quote, \u201cto own our most powerful application Virtualization product.\u201d Now that product is platinum edition and, so we're optimistic about those same customers as they come around another buying cycle, either to update or upgrade their systems will actually step up, you know, to the platinum edition. So I think we're going to see this play out. We'll certainly get a great indication this quarter, and we'll see that play out over the next two and three quarters, because some of these cycles especially for platinum are longer because it's a much more you know robust solution. \nPhil Winslow - Credit Suisse\nJust one more question. If you do look at the platinum edition what is sort of the most compelling sort of additional feature set that you have put in there? Is Edge Sight starting to resinate and move the needle with customers? \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nThe answer is yes, very much so we saw EdgeSight actually in several cases, notable cases, go from being an EdgeSight, only kind of conversation to a platinum conversation, which, frankly we did not anticipate that kind of uplift from EdgeSight, but the big contribution of EdgeSight is as an added value and a must-have capability for any customer that is going to be serious about App delivery, and want to really know what kind of user experience they are delivering. So that's a big adder to the Platinum edition and then of course platinum inherits all of the enhancements that 4.5 in general bring, especially the streaming capability that we built in to the enterprise edition. So now whether you want to virtualize or stream to deliver a window's application, you know, you can do that with all of the single sign-on access control, secure transmission over the network through SSL, and end user measurement with the platinum edition, so I think that's why everyone is pretty excited about it. I think we had one chart in the deck that really showed almost like, you know, bar, almost like a bar chart of value reading left to right and I would refer you back to that to really get the top line view of what is new. \nPhil Winslow - Credit Suisse\nGreat. All right. Thanks, guys \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nHi Phil. Thanks a lot. \nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Israel Hernandez with Lehman Brothers. \nIsrael Hernandez - Lehman Brothers\nHi, good afternoon. Hi gentlemen and good quarter. Dave, can you comment on the linearity during the quarter? You know what did you see particularly during the months of March there has been some concern raised by IBM and EMT and some others that the U.S. is slowing, wondering what your experience was? And also I don't think you give us in your prepared remarks, but can you talk about the international contribution of the business and how, how do the regions fair? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nSure. Let me talk to the first part. I think the linearity that we saw in the first quarter was, you know, pretty standard for what we have seen in prior periods. I think we actually had a good March. So you know nothing that I would highlight on that point from a geographic standpoint, the Americas you know was really the stand-out region, including North America and Latin America, growing 27% year-over-year. In the media market it was flat from a year-over-year perspective they also had a pretty tough comp last year after posting a great first quarter in 2006. So that growth rate was a little bit slower than normal. The Pacific region grew over 15% year-over-year, and online services, as you know, which is not included in the geographic segments - is growing nearly 50% as I mentioned before. So you know pretty much in line with expectations around the world, and the same for linearity, I would say. \nIsrael Hernandez - Lehman Brothers\nAre you seeing any changes, though, in terms of customer spending intentions at this point or is this just kind of business as usual right now? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nI would say it's business as usual at this point in time. I think that you know as Mark described in his comments in some of the questions, I mean we're seeing a lot of discussions, pretty constructive discussions around platinum and you know higher levels than realistic solutions I think we have in the past. So I think it's very constructive at this point. \nIsrael Hernandez - Lehman Brothers\nGreat. Thank you. \nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert Baird. \nSteve Ashley - Robert W. Baird\nDave, can you talk to maybe what the get-current contribution (indiscernible)? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, get-current, we continue to have another good quarter for get-current across both what we call reinstatement, which are people that have lapsed less than a year and recovery, which really lapsed their subscription for more than a year. I think both of which were up pretty substantially on a year-over-year basis and showed little bit of you know seasonal decline from Q4 to Q1 like we expected. So, you know, all in, those programs and the teams that are driving those are continuing to do a great job. You know, I would refer people back to the slides that we used at our financial analysts stage to really drill into the opportunity set there is out there with you know several million licenses of what we believe are active customers that are not on current subscription right now. So it will continue to be a focus area for us throughout the balance of the year especially as we bring a lot of the newer technologies platinum and various upgrade alternatives to that installed base. \nSteve Ashley - Robert W. Baird\nCould the number have been around that 10 million mark prior to the fourth quarter? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, it was north of that. \nSteve Ashley - Robert W. Baird\nOkay great. And then you also in your prepared remarks you kind of reference recognized some opportunities for increased investment. Is that a change, and did I hear that right and are you spending or investing money in some new places? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nNo, I think that I mean it's a continuation of really the stance and the position we have had for a long time. I mean we're continuing to invest in a long-term focus of the business. We see a lot of growth opportunities not only on the product side to ensure that our products are leaders in their categories, but also on the go-to market side in areas that are really just most effective for each region, whether that's you know incremental feet on the street or new market penetration, etcetera. So I think there are a lot of things that we want to do, and, you know, a lot of things that we're really going to be focused on driving over the balance of the year. \nSteve Ashley - Robert W. Baird\nAnd just lastly is NetScaler gaining any traction outside the United States? Thank you. \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nThe answer is yes, Steve. It's beginning to gain some traction, and it is spotty based upon the depth of field capabilities that we have in certain areas so parts of Europe we're doing really well. Parts of the Pacific we're doing really well and we're doing really well in places in Latin America as a matter of fact. The common theme is wherever we have good technical people in the field that can work with our partners especially in those early transactions to train them, that's where we're seeing traction, and then especially in enterprise kinds of customers in those regions as well. Again, enterprise overall had a great quarter, but especially in international markets, we saw great traction there. \nSteve Ashley - Robert W. Baird\nThank you. \nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank. \nTodd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities\nHi, guys, nice quarter. \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Todd. \nTodd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities\nTwo questions for you, back to Sarah's question on kind of the core growth rate in the presentation service side of the business. With the price increase kicking in, in the back half of the year, you know, if you still think this is a low single-digit grower, it almost you know, infer that on a unit basis you could be down year-over-year on units. Just kind of walk us through how you are thinking units versus pricing as we think about this six to 12 months out (ph). \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nWell Todd, I'll take it and then maybe David will jump on it. So I think you know what, we're answering the question this way, frankly, because we don't have any data yet to point to in terms of actuals. And then secondly, we don't know what the sales cycles will, in fact be when it comes to platinum and in terms of converting all of the love that we're seeing right now in to cash. Okay? So I think that's you know, giving us, sort of a two responses to you. First, it's to on the upside be cautious and secondly to feel confident about this sort of single, mid-single-digit sort of growth rate that we think the licenses can perform at over a sustained period of time. So that's what you are hearing from us. I think as we get more direct experience and actuals, we'll be able to comment a little bit more clearly on that, but it's just you know hear we are, we are barely now six weeks in to the availability of the products. We're coming up on the end of sale of axis suit in 4.0 and so forth, May 15th, so, you know, there are a lot of moving parts here, and we just want to be a little caution about it. \nTodd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities\nOkay. And Mark you commented on kind of Microsoft and your partnerships. Can you dive in you around long horn server, I believe Data two is shipping what do you guys see in terms of functional improvement from Microsoft per se and how do you think your value proposition changes as long horn server shifts? \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nWell, so without sort of getting overly (indiscernible) about it, we do have some good internal, you know kind of white papers and all that we have made available to partners, etc. We certainly can make them available to you on long horn. But the strategy is pretty simple well first of all, long horn brings a whole bunch of technologies forward that improve the performance and scalability of window's server, and a better window's server means a better presentation server, a better desktop server, et cetera. Secondly, we have done a lot already that you see coming out in 4.5 and then the next couple of releases of presentation server that continue to move presentation server up market toward the premium segments. Microsoft always gets the sort of entry-level segments with their basic system, and we acknowledge that, and we have never stood in the way of that, and we have, so we have worked closely with them to find value-add opportunities. \nSo you'll see us doing much more to allow more graphical types of the applications to be virtualized. Some of that is in 4.5. You'll see more of that in the next release. We're doing a lot more in the manageability area making plugging in to Microsoft's management infrastructure, but also doing a lot more to instrument presentation server, and make that information visible to some of our own products and some of our partner's products. We'll do a lot more in making the infrastructure simpler to manage on a larger scale. Some of the intelligence that we're putting in to load management, and the intelligence we're putting in to the system around self healing it is these kinds of thing that make a difference to you know kind of the medium to global size enterprise that, we think that we're, you know, really focused on serving and that Microsoft, I think, you know, believes we're a great partner in. So that's the way to think about it. \nTodd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities\nOkay. Last question for you, Citrix online has been an absolute home run of an acquisition. But give that run as an independent entity within you guys, would you ever think of spinning that out or selling it? \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nNot at this time. We think they are contributing, greatly to the company financially, but also strategically. As you see the first evidence of significant evidence of that when we release Project Kent in the back half of the year with IBM as our GoTo market partner. The GoToMyPC infrastructure is a key piece of the system. The entire system is built as a service and a lot of, so you'll get a sense for that. As we go further, you'll see us have a great opportunity to integrate application sharing into some of the other products that we have, and on demand assistance in to other products we have, so, you know, that's what is to expect. \nTodd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities\nOkay. Thanks, guys. \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Todd. \nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with Merrill Lynch. \nEd Maguire - Merrill Lynch\nYes, good afternoon, a question for Dave. I mean, I know you are hampered by the amount of detail you can give us around OpEx, but did the operating expenses during the quarter end up higher or lower than you had initially anticipated? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nInteresting question, you know, beyond it is, it is unfortunate one of those areas where I can't just drill in to a whole lot right now. Simply because you got to start with a GAAP number and work backwards from there. And you know really the only (indiscernible) that I can give on expenses is what you see in the press release, in my prepared remarks, but the one thing I would call out is say the expenses associated with the option review, as I mentioned earlier, were obviously substantially higher than we had thought, coming in at about $6 million for the quarter. So you know we certainly missed that one. \nEd Maguire - Merrill Lynch\nOkay. Moving on to deal sizes, if you could talk about the average deal sizes that you saw in the quarter in your top 10 deals and also, I know you have got some incentives to encourage cross-selling across the different product lines. Could you just speak to how successful your initiatives there have been so far this quarter? \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nLet me take the second one first, Ed. So the cross-selling and the incentives we put in place, I think you are talking about the jump and the span bonus programs, and, you know, some of the products that are eligible under that program shift late in the quarter, in the last month of the quarter. So it's a, we're encouraged, you know, those expenses come out of contra, so they are in the revenue numbers that David did talk about, and they were up in a good way as a result of our partners taking advantage of both span and jump. We'll have a better read on that this quarter; obviously, when we have a, pretty much a full quarter where all of the projects that are eligible specifically platinum edition, specifically NetScaler, WANScaler, and access gateway enterprise edition and EdgeSight, excuse me are all eligible for this bonus program. \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah and I would just add on the deal size, nothing terribly unique this quarter. We had a couple of individual transactions over $1 million. We had a number of other transactions between about a $ half million and $1 million. From a geo split, I would say half of those were in the North American markets half of those were in the media markets. And you know specific to NetScaler in the networking working group. We had three customers that in the aggregate were over $1 million in total purchases but not against a single transaction. Two of those three were in the traditional, you know, media metric space, and one of them I would classify in telecom infrastructure. \nEd Maguire - Merrill Lynch\nOkay. Thanks. \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nPretty consistent across the board, you know, as I did mention earlier, we're seeing a higher and higher percentage of the App networking transaction coming from what we would consider to be you know traditional enterprise customers. You know, certainly along the expectation as we train up more of our partners get the product out there in to the hands of our existing customers and sales organizations. \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nEd, I would add to that that, you know, these are the kind of metrics we actually like to see to not be overly dependent on kind of seven figure deals and big deals in any quarter. And when we look at the trends around what are we selling to existing customers, either cross-selling or where we're selling licenses for new projects versus a new customer or a brand new project. You know, it still runs about 2/3rds of our revenue comes from, you know, a customer that knows us, that we know them, and, you know, they\u2019re maybe not, they are not huge transactions, maybe up to $800,000, and there's more of a flow to that business within the new customer sort of part of the business, still runs around 1/3 of revenue. \nOperator\nYour next question comes from Dino Diana from UBS. \nDino Diana - UBS Investment Research\nHi, sorry about that. With regard to operating margins, if we back out the amortization and the write-off and the 6 million legal fees we get to about 24.6. If you follow the same guidance that your guidance about 25% 2-Q (ph) and my question is one is that math, right? And two, what does it mean for your former operating margin guidance of mid-to high 20 range? Is it really you know I guess should we read that it's more concentrated at the low end of that range for full year? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nWell, just a coupe couple of things, one like I said a couple of times I am just not really not at liberty to dig in to a lot of the financial line items that I normally am given the ongoing to review, and until there's a GAAP number you know we just can't go in to a lot of detail. But I say at the highest level we're not changing our stance that we have had for a long time. On the way we are operating and running the business. You know our forward outlook, even beyond 2007 continues to be, mid-to upper quartile operating margin, which we consider to be in the mid to upper 20% operating margin which we consider to be in the upper quartile of our peer group, and we will balance that with what we consider to be also significantly above-average growth and investing for the long term. So you know, I can't help you can your math this quarter, just based on the limitations, but you know I hope that helps. \nDino Diana - UBS Investment Research\nOkay. I guess from a revenue perspective, just one quick clarification on Ardence is that included in that App Virtualization segment? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nNo, that's in the other segment. \nDino Diana - UBS Investment Research\nIn the other, okay. Alright. Thanks. \nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Freitas with BMO Capital. \nSteve Freitas - BMO Capital Markets\nHi, good afternoon. Nicely done this quarter. \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Steve. \nSteve Freitas - BMO Capital Markets\nThis may not be a fair question, but I'm just curious as you look at a year or two years, what do you think will be a larger business, will it be the application networking group or the software as a service group, the online property? \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nTwo very different types of businesses in terms of how the revenue, you know, the type of revenue streams they are. I think, sort of in scale, people growth rates, etc., I think it's a horse race, you know, and both of them are addressing very high growth rate, sort of primary markets that are Greenfield, and I think that we have sort of market-leading technologies to go after those Greenfield opportunities and I think in both cases. So I'm not sure I could answer you better than that, Steve. \nSteve Freitas - BMO Capital Markets\nOkay. I guess secondly, if you listen to a lot of the other WAN optimization vendors in the space they make a lot of noise regarding some of the client software innovations that they either are shipping or planning, and from what I recall WANScaler has a similar client software. I just wondering how important you think that piece of technology is going to be and if there's any, you know, bundling advantages that you have relative to your competitors given that you also sell SSL VPN which has a client component and you know the obvious bundling opportunities and pricing opportunities there? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nYes, we have had alpha versions of our client out shown to customers, and you know it's great technology and we'll be one of those and one of the first to offer something to customers in the market that's real. I'd say this, that in the whole scheme of things in WAN optimization, I think we should expect this type of solution to make a difference you know sometime down the road that right now the opportunities around sort of mesh-type configurations, point-to-point configurations, tying in branch offices, etc. And the client actually is more for the, quote, Micro branch (ph). \nSomeone who is working at home and we do have some advantages there, because we will be able to bake some of that technology in to some of our other client software that is widely distributed, either through our App virtualization businesses, or our SSL VPN business, and so forth. So, but, you know, we haven't., we're not sort of thumping our chest about these kinds of things, we're, you know, going step by step after the meat and potato's of the marketplace that I mentioned and we have got some great innovations coming, and then we're pretty confident in what we're doing with Microsoft, in that, we believe that tremendous number of customers would prefer to have a window's-based device in the branch that has the broad set of services ranging from DHCP, DNS and so forth that work very nicely and managed in conjunction with the WAN optimization capabilities that you are putting there \nAnd then, you know, tying that in to either windows or non-windows kind of head-in device in the data center that sits in front of, directly in front of you know either windows or web Apps, and I think we have some advantages there. So you know we're going to take this step by step, and, you know, we have got a game plan, and we think it will take, you know, four to six quarters to really play out significantly, and, you know, we're doing it patiently, and step by step. \nSteve Freitas - BMO Capital Markets\nThanks a lot. \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nWe're great About it. \nOperator\nYour next question comes from Kirk Materne with Banc of America Securities. \nKirk Materne \u2013 Banc of America Securities\nThanks very much. Dave, understanding you are somewhat handcuffed in what you can say on the expense side, but if I look at what's you guys did this quarter and then look at the expense guidance for the second quarter and then the full year, is it fair to say the investments are going to be somewhat front-end loaded this year? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think the investment profile for the year is you know pretty consistent with the way we have looked at it in the past. I mean we certainly aren't trying to necessarily put investments in a specific quarter. You know there's kind of an operational reality about the investments we are making in the business, our ability to consume, if you will, and, you know, we'll be investing throughout the year, because we really are focused on a multi-year view of this business not simply optimizing quarter to quarter. The only unique thing in the two quarters was the stock option review, costs, all of the accounting and legal fees, which are, you know, 6 million in Q1 in the actuals, and a forecast for 3 million in the second quarter, which, you know we will obviously we'll go in to in more granularity upon the Q2 call just given that it is a forecast at this point. \n Kirk Materne \u2013 Banc of America Securities \n(Indiscernible) I won't pursue that any further I guess. And then Mark, can you just give me some idea were NetScaler 8.0 is getting released what sort of your expectations for that product in terms that how long it's going to take to hit its stride? Obvious you guys had a good quarter with NetScaler up sequentially but you know with NetScaler 8.0 where shall we really see a release or of it firing on all cylinders in terms of getting into the channel and getting customers comfortable with it. \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I think, you know we don't expect to see step functions in this kind of thing, because remember our customers are on maintenance, and we'll tend to, you know, update them in place, but the new capabilities, obviously open up new opportunities, and that's all dependent upon the training the field readiness, et cetera that we're doing around the App expert area. Obviously really helps a lot, especially when you are going to market through partners and want partners to be able to go in and really set this up well for a customer, and really take the load off the network architect, et cetera and set up policies and rules. So I would say that, you know, we'll start to see some real impact, probably, you know, later in Q3 as we get the training in place and get a sales cycle going, and obviously we have got the summer season in between. \n Kirk Materne \u2013 Banc of America Securities \nOkay. That's it for me. Thanks. \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Kirk. \nOperator\nYour next question comes from Rob Owens with Pacific-Crest Securities. \nRob Owens - Pacific-Crest Securities\nYeah, good afternoon, well I want to focus a little bit on the NetScaler side of the business. You mentioned that you were seeing more enterprise customers there. Can you discuss how that mix has changed quarter over quarter and are you seeing anything new on the competitive front or win rates on either side of the business, the enterprise or the dot-com. \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nLet's see, Rob, how can I answer you? Well first on the internet centric business we're still you know pretty much winning 100% of the deals that we are in there, and, you know, that, that's been sort of the hallmark of NetScaler for a long, long time, and we really understand the needs of internet centric customers. We have been building now for a few quarters, this momentum in terms of partners, and in terms of the kind of product features you need go to market through partners to the enterprise, and that's included, you know, kind of lower end appliances, for more entry-level type systems, the ease of use capabilities you see in 8.0, and then the additional authorizations of partners and we see that we're up nicely in Q1 in terms of partner authorizations. So that has lead to actually a much higher transaction rate in the enterprise business, and that's growing nicely. Again, the transactions aren't too, six-figure transactions, they are going to be many sort of under $100,000 deals. \nBut we like that, that's the kind of business that we like, especially when you have a larger scale partner network. Hoping to continue to grow the partner network not only in North America but outside the U.S, and I think I mentioned a little earlier we were, I spent two weeks over in Asia, actually in China in the quarter, and we actually held in the Pacific a two-day training event we called partner accelerator, and over the course we had it in six cities. The final one was in Beijing. We had 300 people come to the Beijing event, spend two days, tremendous interest if you look at the attendants in the sessions on NetScaler and WANScaler, and we saw, we actually trained over 1200 people in the Pacific alone in our partner network across all of the, all six strategic products in the quarter. So we're kind of this machine right? Especially when you get outside the U.S. we're the territories are a little more dispersed. \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nI would add one comment to that, Rob, just specific to the numbers and the trend I think you were asking about I think it's fair to say that now we're running about 50/50 in terms of enterprise versus more traditional media metrics customers when it comes to revenue. Certainly on a new customer basis, the majority of them are, you know, more traditional enterprise-type customers. A year ago and I would say that the mix was probably 75% media metrics 25% enterprise, so that we certainly trend in that direction really consistent with the way that we have been talking about the growth of the business for sometime. \nRob Owens - Pacific-Crest Securities\nGreat. And the other question across those two verticals any sense of your win rate improving? \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nAcross the two\u2026 \nRob Owens - Pacific-Crest Securities\nInternet and NetScaler (Indiscernible) \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nIt's hard to get better than 100% in the internet centric market, and then the win rates in enterprise are obviously improving, because, you know, we're seeing good growth there, so, you know, we're happy with both of them, and we're especially happy with the leverage we're getting in the GoToMarket with partners. I mean, I think that's super important to understand our game plan here. Not only in terms of the ramp but also you know the kind of features that we are adding to the products the kind of GoToMarket programs we're implementing in the you know the advisor reward bonus program, you know all of that kind of comes together and builds momentum over time. So that's the answer to your question. \nRob Owens - Pacific-Crest Securities\nGreat. Thanks. \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nOperator, I think we have time for one last call. \nOperator\nYour next question comes from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies & Co. \nKatherine Egbert - Jefferies & Co\nHi, this is Katherine Egbert, Jefferies. Just a quick question, Dave can you quantify the impact of the end of life of XP, the end of maintenance from 3.0 4.0 and then the end of service on access suite that all come up in the next quarter? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nNot really. I think that you know it's not a specific number when we look forward. You know, the major event is you know really the end of sale of XP. That was the big one if you look back a year ago and we saw the mayor impact across you know the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006, and you know we have talked about that a long time. I wouldn't expect any material impact from just the end of maintenance or end of support. I think it's just one of those additional incentives for customers to migrate to the more recent platforms to get current, to get that type of support, but I wouldn't look at it as a stair step, just other incremental positives. \nKatherine Egbert - Jefferies & Co\nWhat about the end of sale of the access suite in May? \nDavid Henshall - Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think that's not a big deal simply because current access suite customers will be able to participate with the platinum version, so we're actually going to be giving that to them. If they are on current subscription, so we look at it as a real positive for those customers to be able to get those incremental new products for what they have been paying against subscription for the access suite. \nKatherine Egbert - Jefferies & Co\nOkay. That's helpful. Thanks. \nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions and answers. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. \nMark Templeton - President, Chief Executive Officer\nOnce again, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing you in three months and reporting to you on our Q2 results.

My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nEd Lockwood\nThank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWe\u2019re here today to discuss first quarter results for the period ended December 30, 2014. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific time. If you haven\u2019t seen the release, you can find it on our Web site at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our Web site.\nThere, you\u2019ll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor\u2019s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2014, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you\u2019ll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.\nAs you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we\u2019d make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. These forward-looking statements, including references to the future financial performance and condition of the company, future macroeconomic and industry condition, future growth, any anticipated drivers of such growth, the company\u2019s future capital structure, our leverage, recapitalization, a special cash dividend, incremental debt, plans to reduce debt, uses of cash, plans to purchase shares and levels of stockholder return, potential market and revenue opportunities and trends in the semiconductor industry and the anticipated challenges associated with them are based on the company\u2019s estimates, assumptions and expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\nMore information regarding factors that can cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, including our fiscal year 2014 Form 10-K and our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 8-K and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web.\nWith that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rick.\nRichard Wallace\n\nThanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in our earnings call. Today, I\u2019ll discuss our refinancing and recapitalization announcement and the business highlights of the first quarter. Bren will then review the financial details of today\u2019s announcements followed by Q&A.\nToday, as part of our ongoing activities focused on returning value to shareholders, KLA-Tencor is announcing our intention to recapitalize our balance sheet. These actions reflect management and the Board of Directors\u2019 confidence in our market leadership, business model and long-term growth strategies, as well as our leadership and strong commitment to delivering a high level of returns to stockholders.\nBren will have more details of the transaction, but in summary, what we\u2019re announcing today is proposed leverage recapitalization of KLA-Tencor, which would return approximately $4 billion to our stockholders. Subject to closing of the financial aspect of this initiative, we intend to issue a $16.50 per share special dividend.\nWe\u2019re also announcing that our Board of Directors has authorized an increase to the company\u2019s stock repurchase program by an additional 3.0 million shares of common stock. This increasing value add approximately $250 million based upon the closing cost of our common stock as of October 20, 2014.\nWe believe our capital structure strategy underscores our confidence and the strength of our strategic objectives in our business model, but also the strength of our balance sheet. As we\u2019ve invested in our business and executed our growth strategies over time, we have experienced strong cash generation in excess of what believe is necessary to fund our operations and investing our future growth. We intend to continue to execute our business model and strategies, manage our company profitability and provide a high level of value to our stockholders.\nTurning now to highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2015; September quarter revenue and earnings per share results finished as expected. The new orders in Q1 ended below the guided range at $567 million, as orders from one of our foundry market customers ended below the original forecast for the quarter.\nWe believe this is due to two factors. First, there are many challenges associated with adopting the new technologies required to fabricate leading-edge transistor architectures. Second, tighter order lead times have become the norm in our industry today. And this coupled with a concentrated customer base is resulting in increased quarterly order variability.\nWe currently expect a rebound in foundry order levels in the December quarter as customers move closer to the implementation of new capacity additions in leading-edge foundries that are expected to begin in the first half of calendar 2015.\nAlthough the September quarter bookings profile reflects an unusually low level activity from one of our foundry market customers in terms of next-generation FinFET build out, it\u2019s clear that the battlefield for sub 20-nanometer competition has been formed with many players positioning to meet next-generation production ramp schedules.\nRecall the near record level of foundry orders booked by KLA-Tencorp in the single customer in the June quarter, with delivery dates for these orders slated for early 2015. These orders combined with a strong foundry order forecast for KLA-Tencor in the current quarter indicate the more aggressive pace of investment in FinFET capacity has begun.\nFinFET processes are extremely complex and challenging to bring to market. Our customers rely on KLA-Tencor to help address the ongoing yield issues associated with these new technologies.\nLogic orders came in largely as expected in the September quarter. Memory orders grew sequentially in the September quarter, with roughly a 50-50 split between DRAM and NAND Flash. DRAM customers are continuing their investments in 2x nanometer technology conversions. In addition to new capacity activity, the Flash demand continues to be focused on planar NAND.\nFor KLA-Tencor, our market leadership and growth are driven through successful collaboration with our customers. Our mission is to help our customers navigate the ever-changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition.\nTurning now to our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the December quarter booking profile represents a meaningful pick up in order activity, largely driven by the leading-edge foundries as they move to prepare FinFET production capacity ahead of anticipated end customer demand in 2015.\nWe expect December order quarter bookings to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million, up approximately 40% at the midpoint from September. Guidance for revenue in the December quarter is in the range of $620 million to $700 million, and non GAAP earnings per share is projected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.70 in the quarter.\nDecember quarter EPS guidance does not consider the impact on other income and expense and tax rate related to the proposed recapitalization transaction. However, upon completion of the proposed transaction later in the quarter, we plan to update guidance to reflect the earnings impact of the proposed transaction.\nSo, to wrap it up, KLA-Tencor is acknowledged as a the market leader in process control with a proven track record of consistently delivering industry-leading revenue growth, profitability and strong cash flow generation. KLA-Tencor\u2019s strong business model and the ongoing successful execution of our strategic plans enable us to continue to invest in our business at a high level to fuel our growth and support our customer\u2019s needs. We\u2019re also delivering meaningful returns to stockholders as exemplified by today\u2019s announcements.\nToday, the factors driving our growth in market leadership remain favorable. We\u2019re confident in KLA-Tencor\u2019s ability to drive innovation and help customers addressing the increasing cost and complexity of computing at the leading-edge.\nI\u2019ll now turn it over to Bren for more details on today\u2019s announcement and his perspective on the quarter.\nBren Higgins\nThanks, Rick. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Today, we\u2019re very pleased to announce new dimensions to our capital allocation strategy. To support our ongoing commitments to return capital to stockholders, we plan to pursue a $4 billion leverage recapitalization featuring a $16.50 per share special cash dividend with an aggregate value of approximately 2.75 billion.\nThe special cash dividend would be an addition to our regular $0.50 per share quarterly dividend. The intended special cash dividend will be funded in part with the portion of cash on the company\u2019s balance sheet and in part with 2.5 billion incremental debt that will be added to the balance sheet. Our regular $0.50 per share quarterly cash dividend is expected to be declared and paid following our regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting in November 2014.\nIn addition to the $16.50 per share special dividend, our Board of Directors has also approved an additional authorization of 3.6 million shares for our stock repurchase program, representing an additional $250 million increase over the $1 billion originally authorized in July. We expect to complete the new share repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months.\nIncluding the special cash dividend with an aggregate value of approximately $2.75 billion, the $250 million increase to the stock repurchase program announced today and the $1 billion stock repurchase program previously announced in July 2014, the total capitals will be directed to stockholders will be approximately $4 billion in aggregate. The aggregate value of the special dividend of approximately $2.75 billion includes the portion of the special cash dividend that could be payable to holders of outstanding equity award under the company\u2019s 2004 equity incentive plan.\nThis leverage recapitalization will add a more permanent tier of debt with longer maturity dates in our current nodes, thereby improving the efficiency of our balance sheet. As part of our recapitalization, we intend to issue incremental debt consisting of a pre-payable term loan facility which we intend to de-lever over the next three to five years and investment grade senior notes with staggered maturities.\nWe also expect to enter into revolving credit facility. An unprecedented lending environment coupled with what we expect to be a robust capital spending profile in our industry over the next few years has enabled us to undertake this program and borrow above our long run debt target of 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA leverage to opportunistically optimize the company\u2019s capital structure and enhance total stockholder returns over our base plan.\nWe intend to maintain an investment grade rating. As Rick mentioned, our strategic positive remains strong, and we\u2019re delivering superior cash flows and financial results. We entered the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 with over $2.9 billion of cash and investments with roughly two thirds of our through cycle cash flow generated in the U.S.\nAs we look ahead, the near-term priorities for domestic cash include about $500 million of cash to fund operations on an ongoing basis. We\u2019ll continue to execute the same strategies that have enabled us to sustain our market leadership and process control, deliver long-term revenue growth in excess of the market and deliver superior profitability and cash flows. As part of these market leadership and growth strategies, we\u2019re committed to continuing to invest at high levels in research and development and evaluating perspective strategic growth opportunities that are complementary to our model.\nThis is the formula for success that has served us well over the years in extending our market leadership, dealing strong cash flows and establishing KLA-Tencor among the leaders in returning value to stockholders.\nOur strategies for growth are driven by goal to deliver better than industry average revenue across the multiyear cycle and earnings growth targeted at 1.5 to 2 times revenue growth over time. We believe today\u2019s news reflects our confidence in the prospects for continued successful execution of these strategies.\nAs we execute on these long-term growth strategies, we plan to deliver returns to stockholders via dividends, through stock repurchases and by reinvesting in the business and ways to deliver sustainable value. We see today\u2019s announcement as the next logical step in our ongoing efforts to drive stockholder value.\nTurning now to more specifics on the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015; I\u2019ll provide summary highlight in my commentary on the call today, please refer to the supplemental materials we had posted in the Investor Relations page in our Web site for additional detail on the financial results for the quarter.\nRevenue for Q1 was $643 million, above the midpoint of guidance, and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.43. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter above midpoint of the guided range at $0.47 per share. Non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.50 per share at our guided tax rate of 22%.\nIn our press release and in our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you\u2019ll find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.04 difference in EPS. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in today\u2019s press release.\nNew orders in Q1 were 567 million, below the guided bookings range for the quarter of 600 million to 800 million, as orders from one of our foundry market customers originally scheduled to be placed in the September quarter were pushed out. As Rick noted, we believe the delay in orders from this customer for FinFET ramp is partially a timing issue with this customer providing shorter lead times from order placement to shipment than we\u2019ve seen in the past.\nCalendar 2015 is expected to be a year of growth for the semiconductor equipment industry with multiple customers simultaneously ramping new leading-edge capacity and foundry, logic and memory in the year. With that said, we continue to experience low order visibility with a limited number of customers placing sizeable orders comprising the majority of our forecast. And as these plans change, driven by yield issues or lead time commitments, the impact on quarterly forecast accuracy is significant.\nTurning now to our customer segment commentary for the September quarter; foundry was 25% of new orders in Q1, and very low compared with recent history. In fact, orders from one of our foundry market leaders finished over $100 million below the original forecast, ending the unexpected low levels in Q1. Foundry demand is expected to rebound to 62% of orders in the December quarter. As Rick noted, the competitive battleground in next- generation foundry is taking shape. Incapacity plans for FinFET are lining up for the first half of calendar 2015.\nAs the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to benefit from what we expect to be a strong broad based foundry demand for 16 and 14 nanometer nodes. Memory was 46% of new system orders in September, up sequentially both in terms of percentage of total orders and absolute dollars compared to June. Logic was 28% of new orders in September above the original forecast for the quarter. Customer investments in technology of 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 66% of the orders we received in Q1.\nTurning now to the distribution of orders by product group; wafer inspection was approximately 49%, reticle inspection was approximately 3%, metrology was 15%, service was approximately 30%, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was 3%. Total shipments in Q1 were 548 million and below the bottom end of the guided range of 600 million to 650 million as delivery timing for certain orders related the leading- edge foundry projects, originally expected to ship in the September quarter, shipped it into Q2 in early 2015.\nThis is consistent with the conditions we experienced in the March and June quarters. The shipment delivery dates for tools currently in backlog are featuring extended lead times, resulting in a lower quarterly shipment profile over the near-term. We expect shipments in Q2 to grow approximately 40% sequentially at the midpoint of December guidance. We entered the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of total backlog comprised of $993 million of shipment backlog or orders that had not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six to nine months.\nOur current shipment backlog is at historic high levels for the company, providing the baseline for strong shipment and revenue growth as we convert this backlog in the coming quarters; $173 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced, but had not yet have been find out by customers.\nTurning to the income statement; the numbers show KLA-Tencor executed well operationally in the September quarter with revenue, gross margin, and EPS, all finishing in the upper end of the range of guidance. As I previously mentioned, revenue in September were 643 million, just about the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter. Gross margin was 55.6%; 100 basis points above the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter, in spite of the $91 million sequential decline in revenue.\nGross margin exceeded our expectations in the quarter due to lower than forecasted parts cost in our service business and a favorable product mix in Q1. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 56% to 57% in December. Total operating expenses in the September quarter were 240 million, up sequentially about nine million compared with June, mainly due to higher employee-related cost in the quarter. Consistent with our expectations, prototype material costs for certain next-generation products are expected to be higher in the first half of our fiscal year versus the second half. But the December quarter, we are modeling operating expenses to be between $236 million and $238 million.\nOther income and expense was approximately $10 million in September, prior to the recapitalization, our expectation at OIE will be about 10 million in the December quarter. However, given the unknown currently surrounding the structure and timing of the proposed recapitalization, at this time we\u2019re unable to guide OIE for the December quarter. We plan to provide detailed guidance update some time later this quarter to reflect the impact of the transaction on OIE tax rate earnings per share.\nOur effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter, above our long-term planning rate of about 22%. We believe the appropriate long-term planning rate should be 22%, given our expectations for the mix of business over the next few years. The 22% planning rate also assumes reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit that expired at the end of calendar year 2013.\nGiven the low probability that this extension will occur in the December quarter, we are modeling a tax rate of 24% for the December quarter. Finally, net income for Q1 was 79 million or $0.47 per fully diluted share.\nI\u2019ll turn now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statements. Cash and investments ended the quarter at 2.94 billion, a decrease of 210 million compared with June. Sequential decline in our cash balances is largely due to staff repurchases and annual bonus payments in the quarter. Cash from operations was $35 million in the quarter. The sequential declining cash flow from operations in Q1 is consistent with seasonal trends and was driven in part by lower revenue levels as well as the timing of our annual bonus compensation payments in the quarter.\nIn the September quarter, we paid $82 million in dividends and repurchased 125 million of our common stock. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just under a 156 million. So with that, to reiterate our guidance for the December quarter is, bookings are expected to be within a range of 700 million to 900 million, shipment guidance for the December quarter in a range of 740 to 800 million, revenue between 620 and 700 million, and EPS of $0.46 to $0.70 per share, exclusive of the impact of the recapitalization.\nOnce again, we plan to provide an update in the December quarter guidance that will reflect the impact of the proposed recapitalization concurrent with the currently scheduled closing of the transaction later this quarter.\nThis concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.\nEd Lockwood\nOkay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we\u2019d like to open up the call to questions and we once again request that you limit yourself to one question in one follow-up, given the limited time we have for today\u2019s call. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we\u2019ll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. So, Mike, we\u2019re ready for your first question.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) The first question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\nFarhan Rizvi \u2013 Credit Suisse\nHi, thanks for taking the question. This is Farhan asking the question on behalf of John. Rick, can you just talk about briefly like why you chose to do a special dividend instead of buybacks, and what were the puts and takes in making the decision?\nRichard Wallace\nHi. Well, I\u2019ll give an overview and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Bren to get the specifics. So look, the way we look at it, there are three uses of cash. And the primary use is to fund our organic growth and we fully satisfy that, and we continue to build upon that. The second is to look for accretive and enabling M&A. And we\u2019ve done those things and continue to evaluate those and we feel we can do them. And then the third one is returning cash to shareholders and in that we look for the most efficient way, an effective way to do that, considering a lot of factors including who our shareholders are. And also the size of the return and what\u2019s most efficient. And so, from that I\u2019ll hand it to Bren.\nBren Higgins\nSo I think anytime you consider a large return to capital, I mean certainly we start from an assessment of our business around how much cash can the business have, what kind of reserves do we need, also, the potential debt capacity of the company. And so as we looked at that and to Rick\u2019s point as we assessed our options, we clearly did not see at least for now, anything on the M&A front that looked as compelling to shareholder value is what we\u2019re doing here today.\nBut given the size of the transaction itself, the practice of trying to execute a share repurchase is difficult. There is a tender offer and the premiums and all those kinds of things, and I think it really comes back to Rick\u2019s point, who are our shareholders, what did they value? We think our shareholders value our dividend practice, our practice of returning cash, the ability to treat all shareholders the same, and the timeliness and efficiency of the execution.\nThere is a piece of this obviously, that is share repurchase that we will execute over time. We made the previous announcement back in July, up a billion dollars that which was executed a 125 million and we added another 250 to that. So we will be executing that over time as another component. There are I think different opinions on what\u2019s the best approach. I think it goes back to how we think about our business. How much cash do we need and ultimately we made the call to do it this way where we feel like we\u2019re optimizing between the two vehicles.\nFarhan Rizvi \u2013 Credit Suisse\nThank you. And just one question in terms of the calendar first half of next year, what kind of pick up are you expecting in the first half of next year?\nRichard Wallace\nWell, as you know, we don\u2019t guide beyond the next quarter, but overall for calendar 2015, I think it is setting up nicely for heavily investment in FinFET across the board. And when we look at our foundry customers, really nobody is shipping products today on a large volume with FinFET devices. And I think by the end of calendar 2015, the expectation is there\u2019ll be multiple devices from multiple suppliers of FinFET technology. So that bodes well for investment.\nSo what we\u2019re anticipating, as we said for the December quarter is a pickup in investment associated with that. But then throughout 2015, the way the plans look and the way our customers are talking to us about it, I think we\u2019ll see multiple players supporting that ramp.\nBren Higgins\nYes, I think the only thing I would add to that is given the timing of the second half of the year to be delivering product, it does make sense that you start to see capacity ramping in the first half of the year. Certainly, we are driving our supply chain in building towards that expectation. And I think it lines up with the end market dynamics that Rick mentioned.\nFarhan Rizvi \u2013 Credit Suisse\nThank you. That\u2019s all I have.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.\nTimothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen\nThanks a lot guys. Two things; first of all, Rick, I\u2019m curious if you can talk about the FinFET timing issues and if it\u2019s possible to segment it out whether it\u2019s process-related or some of it is like customer-related IE, like your customers, a lot of obvious uncertainty out there. And so I\u2019m wondering whether you could segment the two, and then I had a follow-up. Thanks.\nRichard Wallace\nSure. From what we understand in talking to our customers, I think there is a desire by the end customers to get to the technology, but there is an inability right now in general to have a large scale deployment of technologies that are reliable enough to be deployed in high volume. So I think that that\u2019s really limiting. Like I said, we expect the first commercial devices to come out, consumer devices to come out by the end of the calendar year within that technology. But that\u2019s really only from one supplier.\nThe other ones are working through a number of issues and there are associated challenges with defect density but also structural reliability. And I think that for people that haven\u2019t done FinFET, it\u2019s turning out to be a very challenging process. So I think there is a lot of effort going on to deal with that. As you know there has been some success in 20-nanometer. So given that that\u2019s made it into the current product cycle, we\u2019re really talking about a next product cycle which I think is as soon as we expect to see volume, is mid calendar year of 2015.\nSo, as I said, we expect investment to be ramping in dealing with some of those challenges. But the people that are in front on FinFET struggle quite a bit getting yield on them and we were involved and work you through some of those challenges. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be easy. And I think that on the one hand we\u2019re enabling that but on the other hand, until it starts to work there\u2019s not going to be a lot of customer demands, not a lot to tape out. But then I expect to see an avalanche of demand once the process start working.\nTimothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen\nOkay. Thanks for that. And then I guess, just a follow-up to the prior question about the decision to pay a special dividend. Why would you decide to do that when you\u2019re about to put up a quarter that where the guidance is definitely disappointing relative to what Street was thinking and you could have maybe bought stock back at a much, much lower price. I guess I\u2019m just wondering that calculus around paying that special dividend versus maybe doing an ASR post these results, something like that. Thanks.\nRichard Wallace\nSure. Well, as you can imagine, this is Rick, I\u2019ll start with an overview and then let Bren fill it in. First of all, this wasn\u2019t a decision that was something about a near-term decision, that is a long-term decision around the capital structure of the company, something that they\u2019re working at for quite a while to figure out what is the right way to position the company and structure it. So it\u2019s independent of ups and downs of particularly the quarters and we certainly are market timers.\nSo we look at that, and we say \"What\u2019s the best way, what\u2019s the best capital structure?\" And then, in this case, there is a blend, but it\u2019s obviously greater in the special dividend and it\u2019s the most efficient way to be able to return cash to shareholders. If that was really thinking, it wasn\u2019t meant to be coincident with any particular quarter. It just happened to coincide.\nBren Higgins\nThe other thing I think I\u2019ll add is clearly the ability to finance this was driven by a very attractive debt market both in terms of rates, terms, and financial flexibility. Also, our view on being able to overshoot or go further than our long-term target of 2 to 2.5 times leverage was also driven by our views of capital intensity and healthy capital spending environment over the next couple of years to enable us to de-leverage some of this debt we\u2019re taking on back to our target.\nI\u2019ve been saying, I think for I think even going back to May and even in the SEMICON that we felt like it made sense for our company given the dynamics or secular dynamics or business model, the barriers to entry, our market share that more assertive capital structure would drive additional value to our shareholders. And so, this was a process, we made the share repurchase announcement. At the time, we said that that was the first step; this is the next step.\nSo we talk a lot already about the pros and cons of the vehicle, but at the same time I just want to give you a little bit of insight in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about it.\nTimothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen\nOkay, Bren. Thanks a lot.\nOperator\nThe next question is from C.J. Muse with ISI Group.\nC.J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group\nYes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, if I could \u2013 I\u2019ll try to ask both my questions at once as they\u2019re partially related. I guess, first off, when you consider this special dividend, I\u2019m curious whether you focused it all on the M&A side or increased R&D. When I look at your relative to position to WFE over the last two years, you underperform by about eight points each year. I\u2019d would love to hear your thoughts on whether that was a consideration, and how you\u2019re going to rectify this relative underperformance that is going on at least for the last few years.\nAnd then second part of the question is flexibility. If I look at you guys perform a post-transaction, roughly 20% debt to cap and roughly 2/3rds of your free cash flow will cover interest and dividend. And I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s enough flexibility for what may come for what is still a cyclical industry. Thank you.\nRichard Wallace\nYes. C.J., I\u2019ll take part of it and then again, Bren can look at it. Yes, we can talk about the relative performance. I think as you\u2019re well aware, we have a \u2013 we\u2019re biased towards increased adoption in logic and foundry and less so in memory, although memory is increasing. And what we\u2019ve seen this year clearly is that the memory investment has been higher than maybe anticipated originally and has continued to go up.\nWe expect that trend to reverse a little bit in 2015 where we do see the foundry customers increasing their investment, and in our expectations, memory will probably normally hold to what they\u2019re doing in 2014. So I think the mix becomes favorable for us. So we look at over the long-term.\nThe second part, I look at is a big change in the company and the industry I think has to do with \u2013 while the near-term volatility has increased, the longer term volatility has actually decreased because of the efficiencies associated with consolidation.\nThe other thing that gives us a lot of confidence is in our ability to service the debt and do everything else that we want to do, is a growing service business, which is much more aligned with what\u2019s going on in overall semiconductor manufacturing. And we just looked and we had seven consecutive growth of service business. And so we look at that as a business that can feel and can help dramatically service this debt. Bren, do you want to fill in?\nBren Higgins\nYes, C.J., I think you mentioned operational investment and I think that we have ramped up our investment to support our businesses. We have a product cadence that\u2019s 2XR competitors. So we believe we are investing enough in our business to be able to maintain our market position, and I think that the underperformance that you talk about is more driven by \u2013 it\u2019s the most sensitive element I think, and that is to explain more about customer mix than anything else.\nFrom a flexibility perspective, we are using our offshore cash in this transaction. There is an unfunded revolver that\u2019s a component to it. We also plan to have about 500 million in the U.S. We\u2019re going to execute the share repurchase over time. And certainly there are some elements that provide flexibility there. As you know, covering this industry for a long time, this is not a capital intensive industry, and so, we don\u2019t need a lot of cash to run the business. We have to grow in service business, that\u2019s a bigger percentage of the revenue.\nSo, a much more comfortable, given the cyclical dynamics as well, I think we\u2019re much more comfortable with the risk profile. Then, our intent is to de-lever a significant portion of this rather quickly over the next couple of years. So, all that coupled with the cost of the debt plus the outlook that we have, we think that it\u2019s a prudent structure, and I think we expect our debt to be investment grade and I think that also reflects the structure and our ability to execute our strategies without the risk or the financial distress that affect \u2013 sometimes goes with that. So \u2026 \nEd Lockwood\n\nOperator, next question?\nOperator\nAnd the next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKrish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nYes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one I had was just a follow-up on the special dividend recap question. Is it set as you had just pointed, you probably lived around and found out no suitable M&A candidates and decided this is a better way to return capital? And does it impact your 6.9% convert due in a few years? And I have a follow-up?\nBren Higgins\nAgain from the strategic perspective, we have looked at opportunities, we continued to look at opportunities to enable further growth and look for things that are going to be accretive to either our current business or places to grow. And when we evaluate that, we feel very well positioned with the product portfolio that we\u2019ve developed organically or through the M&A that we\u2019ve done in the past. And we\u2019ve said this on a number of occasions.\nWhile we look, we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s so compelling that we wanted to move in the past, or would have and we always compare the returns that we\u2019d get from that from what returns we get from an action like this.\nSecond one is we still can do M&A. If there is M&A that\u2019s compelling and accretive over time, we\u2019re not limited to do that. And so, our view is this doesn\u2019t disable that option. It just would have to pass hurdles that we make it long-term accretive to our company and that\u2019s always been the case. So we don\u2019t think that we\u2019re limited in anyway from the deals that we anticipate might come our way as we look forward.\nAnd then on the question on the 2018 debt, so that\u2019s straight corporate debt and option under consideration is do we \u2013 we may consider refinancing that. The financing is not complete yet, we don\u2019t want to get into the details ultimately of the various aspects of it. It\u2019s an option under consideration, and we\u2019ll update you at the appropriate time.\nKrish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nGot it. And then just as a follow-up, it looks like there is lot of activity going on in the foundry side, besides the FinFET-related yield issues, have you guys seen any pick up or incremental sales for 28-nanometer or are you just focused mostly on 20, 16, 14 at this point?\nBren Higgins\nWe do have some forecast in this. We did expect in the second half to see some incremental 28-nanometer activity. We didn\u2019t see that in the September quarter. We do expect some of that business in the December quarter. I think some of the lithography orders happened in the September quarter, and I think just given general lead time dynamics that would imply that other tools will follow. So we do expect some of that business. I thought we\u2019d see some of that in September and it looks like I\u2019m going to see maybe more of it in September \u2013 December quarter now.\nRichard Wallace\nYes, clearly there are players that haven\u2019t participated with that as a leading-edge node for them that have come to us for support and help, and to Bren\u2019s brands point, we expect to see that because as you know, that\u2019s the node that\u2019s probably generating a lot of the revenue and cash flow for the industry right now, not the very leading-edge stuff.\nKrish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nGot it. Thanks, Rick, Thanks Bren.\nRichard Wallace\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.\nBill Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan\nYes. Hi, good afternoon. This is Bill Peterson calling on behalf of Harlan. Congratulations on the recapitalization program. The question is actually more about the outlook particularly in the 2015. Wondering, with typically long lead times orders in hand, coupled with orders you expect in December, how do you see 2015 playing out in terms of first half, first second half? I understand \u2013 I\u2019m not looking for a forecast, but how do you see that playing out. And then I have a follow-up question.\nBren Higgins\nSo, Bill, I think the first half given the earlier comments, we think the first half should be strong given the ramp we expected associated with 16, 14 nanometers. Beyond that, though \u2013 it\u2019s hard for me to guess, I think we\u2019re consistent with everybody else. We see it as a year growth as we said in the prepared remarks. In the first half, we\u2019re certainly building to support a strong shipment profile through the first half.\nBill Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan\nOkay. And I guess the second part is, I guess, should we expect with some customers that the sort of lead times would be I guess become a new norm or is there something else that play, I\u2019m just kind of curios in your thoughts on where the typical lead times would be going between the key foundry?\nBren Higgins\nLead times have been coming in over the last few years. I think one of the byproducts of the mobility-driven cycle that we\u2019ve been in since 2010 is because it\u2019s consumer-centric. Our customers are more sensitive to consumer dynamic. They have less lead time, and so some of that lack a visibility passes through. It tends to be customer-specific. As we saw on the June quarter, we booked a significant amount of business in the foundry from a customer its end of the lead times. And I think based on another customer that we expect to see some activity from here coming up to support the ramp we talked about. The lead times are pulling in.\nSo it tends to vary across customers. But over time I think we\u2019ve seen them shrink. I mean, we\u2019re still sitting, I think we ended the quarter around five months a backlog, but it isn\u2019t six to seven months of backlog. And as we model it going forward, we model somewhere between four and five months generally. It does mean that we carry more inventory to be flexible, and that\u2019s certainly a dynamic that we has changed in terms of how we manage the company and the business. But we need to be able to respond and these are big orders from single customers and so we have to be sensitive and flexible to their plans.\nRichard Wallace\nAnd I think in general, Bill, as you know at the industry has transitioned much more of consumer-orientation for devices, and that drives the business. It\u2019s our customers don\u2019t really have a lot of visibility? So they\u2019re asking us to be responsive to their need to respond quickly. And I think in exchange for that, what we get is pretty close collaboration on their needs. We just don\u2019t get great inside entertaining largely because in many cases they are not sure.\nSo we have a lot of provisional plans that change pretty quickly and we try to synchronize those, but it\u2019s a challenge because the end markets move and the players are all trying to be positioned to take share when it\u2019s available to them. So we have to support that and to Bren\u2019s point, we\u2019ve taken on some inventory to be able to do that.\nBill Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan\nOkay. Thanks for that color, and good luck.\nBren Higgins\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.\nMahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC\nThank you, very much. Rick, you talk about next year \u2013 one of your peers talk about next year up, 5% to 10%. Let\u2019s say if the CapEx next year is up 5%, where do you think your revenue can track in that environment?\nRichard Wallace\nI\u2019ll give that to Bren.\nBren Higgins\nSo, Mahesh, I think a lot of it depends on the customer mix. I think after two years where we had pretty heavy memory spending, I think, underperformance relative to the market, I think with a ramp of a new technology we think that we should be able to go with the market in the next year. That certainly have, we\u2019re modeling it. But I think that\u2019s the more sensitive item. I mean, over the last couple of years I think it\u2019s been just a fundamental delay I think around some of the new technologies, whether on the NAND side or even in the foundry. And certainly that\u2019s put pressure on process control because the customer buying patterns are typically heavier when they\u2019re ramping technology.\nSo, given the assumption of the ramp into next year, we do believe that next year positions as for its growing at least that the market rate, and perhaps faster if process control intensity moves the way we think they\u2019re going to move on these new technology.\nMahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC\nAnd the second question on the debt. I\u2019m assuming that this is a special dividend and you\u2019re paying the basis. So, it\u2019s going to be tax-free to the investors. And also if you can give us some math around why do you need 2.5 billion of debt to fund this and because you have so much pretty good amount of cash in U.S.?\nBren Higgins\nYes. So the dividend versus return of capital calculation, which gets in whenever you pay a large special portion of it is dividend, and based on the tax retainer in over time, a piece could be return to capital. We don\u2019t have the specifics on that to share with you today. We\u2019ll share with that with you when we ultimately get where we pay the special. So that\u2019s how that works.\nOn the amount of debt, the way we thought about it was how far, how much debt could we borrow, we want to maintain investment grade profile as we said. We also had a plan around share repurchase. And so, once we pay the special and then go through the share repurchase commitment, we will have the U.S. cash number right around 500 million. And then most of \u2013 the way I am thinking about over time, the way we will drive this is our free cash flow into the U.S. will pay our ongoing dividend, and then the remainder will be targeted towards de-leveraging back to our long-term target to 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. I think the overall scope was driven by what\u2019s prudent for us, and also, clearly we thought it was important to maintain investment group profile through this.\nMahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC\nThat\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.\nBren Higgins\n\nWelcome.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello, your line is open.\nEd Lockwood\nOkay, operator, next question?\nOperator\nYour next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.\nEdwin Mok \u2013 Needham\nGreat, thanks for taking my question. So first question, we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of activity by (indiscernible) around the 10-nanometer logic process right now. And I\u2019m little surprised at your mask inspection order is low this quarter, I would suspect that some of those guys who start to order mask inspection tool for 10 nanometer. Can you give some color around that where is mask inspection and do you expect incremental order around 10-nanometer on mask inspection number one and then relate to that as, do you expect ramp up in those 10-nanometer activity to benefit you in 2015?\nBren Higgins\nYes, Edwin it\u2019s a good question. So mask inspection particularly around the mash up in your lumpy business, we had a decent quarter in June and we have a forecast for decent quarter in December. So there is some lumpiness to the order profile. As you might recall, and we\u2019re fairly open with this, we did book for a leading logic manufacture, we did both in multiple set of mash ups rules to support the 10-nanometer node with those tools shipping over the course of 2015, so with a lot of it in the first half of 2015.\nSo, there is some activity there. I think we\u2019ll start to see more of that activity as we move forward. I don\u2019t know how much of it we\u2019ll see in December. But clearly that\u2019s an aspect obviously of this transition to 10, but very limited activity on 10. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll start seeing orders for 10-nanometer beyond what we\u2019ve seen in very early development stuff, I don\u2019t think you will see any meaningful orders until we get closer to the end of next year.\nRichard Wallace\nAnd to that point, the existing capability that we have can support the pilot and R&D work. And given the fact that there are few sub 20-nanometer designs working anywhere except for some that one customer that then there is a lot of, there is capacity in the system to handle things until we see very ramp up of 14, 16, that will start to consume some capacity. And then the 10 is really been as Bren said in the path finding usage for the reticle tool.\nSo, (indiscernible) is just not going to \u2013 and it\u2019s going to be lumpy but it\u2019s not going to be eminent given the 10 nanometer so far out.\nEdwin Mok \u2013 Needham\nI see, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just talk about your commentary on the first half of 2015, you said strong driven by the 16, 14 nanometer investment from your customer. What about the memory side? Are we at least \u2013 are you seeing any subsiding in investment memory or do you think that we remain strong in the first half or is it more called back-half loaded in the memory side. What color can you provide to us? Thank you.\nRichard Wallace\nYes, I\u2019ll give my perspective, and Bren can way in. I haven\u2019t seen a lot of expectations of the building. I think that the strength and memory probably continues through 2015 at some level, probably not growing from here though. And most of the investment in Flash has been, as we talked in the past, plainer than 3D, there have been some in 3D but I think 3D is yet to come and that will be dependent on a number of factors, although we\u2019re participating in that.\nAnd then the DRAM side, we do see technology investment going and there are definitely some capacity ads being pursued. So I think memory, I don\u2019t see a big difference between Q1 and Q2, or I\u2019m sorry, first half or second half of 2015 for that. As you know, we don\u2019t really forecast that far out into \u2013 our visibility is pretty limited in terms of exactly where things are going to fall. So we struggle to predict much beyond what we\u2019re going to see in December.\nEdwin Mok \u2013 Needham\nGreat, that\u2019s actually very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAtif Malik \u2013 Citigroup\nHi. Thanks for taking my question, and then congratulations with the team with the special dividend. And the comment on FinFET push outs are quite understandable given your peers, (indiscernible) also talked about the uncertainty in the foundry markets. My question is on the lead times, Rick, and then for the same lines as Tim was alluding to. So if your customer\u2019s customers, they have to make their devices, let\u2019s say September next year, when is the latest pick in order of your (indiscernible) I\u2019m just trying to gauge if there is further risk in these bookings pushing out into the March quarter given your lead times that longer than your peers. And then, I have a follow-up.\nRichard Wallace\nYes, I think, given what we\u2019re seeing, I think that there is a sensitivity clearly to the end market dynamics there and I expected \u2013 frankly, I expected the orders in September. So I have some orders forecasted in December. And certainly that\u2019s the plan based on what we see today. But it does as we\u2019ve seen it has been a little bit fluid. I think given the calendar timing that we\u2019ve talked about and roughly three month cycle times on devices, you really have to start I think putting that capacity in place in the March and June quarters be able to deliver those schedules.\nAnd so that\u2019s I think the calendar, that our cadence that we\u2019re looking at in terms of expected delivery. But could it be a situation where I get very short lead times, I guess I get orders from customers and they turn around and run shipments in a couple of weeks. That could happen. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it does at some level, but this is \u2013 we\u2019re trying to give you as much guidance as we get based on the conversations we\u2019re having with the customer. And certainly, we\u2019re positioned to be able to respond with the flexibility to be able to deliver in a meaningful way end of the first half of the year.\nBren Higgins\nYes, until the point of \u2013 if you might have last two quarters, [we missed] (ph) low in terms of the midpoint and the June quarter, we miss high and then this low. So we\u2019re not very good at forecasting the next 90 days. And so, we really think about it in a longer term basis and the way I think about it, how it\u2019s adoption relative to our model and expectation and how we\u2019re doing relative to share.\nAnd timing is something we have less influence over. But certainly from an adoption standpoint, we\u2019re seeing it. I think 14 and 16 will be good adoption for \u2013 we\u2019ll see strong adoption for process control, but we\u2019re not seeing it yet because that investment is not there. I think our market share continues to be strong. But until they place few orders, we don\u2019t know. So, it is true, we\u2019re going to be I think short term very bald all in terms of the ins and outs.\nAtif Malik \u2013 Citigroup\nGot it. And then as a follow-up, you guys talked about the 2D NAND investments are more dominant right now than then CD investment. Could you rank for us the reason for that? Is it that economics of CD are not at par with 2D or that\u2019s yield-related or just memory makers are just trying to keep a tight supply/demand balance as 3D could add more depth in the market?\nRichard Wallace\nWell, clearly, there is a continuum of process maturity for the different providers. Right, yes. People that are already yielding devices and enable the ship and shipping in small volume, the other still in development, you have others early on development. So, I think it really ranges whereas 2D capacity is much broader. So, to the degree there is market demand for NAND. I think there is a big opportunity for everybody to participate in that. So, you\u2019re going to see planar NAND continue.\nI do believe that people have underestimated the challenges in 3D both in NAND and also in FinFET, in terms of integration and yield and some of that we can help with and some of that\u2019s just debugging the processes. So, when there is a robust market environment, I think many of our customers will produce the products that they can produce. But the crossover plain, once the 3D is working of 3D flash is going to be compelling as well.\nBut it\u2019s got working in get to economics that makes sense. And we anticipate as soon as that happens in calendar 2015. But it\u2019s kind of a bit of both, the economics don\u2019t work, the demand isn\u2019t there but if it does work, there is a lot of interest in the customers for it.\nAtif Malik \u2013 Citigroup\nAll right, thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Stephen Chen with UBS.\nStephen Chen \u2013 UBS\nThanks. Hi, Rick and Bren. Just a follow-up question on the recapitalization, did the company consider a management buyout in perhaps seeking shares from the put and take and why not just the management buy out here?\nRichard Wallace\nNo. We didn\u2019t consider. This was given our situation that wasn\u2019t something we consider. What we considered was what\u2019s a prudent level of debt that the company should be taking on to optimize our capital structure and then what\u2019s the best way, the most efficient way to return cash to shareholders after we\u2019ve gone through and evaluated uses one and two of cash, which is invest in our business, look at accretive M&A or enabling technology. But no, we didn\u2019t, we weren\u2019t looking at management buyout.\nBren Higgins\nI think when you have a business like ours that has strong technology position, a differential margins, the ability to invest and therefore generate strong operating margins and a strong cash flow profile. I think you take that and you cover it with, what we clearly see our changes in the mix that of our industry that lends itself to I think a more predictable earnings stream overtime.\nAnd so, business like that certainly has the capacity to carry more debt and to Rick\u2019s point, when you look at the first two considerations which we work through, at least for now, as we saw this is the best opportunity to deliver incremental value to our shareholders as we execute what we believe is a very solid plan going forward.\nSo that was the thought process. And again, the level of debt determined by our goal of what makes sense for our business as exhibited by the investment grade profile that we have and then obviously how do we move forward with it?\nStephen Chen \u2013 UBS\nOkay. Thanks for that, Bren. And then just a follow-up on the ongoing business, so it looks like you\u2019re seeing the improved gross margins in both the September and December quarter, I missed the main driver that got you back into the gross margin range in September, does it \u2013 the period that you\u2019ve overcome those issues that occurred in the June quarter? Thanks.\nBren Higgins\nYes. The June quarter I had a couple of issues on revenue mix where some of the tools that came in on the revenue side had a weaker revenue mix profile. And I also had higher than expected cost in my service business. And so that drove one-time weakness, if you\u2019ll, into the June quarter. I think we saw a very normal gross margin structure play out as we went into this quarter, something more consistent with what we\u2019ve seen historically and consistent with our model.\nSo the mix turned out to be a little bit more favorable, and I think the dynamics I saw on the service business corrected and it\u2019s more consistent with our expectation for that. So \u2013 and I think as we look into the December quarter, the same dynamics play out.\nStephen Chen \u2013 UBS\nOkay. Thanks, Bren.\nBren Higgins\nYou\u2019re welcome.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray.\nUnidentified Analyst\nHi, good evening everyone. This is Sean on for Ruben. I just wonder if you could give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about gross margin, gross margin profile for 2015, given the ramp that you\u2019re seeing for 16 and 14 and then just opportunities for expansion headwinds there, just some kind of directional indication of how things could play out.\nBren Higgins\nYes. The gross margin profile on our latest products that we\u2019ve introduced is actually \u2013 is very solid and very consistent with our historical pattern. We believe we\u2019ll see incremental gross margins between 60% and 70% going forward through 2015. And so, I think we\u2019re very well positioned as we see this pick up in business into the first half of the year for very good gross margin performance and very consistent with our historical model.\nUnidentified Analyst\nGreat, and if we get the \u2013 you talked a little bit about ongoing focus on investment in the business, I\u2019m just trying to think about your OpEx levels into 2015, is this something that will continue to grow, how do we think about the magnitude of that growth or whether it\u2019s roughly consistent with where we see it currently?\nBren Higgins\nWell, the first half of this fiscal year, the September quarter and the December quarter coming up, I expect it to be a higher OpEx level than we expected in the second half. And that was driven by some programmatic timing on some next-generation programs. So I think the second half of the year comes down from the first half, I\u2019m modeling the year right now, the fiscal year around 935 million, so given the performance in Q1, and what we guided for Q2 does imply somewhere around that $230 million range in the March and June quarters.\nAnd so, our OpEx levels are really dependant on what\u2019s required to support our roadmaps. And I think we\u2019re not necessarily on where the revenue level is. So if the business is stronger, I don\u2019t think it changes our OpEx all that much, it turns out to be marginally weaker. I don\u2019t think it changes that much either. So it\u2019s really driven by the business requirements in maintaining the differentiation that we need to support the gross margin profile that enabled that investment.\nRichard Wallace\nYes, just to add to that; one of the big initiatives we have been investing in this is what we call the 5D solution for lithography from multi-patterning, and well, we\u2019re seeing little bit of revenue from those efforts. I think that\u2019s an investment that will show up in future years as we continue to build out the suite of products and solutions we have to support multi-patterning going forward.\nSo that\u2019s part of the step up in the increase, but to Bren\u2019s point, we\u2019re looking to don\u2019t see dramatic increases beyond our current levels, but we\u2019ll continue to invest in the business as we go forward.\nUnidentified Analyst\nGreat, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. That\u2019s it.\nOperator\nThe last question is from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.\nWeston Twigg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities\nHi, thanks for squeezing in it. I have three really easy questions; one is, shipments last quarter you expected \u2013 you said you expected shipments to trend higher each quarter through the fiscal year. It sounds like you\u2019re saying the same thing today, but I wanted to verify that, that is the case. The second question is \u2013 I\u2019m just \u2013 if you could remind us how much cash you currently have off-shore? And then the third is, are you planning share count for the December quarter?\nRichard Wallace\nOn shipments, we guided next quarter at 70 at the midpoint. And yes, I think given the commentary around the second or the first half of (technical difficulty) exact number, but about 1.2 billion at this point of the total of the 2.9. And share count that we\u2019re modeling is about 165 million in December.\nWeston Twigg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities\nVery helpful, thank you.\nRichard Wallace\nYou\u2019re welcome.\nEd Lockwood\nOperator, that concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining, and we look forward to seeing you later on in this quarter.\nOperator\nThis concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.\n\n",

This is Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Thank you all for joining us this morning.\nToday I am joined by our Chairman, Micky Arison, via phone from Italy; as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, who heads up our Investor Relations, here with me in Miami.\nBefore I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.\nOur company is off to a strong start this year, with first quarter adjusted earnings nearly double the prior year and well above the high-end of our December guidance range. The first quarter results combined with our strong book position has enabled us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our full year earnings expectations.\nI am proud to acknowledge all of our employees globally for the industry-leading guest experience efforts that are essential to our sustained earnings improvement. I especially thank our travel agent partners for the critical role they play in connecting guests with our great brand experiences.\nIt was reinforcing to see revenue yield growth of 5.7% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of mid single-digit yield improvement. We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements in our core Caribbean itinerary, which represent 47% of our first quarter deployment.\nWe drove revenue yield growth at Costa by creating relative scarcity through our brand team success and increasing demand via ongoing guest experience efforts, coupled with new impactful creative featuring Shakira. While at the same time we reduced supplies in more challenging trading environment in Southern Europe by transferring Costa capacity to China.\nAs you'll recall, our Costa brand was the first global cruise lines to homeport in China back in 2006. Today we are the largest in China and the first global cruise company with six ships based there across two of our brands, Costa and Princess, representing nearly half of the Chinese cruise industry.\nWhile it represents less than 5% of our global capacity, for us China continues to be a promising unit growth opportunity. China has quickly become the world's largest outbound travel market at an estimated 135 million strong, yet just over 1 million cruise today. We expect to continue to grow over time, and have further plans for AIDA and Carnival Cruise Line to enter China in the near future.\nChina contributed to our strong quarterly results. We absorbed over 60% more capacity there and enjoyed strong profit improvements and return on invested capital accretion. At the same time, the capacity shift to China help create relative scarcity in our other markets, supporting global revenue yield growth.\nBeyond China, during the quarter, we made further progress globally in creating demand for all our brands in excess of measured capacity growth. Part of that demand creation is the excitement around the much anticipated deliveries of AIDAprima, and I can tell you, she is well worth the wait. The ship is absolutely fantastic. The first of a next-generation platform for AIDA that combines leading-edge environmental attributes and well designed features that foster an exceptional guest experience.\nAll of her features, whether racing waterslides, a lazy river, multiple climbing wall, an expansive German spa, an ice rink for skating for hockey, for curling, and even a traditional Christmas market, together create an experience that truly resonates with AIDA's nearly exclusively German guests.\nAnd we have additional opportunity for demand creation in just a few short days with the delivery of Holland America's new flagship, Koningsdam. Koningsdam was designed with our Holland America guest in mind, and to reintroduce Holland America to those who have yet to experience our award-winning service, our five-star dining, our expensive enrichment programs and compelling worldwide itineraries.\nOur new flagship will offer fine dining in several alternative restaurants, including a new French seafood brasserie and a new immersive farm-to-table dinner experience in the Culinary Arts Center.\nPart of enhancing an already great Holland America guest experience, includes taking onboard entertainment to a whole new level. We have carefully engineered a Music Walk area, which showcases different genres by offering chamber music in Lincoln Center Stage, rocking the crowd with chart-topping instant Billboard Onboard and bringing the best of Memphis music to sea and our popular B.B. King's Blues Club. Responding to our guest, our new flagship will feature Holland America Lines first ever purpose-built staterooms for families as well as single staterooms.\nNewbuilds will also provide additional demand creation opportunities later this year as well, with the delivery of Carnival Vista followed by Seabourn Encore. When it comes to ships, newbuilds are not the only way to stimulate demand creation.\nWe continue to invest in our existing fleet to further enhance guest experiences, including the recent recreation of Holland America's Eurodam, incorporating many of the same experiences onboard as Koningsdam. In addition, we are undergoing an expensive remastering of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 later this year.\nDestinations are often a powerful tool for demand creation as well, especially when combined with effective public relation. Last week, we made history, when we became the first U.S. cruise operator in over 50 years to receive Cuban approval to bring U.S. cruise guest directly from the U.S. to Cuba. We made worldwide news, showcasing cruise in a very positive light, with nearly 5 billion media impressions and still counting.\nWe very much look forward to launching our historic Cuba inaugural season in May with Fathom, initially with itineraries including Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. We believe there is no better way to experience so much of Cuba in seven days than with the enriching guest experience on our premium Fathom brand.\nAs the Adonia carries just 700 guests per sailing, if you have any interest in seeing Cuba, do an extraordinary travel experience, I sincerely recommend you book now. Concerning the future of cruises in Cuba, we have already begun the process for approval for other brands to sail for Cuba in the months and years ahead.\nNow, beyond ships and destinations, our ongoing marketing and promotional efforts are also a part of demand creation. As part of our effort to keep cruise in the forefront of vacationers' minds, Princess is airing a new reality based show on primetime U.K. television entitled, The Cruise.\nThe documentary follow the lives of our amazing crew and guest onboard, Regal Princess, through a six-week series. In fact, we've already seen a 40% increase in web traffic for Princess in the U.K. since the show began airing. Also airing in the U.K., P&O cruise's Battlechefs, a new cookery contest set at sea onboard Britannia, featuring five celebrities testing their culinary skills and judged by celebrity chef Marco Pierre White.\nIn Italy, Costa Fortuna was to set up a major motion picture, Vacanze ai Caraibi, holidays in the Caribbean, launched early in the quarter, partially cast with Costa crew members. More recently an episode on Italian reality TV I colori dell'amore, the colors of love, was based on the love story between two young Costa crew members, who met onboard.\nIn North America, just last week, Carnival Cruise Line was featured nightly on the ever-popular television show, Wheel of Fortune. While early in the quarter, Carnival announced an exceptional partnership with Grammy Award winning country music superstar Carrie Underwood and Operation Homefront, supporting now U.S. Military personnel. Media coverage from that announcement alone generated more than 1 billion media impressions and our Carnival brand continues to outperform.\nAlso in North America, we partnered with AT&T and Samsung to create a virtual reality experience that showcased in nearly 1,200 AT&T stores, promoting consideration for cruise, while allowing new to cruise to virtually experience a cruise vacation. We estimate nearly 400,000 people have already had the virtual reality experience, showcasing our portfolio of leading brands. All of these efforts heighten global awareness and consideration for our [ph] world leading cruise line, as we continue to capture a greater share of the vacation suitcase.\nDuring the quarter, we continue to make progress on cross-brand efforts to leverage our scale. On the revenue side, work on our revenue yield optimizing system continues, and the summer of 2016 will be rolled out on 30% of our inventory. The prototype will cost the yield uplift as well as inspire improvements for final system development.\nSo as most of this year's bookings will be behind us by the summer, we look forward to a greater contribution on this effort in 2017. And on the cost side, work in our procurement area continues. We have negotiations underway on 16 separate purchasing categories with 22 more RFPs outstanding. All of which will contribute to our stated $75 million of expected cost savings in 2016.\nOur ongoing operational improvement is a testament to the success of our combined efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth and to leverage our scale. The strong first quarter we have enjoyed, affirms our conviction to deliver this year's earnings forecast and accelerates progress to our double-digit return on invested capital. We remain well on track for the delivery of over 8.5% return on invested capital this year and crossing the double-digit threshold in the next two to three years.\nAt the same time, we have accelerated our return of capital to shareholders. Since resuming our stock repurchase program late last year, we have completed our first $1 billion share repurchase authorization and are well into our second billion, bringing the cumulative total of purchase to date to $1.3 billion and approximately 27 million shares. We plan to continue to return free cash flow to shareholders, with our strong balance sheet and leverage ratios now comfortably at the better end of our targeted range.\nAnd now, I will turn the call over to David.\nDavid Bernstein\nThank you, Arnold. Before I begin, please note, all of my references to revenue ticket prices and cost metrics will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2016 first quarter results. Then I'll provide some insights on booking trends and finish up with an update on our full year 2016 guidance.\nOur adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.39. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our December guidance, despite $0.01 drag from fuel and currency. The improvement was essentially driven by two things; $0.07 from net ticket revenue yields, which benefited from stronger pricing on closing bookings on both sides of the Atlantic; and $0.03 from lower net cruise cost, excluding fuel, as a result of timing of certain expenses between the quarters.\nNow, let's turn to the first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 4%. Our total net revenue yields were up 5.7%.\nLet's break apart the two components of net revenue yields. Net ticket yields were up almost 7%. As Arnold indicated, we enjoy ticket price improvements on both sides of the Atlantic. The increase was driven by the strength of pricing in the Caribbean, which represented 47% of our capacity in the quarter.\nIn addition, our European, Australian and Asian brands, also known as our EAA brand, showed solid price improvements on the year round European program. Onboard and other yields increased almost 3%, in line with December guidance. The increase was mainly related to bar, casino and communications, as our efforts in these areas continue to pay dividend.\nNet cruise cost per ALBD, excluding fuel, were up about 1.5%, which was less than planned in our December guidance, again due to the timing of expenses between the quarters. In summary, first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.19 higher than the prior year, driven by operational improvements worth $0.15 and favorable net impact of lower fuel prices and currency worth $0.03.\nNow, let's turn to booking trends for 2016. Bookings during this year's wave season were strong. Volumes are ahead of last year's historically high level at higher prices. At this point in time, for the remaining three quarters of 2016, cumulative fleet-wide bookings are well ahead at slightly higher prices. The fact that we are well ahead on the book position with less inventory left to sell for the remainder of the year compared to last year, bodes well for pricing over the next few months.\nNow, let's drill down into the cumulative fleet-wide book position. First, for our North American brand. Caribbean occupancy is well ahead of the prior year at nicely higher prices. For Alaska, occupancy is in line with the prior year, also at nicely higher prices.\n2015 was a great Alaskan season, and I'm happy to say 2016 is shaping up to be even better. For the seasonal European program, occupancy is nicely ahead of the prior year at lower prices, driven by the geopolitical risk impacting the Mediterranean trade as anticipated in our guidance.\nSecondly, for our EAA brand. For Europe, occupancy is ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices. Australia and Asia are consistent with our prior guidance. While we are behind on pricing and not surprisingly behind on percentage occupancy, given our over 60% increase in China capacity and our significant increase in Australia capacity, remember, Asia and particularly China is the unit growth opportunity and we are achieving strong unit profits and returns that exceed our corporate average.\nFinally, I want to provide you with an update on our full year 2016 guidance. As Arnold indicated, our first quarter results combined with strong book position enables us to increase the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.05 and raise the floor on our earnings expectations for the year.\nOur 2016 March guidance is now $3.20 to $3.40. The $0.05 improvement was driven by improved net revenue yields worth $0.04 and the accretive impact from the additional shares we repurchased since our December call worth $0.05. These improvements were partially offset by $0.04 drag from fuel and currency.\nNet cruise cost without fuel per ALBD are still expected to be up approximately 2%. No change from our December guidance. While we were favorable to the guidance for the first quarter, as I previously indicated, the favorability was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.\nRemember that while the year is expected to be up approximately 2%, there are differences between the quarters. The first quarter was up about 1.5%, while the guidance for the second quarter is expected to be up only 0.5% to 1.5%.\nHowever, for the third quarter, we expect net cruise cost without fuel per ALBD to be up 5% to 6%, driven by the remastering of Queen Mary 2 in dry dock and higher advertising expense. Offsetting that, however, is the expectation that cost will be down slightly in the fourth quarter.\nSo far this fiscal year, we have repurchased over 21 million of our shares, and we still have almost 700 million left under the second $1 billion share repurchases authorization that was approved by the Board of Directors just two months ago. Our March guidance EPS calculations assume approximately 760 million shares outstanding on a weighted average basis.\nOn a final note, for your planning purposes, I wanted to let you know that we expect our June conference call to be a little later in June than usual to allow some extra time for quarter-end reconciliation and analysis, given that we are currently in the process of implementing a significant upgrade to our Oracle enterprise reporting platform, which includes moving to a single instance of the general ledger as we further leverage our scale.\nAnd now, I'll turn the call back over to Arnold.\nArnold Donald\nThank you, David. Operator, please open it up for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Kent\nA couple of questions. One, first can you just -- I think it was David, you just made some comments on China and I want to understand them. Are you saying that pricing is still higher in China than the rest of the world? You're adding capacity in China and that this is a unit growth story? I wanted to understand those two things.\nSo to me it sounds like almost like you're simply adding more capacity at a higher price relative to the rest of the fleet, but that the pricing maybe is not as high as it was maybe last year, is that what you're saying? And then, one other thing on this China opportunity, which I think it's outsize attention, because it really is a huge opportunity and is a big pricing opportunity too is, how were the travel agent doing in that market? Is there anything we can read from them and their reaction to the capacity that is coming in?\nArnold Donald\nI'll answer the travel agent, or who we call the distributors in China, questions first. We don't have direct line of sight into their profitability, but what I can tell you is that our relationships are strong, they continue to book with us. Our actual occupancies on sailings are the same and we're seeing great results. And we see no easing of interest or demand or anything from the distributors. And the best line of sight we have is that the relationship is working for us and for them, and is definitely working for us.\nYou had a question, I'll let David answer directly the question you asked of him.\nDavid Bernstein\nSteve the yields are higher than the group average on the ticket prices, but that's not really our key metric. I mean, operating income per ALBD is really the key metric and there too deals are higher. So that is what we're looking at as a metric in terms of overall for China.\nBut one other thing I will add, keep in mind, is since mid last year, the Renminbi is also devalued by 7%. So when you're looking at an apples-to-apples comparison on a current dollar basis, that does affect the overall ticket yield and the overall yields for our China business.\nArnold Donald\nI think, Steve, the main point is China is a very positive story for us, it's strong, it's a contributor, it only represents 5% of our capacity today. So we were well-positioned from that regard as well. But it's definitely a nice add and we certainly have benefited from it and see continued strength.\nDavid Bernstein\nAnd let's not forget the benefit that we see in the rest of the world, as a result of the growth in China and the more measured capacity growth in the established market, which is 95% of our business.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley\nI have two questions, one is, I'm just curious, there is no change in your full year yield guidance, but Q1 obviously came in quite a bit stronger. That sort of implies that your next three quarters guidance is lower from where you thought it was, which I think is not the case, and you're probably just being conservative. So I wonder if you could -- if anything I would think, the strength of the close in bookings in Q1 would lead you to feel better about the next three quarters. So I wondered if you can just sort of address that.\nDavid Bernstein\nWell, Robin, as I indicated in my comments, the first quarter our revenue yield was worth $0.07, it beat on the guidance. So $0.07, keep in mind, is 0.4 for us in total in terms of the full year yield. And when you take a look at it our yield guidance for the year was approximately 3%. So depending on where you are, if you're 2/10 of a percent below that, and now you're 2/10 a percent above that, so essentially it's still approximately 3%, and the rest of the year it didn't change.\nRobin Farley\nAnd to the strength of the close in is not changing your view on the next three quarters?\nArnold Donald\nWell, obviously, we're going to strive to do better, but what we experienced so far, it gives us conviction to maintain our guidance, and actually we've increase guidance by a nickel. And we feel very positive about our booking situation, so obviously we're going to strive to do even better. But at this point, with all the dynamics around the rest of the world, and the fact that the Caribbean, which has been very strong for us becomes a smaller percent of the total in the subsequent quarters, we think it's prudent to stick with the guidance we've given.\nRobin Farley\nAnd then my other question was just on China, and you talked about the tremendous potential for unit growth there. Can you just put a little color around, the Carnival brand originally was going to send a ship there for the first time in '17, it sounds like that is now going to be '18. Is that just sort of taking time to market a new brand that you wanted to give a little more lead time to, or just given -- obviously, the volume growth in China?\nArnold Donald\nThe CCL decision, the Carnival brand decision in China, when they originally gave their estimate, it was a preliminary thing. As they got into the detailed deployment planning, we have a number of home ports here in the U.S. serviced by the brand. And as they looked at moving ships, ships fit in certain ports, not in other, so on and so forth, it just became prudent for them to look at launching in '18 rather than in '17, but it's strictly around deployment planning, they had nothing to do with the environment in China.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.\nHarry Curtis\nA follow up question on the booking and yield strength. Just turning to Europe for a second, can you give us a sense of the recent incident in Brussels and whether or not that's had any impact? And, David, I think that I didn't catch fully your outlook for Europe based on your current booking strength. I think you said, it was slightly higher, but I didn't catch the occupancy?\nArnold Donald\nFirst of all, obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families in the Brussels situations. It's really too early for us to know the exact impact of that. Historically, there has been some temporary impact from events like this and the level of the impact depends on a lot of different factors.\nBut historically, eventually people adapt. We don't know exactly where we're in the process at this point, but right now we see no reason to change guidance. And as you know, our philosophy is, things happen every year, and we anticipate that without knowing exactly where or what things will happen and we factor that in to an extent, so it's too early to see the full fallout of that, but at this point in time, we're comfortable with the guidance that we've given and see no reason to change it.\nDavid Bernstein\nAnd far as the booking position, for our EAA brands, which really is the majority of our European program, we said that for Europe, occupancy is ahead of the prior year, at slightly higher prices. And for the seasonal programs for our North American brand, which is really just like 5% of our overall capacity for the company, we said that occupancy was nicely ahead, but the pricing was a little bit lower because of the geopolitical risk and the things that Arnold had indicated.\nHarry Curtis\nAnd then my follow-up question speaks to the share count assumption. David, you mentioned, but I'm not sure I caught this right that the guidance for the balance of the year assumed a fully diluted share count of 760 million shares. Is that correct?\nDavid Bernstein\nThat was for the whole year. And as I think I had indicated in the December call, the way we do our guidance is we include the shares that we purchased to date, because as we've always said, our share repurchase program is opportunistic, so built into our guidance, does not include any future share repurchases. And as I mentioned, we do have almost $700 million left on that second $1 billion, so we do have the opportunity to continue to repurchase.\nHarry Curtis\nYou anticipated my last question, thanks very much, guys.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities.\nJames Hardiman\nSo just a real quick clarification on some of what's been going on in Southern Mediterranean based on some of the terrorist attacks. Have you had to move any itineraries around at all? And if so, does not have any impact on your numbers?\nArnold Donald\nThere is always in every year some itinerary adjustments. And we go where people want to go. So if we see there is a heavy reaction from guests about going to particular itinerary we have previously planned, obliviously we will choose to alter that. So yes, there have been some changes in some of the ports in Turkey, for example, this year.\nWe still have a number of brands going to Turkey. And we are in constant contact with every intelligence agency in the world and all the various security and enforcement agencies as well. Safety to our guests is number one. But frankly, right now, we see more just, it was driving our decision making is the desire of guests to go to locations, and that's where we are right now.\nJames Hardiman\nAnd then just maybe walk us through the changes in fuel and currency, since the last time you guys reported. The constant currency numbers for both yields and costs look to be unchanged, but the current currency numbers look to be slightly better for both. Now this might just be a rounding thing and these are all approximate estimates or maybe it's a function of the repositioning of ships.\nBut normally sort of things get better for yields and worse for cost or vice versa. It seems like they got a little bit better with respect to FX. And then, with the fuel, certainly the crude oil prices that we look at have gotten a little bit worse, although your guidance for the year seems to have gotten a tad better. Just walk us through some of the puts and takes there.\nDavid Bernstein\nI'll start with fuel. You probably noticed that overall, for the year, our guidance is $2 per metric ton better. At the moment in time that we did the December call versus our March guidance, I mean Brent was within $1. The crack spread was virtually the same. So the numbers moved very little on the fuel side. Of course, we have a little benefit there. We had offsetting that with some additional derivative losses. So the overall fuel number was negligible in terms of a change from our December guidance.\nCurrency did move against us. And remember, we have a basket of currencies, so it depends on the movement. The one currency from December through March that moved the most was the British pound. And if you look back, we were using $1.51 as the rate for the British pound back in December. The rate now, I think in our press release in the second quarter was like $1.43, so there was like a 5% movement. So depending on what you're looking at because of the different basket in currencies and the movements, the British pound is the biggest impact. And that was a negative impact on our bottomline. And that's what drove the majority of the currency drag.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.\nFelicia Hendrix\nDavid, just I wanted to clarify some commentary that was in the release in the outlook section, please. When you were talking about the cumulative advance bookings for the first three quarters of 2016, in the release, it said that they're well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher constant currency prices. And then in the December release, you talked about 2016 in the context of slightly higher prices. So I was just wondering is there any difference in the two outlooks?\nBeth Roberts\nNo, they're both constant currencies.\nFelicia Hendrix\nAnd then also, Arnold, on the last call you had talked about the high end of the guidance range, the net yield guidance range for the year is being 4%. I know you reiterated the 3%, but just wondering, if you are looking at the high end simply.\nDavid Bernstein\nYes, I think, Robin, the reason we had said -- \nBeth Roberts\nFelicia.\nDavid Bernstein\nFelicia, sorry, I apologize. The reason why we had said the high end of the range was 4%, it related to the $3.40. And when you start looking at the midpoint of our guidance, it was a $0.30 range and a point of yield is $0.15. So we had said, the $3.40 related to a 1% higher yield or 4%. So obviously, time has gone on and we narrowed the range down to a $0.20 range. But we're giving you the best estimate that we can. It's still relatively close to approximately 4% at the high end.\nFelicia Hendrix\nAnd then can you just refresh us in terms of how much of that is ticket and onboard? Has that changed?\nDavid Bernstein\nIt really hasn't change significantly from the December guidance, the ticket and onboard. The December guidance, we used about 2% for onboard. And it was a little over 3% for ticket, and it [ph] did round into approximately 3%.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.\nJamie Katz\nMy first question is on this revenue management yield system that you guys are using across your brands. And I think the commentary you guys indicated that about 30% of the inventory would be up over the course of the year. And I am curious, first, when that might be completed if all the brands will eventually be on it? And there was a comment that there would be some yield uplift, so I guess I'm am curious what your expectations for benefit there are?\nArnold Donald\nSo on the revenue management tool, that we're implementing we have six of our brands that initially will be on the new tool. When it's implemented this summer, we'll only have about 30% of their collective inventory going through the tool. Obviously, that will ramp up over time and we'll have more inventory that goes through it.\nBy the time is up and running, '16 will be pretty much booked, and so the real impact we won't see until '17. But I have to tell you, we are enjoying some benefits now just from the brands collaborating and working on the tool together, sharing lots of information. There is improved decision making going on, on revenue management all along the way, and is definitely contributing to some of the yield improvements that we have enjoyed the past few quarters, including us this past quarter.\nSo overtime, when we go to the next phase of the tool, which will be implemented next year, pretty much all the brands will be using the tool. We have some brands that have already more sophisticated tools than others. And this to, both base flow that will be at one level of sophistication, we put the next layer on top, it will be at a whole another level of sophistication, so we'll have a build of impact over the next few years from having the tool. And it will make a difference.\nJaime Katz\nAnd then I have sort of an esoteric question for you guys. How do you think about differentiating the brands that are going into the China market versus the competitors? Obviously, Costa has been there for some time, there is a lot more brand awareness than maybe some of the other brands. But I think the messaging going through the travel agents, the way that the distribution network there works might be a little skewed. So I am curious if there is an easy way to articulate how Carnival's brands in the region are different and maybe a better value to those consumers?\nArnold Donald\nThe easiest way to do it is to actually have the distributors experience the brands, because once they go on to ships and experience the brands, the difference is dramatic and very much get a very different feel from one brand to the next in terms of what type of cruise experience it is.\nAnd because those brands resonate around the world across different, what we call, psychographic segment, with 1.3 billion people, China is very capable absorbing lots of different brand. And so we see it, at this stage, as we just have a toe in the water. There is an 135 million estimated outbound Chinese tourist today already. And less than 1 million of them or maybe roughly 1 million of them are cruising today. So we haven't even begun to touch the surface hardly, so there's plenty of room and capacity.\nOur belief is that at the consuming level, at the guest level, that in the price ranges we're in, the guest today are relatively price inelastic, whether I'm in Australia -- I was in Cuba last week, Mainland Chinese filled the paladar that I was in the private restaurant in Havana, I was in. And so they have money, they're able to travel. They're not exactly shopping for price. They fill up the retail outlet and spend several levels higher than the typical tourist would from other places in the world.\nSo we don't see any major barriers at this point except, as you just referred, good communication, execution, training the distribution system, giving them the exposure they need, so they can represent the various brands well. We think there is plenty of room for everybody, for several of our brands, and we're going to bring AIDA in, in '17, and the Carnival brand right now is scheduled to go in, in '18.\nJaime Katz\nAnd then lastly, just a housekeeping question. With so much capacity coming on can you guys offer your outlook for D&A in the current year?\nBeth Roberts\n$1.716 billion to $1.780 is the range for the year.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.\nGreg Badishkanian\nJust to put the Brussels impact in perspective, kind of comparing it to the Paris attacks, any change in behavior that you have seen that were different than the initial 10 days or so with North American sourced passengers versus European sourced, as well as cancellation rates?\nArnold Donald\nThat again, it's early. In Paris, there was impact on bookings, which faded pretty quickly. May have had some net minor impact on results, but again, it's one of many things affecting us in Europe, and we factor that into our guidance, but its still early for Brussels. We haven't seen anything dramatic yet. The question is how things build and so on. But frankly, again, we've kind of have it in our guidance, barring some major dramatic shift in reactions.\nGreg Badishkanian\nSo nothing dramatic, that's [multiple speakers].\nArnold Donald\nNothing dramatic, no.\nGreg Badishkanian\nAnd then moving just to Cuba, and kind of thinking about the opportunity. And congratulations, by the way, in getting your ship there. How quickly before you think that you'll be able to ramp up capacity in Cuban? I know there is a regulatory perspective and then there is just a logistical perspective?\nArnold Donald\nYou nailed it, both. First of all regulatory first, so we already are talking to Cuba obviously about the other brands and when might they come, and which ports, and so on and so forth. We're looking forward to working with Cuba to help develop the cruise industry there. We think, again, it's is a different story than china, but it's similar and that there's room for everybody. And we're looking it as a refresher for the Caribbean.\nWe think it's going to help us. It's going to help the industry. It's going to help the Caribbean. And it is certainly going to help Cuba. So we're excited. We're very honored and privileged to have been given the honor of being first for approval by Cuba. And we're really enjoying the working relationship and looking forward to working with them.\nIn terms of timing of all this, the logistics do matter too, because our ships, we just talked about, the brands being booked by the summer for '16 pretty much. And so itineraries have been established, guests are planning on going places. As we get additional brands approved by Cuba, those will have to adapt to their current itinerary planning schedule. So practically speaking, while we may have some additional itineraries in 2016, you're probably looking at 2017 for any kind of significant impact.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.\nTim Conder\nJust a couple clarification questions. One, on your yield guidance, the basically 1% difference due to the change in accounting that you called out in December, is that built into the guidance now or not? I just want to clarify that? And then secondly, David, I think you -- or Arnold, when you were commenting on China relative to one of the earlier questions, just to clarify, did you say at this point yields were up, down, as they are looking for the year?\nArnold Donald\nFirst of all in China, again, it's a unit growth story. We want to keep emphasizing that. But to answer your question, yes, ticket yields are higher than the average for the fleet, and they're forecasted to be that for the year. So that's the truth. But we don't want you guys over focusing on yield, because the real story is the great accretion and earnings that we're getting from China and it is going to be a volume growth story for a while, because at the very beginning, we're nascent in that market, and there is just so much potential in that market. In terms of [multiple speakers].\nDavid Bernstein\nThe other question was about the counting reclassification, which yes, we built into the guidance in December and we built that into the guidance in March. There is no change in the methodology there. And it is about 1%.\nTim Conder\nAnd, Arnold, I apologize, it was just my question and clarification on China was just more -- I totally understand it's a unit growth story and that they're the highest in the world, and it's a positive mix as things continue to grow. But just more on a year-over-year comparison, flat, slightly down?\nArnold Donald\nWe've never given a range on yields in China, but yields are down on just a year-to-year basis, but we've never given a range and wouldn't do so now.\nTim Conder\nAnd then to stay kind of on that versus the rest of the world, any color for the industry that you could comment on as to how maybe the tiny yields combined are different relative to say North America or Europe?\nArnold Donald\nNo, I don't have color for you on that.\nTim Conder\nAnd then two other things on yield and that will be it. The implied net yields in your guidance for the year, just by major geographic region, Europe, Asia, North America? And then specifically related to the Brits and onboard spending, anything that you're seeing given the pound depreciation that you have seen here since the beginning of the year or over the last six months in onboard spending trends by Brits in particular?\nArnold Donald\nJust onboard in general, onboard revenues for us has increased increase ever year over the last, I don't know, 10 to 12 years, except one. And so onboard revenues tend to increase every year and your question is how much. Last year, we had a large percentage increase on onboard revenues overall. And this year, we've seen again a increase on top of that, not necessarily at the same level as last year, but a nice increase.\nAnd so the correlation to economies and all that tend not to -- we have difficulty tracking that and correlating in any specific way even the degree of increase in onboard revenue isn't always correlated to particular economic conditions in a given destination market or given source market. And so there's just so many variables that come into that, not the least of which is us constantly giving guests more of what they want.\nAnd if you do that, the guests onboard will spend more. And that's really, the issue for us is always tweaking that and figuring out exactly what do guests want, so we give it to them in the way they want it, what they want in the way they want it. And we continue to grow. So to be honest with you, we haven't seen -- we've tried it every which way and we just haven't seen tight correlations to general economic trends.\nDavid Bernstein\nAnd also keep in mind, that the overwhelming majority of our British guests sail on P&O Cruises, which is the British pound onboard, so as far as they're concerned, there really is no change. Of course, it does affect on a translation basis, those onboard revenues into U.S. dollars, but it doesn't change their spending patterns onboard.\nAnd as far as the overall cruise revenue yields are concerned, we have talked in December, between our North America brands and our EAA brands. We were expecting increases in both segments of our business. The increases were slightly better in the North American brands than the EAA brands. Once you net out the accounting reclassification, which I had mentioned, affected the EAA brands in December.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Kevin Milota with JPMorgan.\nKevin Milota\nJust have two quick ones here. First, obviously, China fairly small right now in terms of total capacity at 5%. With your capacity introductions in '17 and '18, could you give us a sense for where your total -- where those capacity stats will be in those years? And then secondly, I guess, for David on fuel. At current fuel levels could you give us a sense for what's baked into the $3.20 to $3.40 guidance as it relates to the unrealized losses from your derivatives?\nArnold Donald\nFirst of all on China, as you know the industry, believe it or not, is capacity constrained because of the limited number of shipyards to build ships. And obviously, we've got partnerships with both, Fincantieri, and with Meyer in Germany, in terms of securing slots to enhance our fleet.\nHaving said that, in China, we can't grow too fast, because just the limited availability of ships, so we'll probably be by 2020 somewhere in the 8% to 9% range of our fleet, which means, most of the growth in capacity we have will actually be going to China. And that means, that we'll be growing at a much slower rate in the rest of the world markets, 1% to 2% there, while big percentage increases in China, but in terms of absolute number of ships still relatively small compared to the latent demand that exists in the country.\nSo to answer your question by 2020, depending on how things go, and that's the beauty of this, we have flexibility. Depending on how things go we could be 8% and 9% of our capacity in China. And that means, therefore, that we didn't grow a lot in the rest of the world, but that fits with our measured capacity growth overall plan to help create relative scarcity.\nWe can change the drive demand to create excess demand relative to that measured capacity, which obviously allows us to capture or the value gap that currently exists between land-based vacations and cruise. We're still a much better value than land-based vacations and we have lots of room to move. David?\nDavid Bernstein\nAnd as far as the derivatives, you said unrealized, but I think what you meant is how much was in our guidance in terms of realized losses on the fuel derivatives for the year and the number is about $330 million of realized losses.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Ian Rennardson with Jefferies.\nIan Rennardson\nJust a couple of questions for you. How much more are you sold than this time last year? Is it 5%, is it 10%, is it 20%? Could you give us a sort of numerical answer, please? And moving on to yield expectations, Q2, 1.5% to 2.5% growth at constant currency after a very strong end to Q1, you mentioned close in pricing, why this sort of slight disconnect, please?\nDavid Bernstein\nSo we are ahead on bookings, but we don't give the details for competitive reasons about exactly what percentage points we are ahead. So we just rather leave it more general. And as far as the comparisons on the quarterly basis, the second quarter is lower than the first quarter, but you got to remember, you got to look back against the prior year, the second quarter last year was much stronger than the first quarter.\nWe were up 2% more in the second quarter. So it has a tougher comparison in the prior year. As well as the fact that, in the first quarter this year, we had indicated, we were 47% in the Caribbean versus 30% in the second quarter. The Caribbean was a very strong market for us. And so you are seeing some differences between the first and second quarter in terms of yield increases.\nArnold Donald\nBut that yield improvement in the second quarter, obviously, is consistent with the overall guidance. And it's going to lead us to 20% or better at the midpoint of our current guidance earnings improvement year-over-year.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon with Berenberg.\nStuart Gordon\nJust a quick question on the close in bookings, have obviously been very strong and held beat on the yield. Could you give an indication as to whether this has been helped by less sort of onboard concessions that's helped drive up that ticket price rather than driving up onboard spend?\nDavid Bernstein\nWhen we package -- what you're talking about is some value-added packages. And when we provide those value-added packages, we do segregate a portion of the revenue and record it in onboard. So you wouldn't see an artificial drive-up in ticket prices from a value-added package.\nStuart Gordon\nBut did you have to give away less value added packages in the close in of this quarter, which than perhaps has been the case in previous quarters?\nArnold Donald\nWell, certainly, compared to the prior quarter, the yields are up significantly. So overall pricing at total was stronger, whichever way you want to look at it. And so that means, I don't know whether they gave more packages out or not, but again, that would have been reflected on our onboard versus ticket. But the practical reality across the fleet, we have so many different brands, but across the fleet overall close in was much stronger this year than last period. So that means that they reduced pricing less.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.\nJared Shojaian\nHave you guys stopped hedging fuel? It looks like you haven't put on anything new for a while. Can you just give us an update on your current policy here?\nArnold Donald\nWell, we had collars that went out a number of years. And right now, we continue to live with those, as you can see from the derivative losses. So at this point in time, we evaluated constantly to see what we should do. In the past, we did it to avoid a significant spike in fuel pricing that could have created any kind of short-term cash issues. And we don't see, at this point in time, a need to do anything. We are collared on all the way into 2018 at various levels. I think next year is -- David?\nDavid Bernstein\nNext year, we've got 8.1 million barrels collard.\nArnold Donald\nWhich is what percent?\nDavid Bernstein\nA little over 50%, and 5.4 million barrels in 2018, which is less than 50%. But as Arnold said, we're collared out almost three years. So we're comfortable with our current position. We constantly talk about it and analyze it and think about it. But as you said, we haven't done any fuel derivatives since it was October of '14. And we'll give it more consideration as we go forward.\nJared Shojaian\nAnd then should we expect the pace of your buybacks year-to-date to continue throughout the balance of the year? And if so, are you comfortable financing CapEx in order to do that? And if not, can you just help us understand why you wouldn't take on some incremental debt right now, while still being able to maintain the investment-grade credit rating?\nArnold Donald\nWell, yes, you bet. First of all, we do have an authorization. We will do as we've done in the past, which is opportunistically use that authorization. Beyond that, that's a Board decision. The Board is constantly looking at it. In terms of our debt position, we're, as you can tell by our balance sheet, in a pretty good shape. I'll let David add any additional color you would like. Go ahead, David.\nDavid Bernstein\nWe have said many times that we would return all our excess free cash flow to the shareholders. We have done that. We did get the second $1 billion authorization from the Board of Directors. We'll be opportunistic, as we purchase throughout the rest of this year. And when we get completed with that we'll take a look and we'll talk to the Board about what's next. But you've to keep in mind, this is a Board decision, so we don't want to preempt the Board. But when we get done with the $700 million, we'll look at potentially what's next in the program.\nArnold Donald\nOne last question please, operator?\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.\nDan McKenzie\nWith respect to the revenue beat, I'm just wondering how much of it was tied to investments and advertising spend over the past year? And then with respect to the uptick in advertising in the third quarter, I am wondering why then, and how you have been measuring the link between the campaigns and the revenue production?\nArnold Donald\nWell, as you know, we have 10 brands. They all have segments that they are catering to. And they all have their independent marketing plans. We do look at it collectively. We are leveraging our scale in terms of looking at common media buy and those types of things to be even more efficient as paying dividends for us.\nBut the reality is, we are expecting a return on any investment we make and that includes advertising and whether it's mass media advertising, product placement advertising, digital, all the various forms of it, and PR, public relations efforts.\nSo our belief is that we have to keep cruise out in the public space in a positive way on a constant basis, so that when people are considering vacation, there has been enough noise about cruise that, they say, well, I have an idea, let's look at a cruise. And so, the idea is to just keep it out there and that's utilizing all the various forms.\nThere is no question we have created incremental demand. We also know there is no question that an incremental demand has been in part created by the fantastic work of our team members across our 10 brands who literally exceed guest expectations every day when they come onboard. And that word of mouth and that personal experience of having your expectations exceeded is the most powerful marketing tool we have by far. And that is by the work of our people in engineering, the experiences on board and then delivering against it.\nSo to your question, yes, we have increased advertising overall. We will continue to look at it. We don't do it willy-nilly. We do a lot of measuring and tracking to see what kind of impact we get both in attitude and in bookings and so on. And we're constantly monitoring that and tweaking it. But the third-quarter rationale is a peak communication time to prepare for the coming year. And that's why you often see an increase in that period.\nDan McKenzie\nThe next question gets at the competition for the upper scale traveler, and specifically, your key competitors have products within their core brand to chip away at that market share in that segment. And so you have got the Norwegian Haven, the Royal suite products, looking ahead Virgin seems poised to also chip away at the upper scale traveler. So I'm wondering if you can help us put some brackets around the revenue that this market segment represents. How you are thinking about these moves by key competitors and how Carnival is responding?\nArnold Donald\nYou bet. Our primary competitor is land-based vacations. One of every two people who cruise in the world cruise with us and we have tremendous respect for the other companies that operate. And we want them to be successful. That helps us a lot. The stronger they are the better it is for us.\nSo having said that we have 10 brands, we have ultra-luxury in Seabourn, we have luxury in Cunard both our Queens Grill and Princess Grill, we have Holland America on Neptune. We have premium brands in Fathom, our newest premium brand, but obviously our long-established premium brands of Princess and Holland America and AIDA. And we have mass contemporary brands like Costa and Carnival.\nSo we look at that, but again, the really important thing about cruise is this, we've had Steve Wozniak, who we pay to lecture on Seabourn, but he pays to go on Carnival, okay, because it's not a demographic choice per se, we have taxi drivers who will save for five years to go on a Seabourn Cruise and we have billionaires who want to sail on Carnival. And the reality is the experience that you're looking for.\nAnd each brand is a different experience, caters to a different psychographic market. So we have ultra-luxury brands, luxury brands, premium brands, et cetera, each with their own experience and that's what drives it for us. But for us, we are definitely looking at penetrating more land-based vacations, because all the cabins in the world added up together in the industry represent less than 2% of the hotel rooms in the world. So that means there is 98% of the market to chase as opposed to 1% because of that 2%, 1% is ours already. So that's kind of our approach.\nEnd of Q&A\nArnold Donald\nThank you very much. I really appreciate the questions. Thanks for your support. We look forward to talking to you guys next quarter and in between. And as always, feel free to call Beth with any additional questions or insights you might want to offer us. So, thank you.\nOperator\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.\n\n\n",

My name is Adrian and I will be your conference operator today. At first time, I would like to welcome to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you.\nMr. Brian Rice, you may begin your conference.\nBrian Rice\nThank you Adrian, and good morning everyone. I would like to thank you for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call.\nWith me here today are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; Dan Hanrahan, President and CEO of Celebrity and Azamara Cruises; and Ian Bailey, our Vice President of Investor Relations.\nWe have posted a number of slides on our investor website www.rclinvestor.com which we will be referring to during this call.\nBefore we get into our results and talk about the current operating environment, I would like to remind you of our notice about forward-looking statements which you will see on the first slide.\nDuring this call, we will be making comments which are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures.\nAdditionally, we will be discussing certain financial measures which are non-GAAP as defined by Regulation G. And a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.\nRichard will begin the call with a strategic overview of our business. I will follow with a brief recap of the first quarter, update our guidance, and provide some insights into the recent demand environment in our financing activities.\nAdam and Dan will then talk more about their brand and how we are managing the business in the current environment. Then we'll be happy to open the call to your questions. Richard?\nRichard D. Fain\nThanks Brian and good morning everyone. I must admit that I find myself a little bit conflicted about the earnings that we are sharing with you today. Its tough to be pleased about a quarter, that's resulted in one of the few losses we have posted in a long time, and in fact we'll never be happy with a loss situation nor am I happy with the profitability we are looking at for the full year.\nOn the other hand, this past quarter provided us some very significant wins for us. The most remarkable news about the quarter and about our outlook is that we have very little new to report. Overall, the year's developing pretty much in line with what we said three months ago. Some positive, some negatives but bottom-line basically the same.\nMost importantly, our revenues continue to track above where we expected them to be. Stronger close-in bookings helped us to deliver outstanding cost control. Forward bookings showed some downside buyers but overall remarkably in line with what we had predicted.\nWe did not previously assume that the economy would get any better and we're still lumpy seeing our projections on any economic improvement. But some months ago the market had begun to stabilize and we are happy that the level of stability has continued to increase.\nEven in normal times, I'm always impressed with our revenue management team's ability to predict revenue within such narrow parameters. I'm still amazed in how accurate they've been in the past and how accurate their predictions over the last several months have been.\nAdmittedly, we're providing our guest more value than we would like to these days. And pricing continues to be miserable, but at least it seems to be at a miserable level that's relatively stable.\nI am pleased that it does not appear necessary to reduce the guidance range of our expected yield deterioration. And I'm also pleased that volume is remaining surprisingly robust given the current economic climate. Overall, while this is certainly not an enjoyable business environment, I'd say it's at least manageable.\nAs I mentioned in prior calls, our focus on liquidity has dramatically increased and looking out on long-term forecasts are better today than they were previously. How many companies that you follow can make such a statement?\nNow that we've completed Oasis, some people may question our ability to finance more at the end of 2010. And I do admit that it's hard to show it on an excel spreadsheet or an SEC filing. But I think our success with the financing of Oasis of the Seas demonstrates the power of the factors we have previously discussed to help us accomplish such things.\nWe have 30 or 40 years relationship with the shipyard, the people of Finland and with our banks. These things actually do matter even in today's world. I'd also like to take this opportunity to congratulate our management team on their excellent work in controlling our costs or continuing to provide an excellent product.\nYou can see the results of their efforts and it is very impressive. What you can't see is the fact that our passenger ratings are also at their highest level in years. We believe it is possible to control cost while maintaining strong branding momentum and you can see that philosophy is working. Part of it is of course is due to a natural offset.\nThe weaker economy hurts our revenues, but it also presents opportunities for improving our costs and we are doing everything we can to take full advantage of those.\nIn addition, as I've noted in prior earnings call, the growth of international operations means that foreign exchange has become a more relevant driver of our performance. Again, this provides a natural hedge because the stronger dollar hurts our revenues just as it helps our expenses.\nOverall, we're still deeply disappointed to be talking about a smaller loss for the quarter rather than a bigger profit and we're disappointed that the whole year profit looks to be only half of what it was last year. But in this economy, I think that actually shows just how strong and how resilient our industry and our company are. Imagine how we will look, once things start to improve.\nA further comment on deployment and itineraries; one of the on the cruise line business model is that our assets float and that they can be shifted as markets and circumstances change. A year or two ago, everyone was talking about the great strength of Alaska and worried about the possible weakness in the Caribbean. Now the situation has reversed itself.\nNow we don't change course in a dot (ph), but we are able to move ships around in relatively short period of time to go where they are wanted, and ships do go where they are wanted.\nTurning to our international expansion; that continues to develop successfully. It does require a major commitment of resources, but the potential benefits are also major and we intend to pursue them aggressively.\nThere've been a lot of questions about Alaska. Sometime ago we announced, very quietly that we're reducing our capacity in Alaska initially by one ship. Alaska continues to be an important market for us and one that we wish we're going in the other direction. Regrettably, the referendum has led to many of the unfortunate consequences that we have feared for us and for Alaska.\nI think a lot of people were misled about what it would do, and I wish we had done a better job of explaining the inevitable implications. Now this has been and it will continue to be an awful full year, and (inaudible) horribleous (ph) to use the Queen's words.\nPricing is still terrible and the economy dreadful. But we continue to see powerful evidence demonstrating yet again how resilient our business is. We are determined to continue improving our profitability even in this environment and preparing ourselves to rejoice as the markets recover.\nWith that, I'll turn it over Brian for more a detailed discussion of the quarter's results. Brian?\nBrian Rice\nThank you Richard. I would like to briefly go through the first quarter results which we summarized on the second slide. In the first quarter, we had a net loss of $0.17 per share versus our guidance of loss between 30 and $0.35.\nOur revenue yields for the quarter were down 13.5%, which was better than our guidance down 14 to 16%. Ticket in tour revenue came in slightly better than we had forecasted and onboard spending was consistent with our forecast.\nAs you know, there have been significant swings in foreign exchange rates over the last year. In addition to the success of our global expansion efforts, that means almost one-third of our revenues and a quarter of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because of this, we thought it would be helpful to give you some insight into how exchange rates impact our results.\nIn the first quarter, the stronger dollar negatively impacted our yields by about 4 percentage points. So if we were to report on a constant dollar basis, our yields would have been down around 9.5%. You may also recall that during the quarter we refunded approximately $30 million in fuel settlement that cost us about 2.5 percentage points in yield. So while the revenue environment has been very challenging, I think our results were more resilient in this very bad economic mix cycle than many have thought possible.\nOn the cost side, net cruise costs excluding fuel per available passenger cruise day came in 6.8% below last year and it's the better end of our previous guidance. And while the stronger dollar per revenues in the first quarter, we are fortunate to have a natural offset and saw benefits on the cost side.\nOn a constant dollar basis, our costs would have been down about 4.5% compared to last year. Our fuel expense was $155 million for the quarter, which was 10 million better than the anticipated at the time of our last call. And assumption was about 2% better than forecast and pricing was slightly favorable.\nOverall (ph) net cruise costs for APCD improved by 7% versus the same time last year, and were better than -- our previous guidance is down between 4 and 6%.\nWithin other income and expense, we had an out-of-period charge of $7.1 million. During the quarter, we'd learned that a software program we licensed for purposes of evaluating the fair value of our interest rates swaps contained an error related to the LIBOR curve. And the $7.1 billion represents the accumulative reduction in the fair value of certain swaps related to 2007 and 2008.\nDespite this charge, the combination of better revenue performance and lower costs enabled us to come in about $0.15 better than the midpoint of our guidance.\nNow I would like to provide you with an update on the booking environment. Over the last three months, we have seen a fairly consistent demand environment. The booking window is certainly more contracted that we had seen in 2007 and 2008 and much of the demand is being driven present by aggressive pricing.\nThe good news so is the consumers becoming more predictable and our discounting is level off over the last few moths you may recall on our fourth quarter earnings quarter we showed you a graph of the first question trends months which demonstrated how we move closer to the day to departure booking significantly improved mostly without any additional pricing erosion.\nOn slide three, we have updated the same chart to show you how the first quarter continued to evolved from the time of our last call. The green line shows the change in the volume of new business versus the same time for the prior year by the week in which the booking was made. The blue line shows the year-over-year pricing changes for new business.\nSince our last call, the volume of new guest booking continued to be much greater than at the same time last year. The pricing levels as compared to a year ago remained relatively consistent.\nIf you turn to slide four, you will see the second quarter departures are behaving much the same way that the sailings that occurred in the first quarter debt. Bookings lagged behind a year ago levels until we reached the end of January. Since then the volume of new business has improved significantly and year-over-year pricing changes have been very stable. We are very fortunate to have good systems that enable us to map consumer behaviors and adapt our revenue management style to the changes in booking patterns.\nClearly, we would all sleep better at night with an expanded booking curve and less uncertainty but we grow more confident each day that our models have better calibrated to the new consumer buying patterns.\nOn slide five, we have graphed the same booking information for third quarter departures. By today's standards, we are still fairly early in the booking cycle and we are now entering a very important period for new bookings. But again, the same pattern that we witnessed in the first and second quarter seems to be developing in the third quarter and the momentum of new business for third quarter sailings has begun to accelerate.\nOur revenue management team watches this type of information at a very final level of detail. It is constantly adjusting to capture the most revenue out of the available demand. In updating our guidance, we have again assumed that not much changes in terms of consumer behaviors in the overall economy.\nOn slide six, we have provided our updated guidance for the second quarter and full year. Historically, we have given a broader range of both yield and earnings per share projections. But given the nature of the environment and the wide ranging views in the market today, we have tried to be as transparent as possible and provide you with our best estimates.\nThere is obviously more uncertainty today than usual, but the predictability of our booking is better everyday and we believe that risk of a dramatic deviation continues to fall.\nFor the year, we expect yields will be towards the lower end of previous guidance or down between 12 and 13% and on an as reported basis and down 9 to 10% on a constant dollar basis.\nWe expect yields to be down around 17% in the second quarter on an as reported basis and around 12% on a constant dollar basis.\nIn the third quarter, our comparables for Pullmantur become much easier as the Spanish economy was one of the first to feel the impact of the global recession.\nNonetheless, we expect challenging yields in the third quarter as our product mix is simply weighted towards seasonal premium itineraries such as Alaska which were struggling the most. At this time, our best estimates have third quarter yield change on both in as reported basis and on a constant dollar basis to be slightly better than the second quarter.\nAs we mentioned in our press release, both the second and third quarters are impacted by about 5 percentage points at current dollar exchange rates. As you may recall, the dollar became much stronger during the fall of last year as the global economy began to deteriorate.\nAccordingly, at today's level, the impact of foreign exchange is projected to be substantially less in this year's fourth quarter.\nTo help illustrate this, on slide seven, we have graphed the current spot rate for the British pound and the Euro as compared to the average exchange rates we experienced last year in the second, third and fourth quarters.\nIn the second quarter of last year, the average rate for the British pound was about $1.98. Today Sterling's spot rate is better $1.45 or 25% less. As you can see, the value of these currencies was substantially higher in the second and third quarters of last year.\nWhen we get to the fourth quarter though, the comparable rates of exchange are much closer to today's spot rates. Another benefit, if you will, of this year's fourth quarter is the impact we had already absorbed from the economic downturn last year.\nUnfortunately, the sudden and dramatic nature of the recession had a substantial impact on last year's fourth quarter. But as a consequence, our benchmark this year will be lower.\nLastly, we are seeing a very favorable in the fourth quarter from the introduction of the Oasis of the Seas. I do not want to steal Adam's thunder, so we'll wait for him to elaborate.\nGoing back to the previous slide, we have further improved our guidance on the cost side and now expect net cruise costs excluding fuel to be down 6 to 8% for the year and down approximately 9% for the second quarter.\nIncluding fuel, net cruise costs are forecasted to be down 10 to 12% for the year and between 11 and 12% for the quarter. And while the stronger dollar has hurt our revenue projections, it is helped our cost guidance.\nIn the second quarter, we are receiving about a 5 percentage point benefit and for the year, a little less than three percentage points.\nWe have included $574 million of fuel expense for the year and $142 million for the second quarter in our guidance based on current pricing. We are 51% hedged for the second quarter and 48% for the full year.\nAnd while we have not entered into any additional contracts since our last call for 2009, we have been more aggressive hedging fuel further out. We are now hedged approximately 40% for our 2010 forecasted consumption and about the 25% for 2011.\nOur business model works quite well at the current pricing and we felt it was prudent to take advantage of this opportunity.\nAnd lastly for guidance, we are projecting the second quarter earnings per share to be roughly breakeven to slightly down and the full year to be approximately $1.35.\nNow I would like to update you on our financing activities and liquidity. During the first quarter, our treasury team was quite busy. As you know, last weak we announced that we had obtained just over $1 billion in unsecured financing commitments for Oasis of the Seas which is scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter.\nThe Finnish have always been great to work with and really help make this financing quite smooth. In addition, we were fortunate to work with three of our banks with which we have great relationships and the club nature of the deal enabled us to get this done quickly and on good terms.\nWe also entered into two credit agreements for unsecured term loan for up to 80% of the contract price of Celebrity Equinox which is scheduled for delivery in the third quarter and Celebrity's fourth Solstice special which is scheduled for delivery in 2011. Both have 12 year terms in semi annual amortization.\nCelebrity Equinox will bear interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 50 basis points which was locked into back in 2005. Solstice four will bear an interest at a fixed rate of 5.82% based on terms originally agreed to in 2007.\nI'm sure the next question many of you will ask is what about lower the fees in next year's debt maturity. The lower is still about a year and a half away from delivery, but we have already started early discussions. I'm not going to go into any specifics, but as we said with Oasis, we are comfortable we will get the necessary financing.\nAs far our scheduled debt maturities go, we remain confident that current liquidity coupled with forecasted operating cash flows would be sufficient. That said, we are always looking for ways to further improve liquidity.\nWe pride ourselves on having very solid relationships with our lenders, finding ways to support each other. For example, since we filed our 10-K, we have moved out some of our maturities and agreed to prepay a $100 million 2010 maturity in 2009 while extending another $100 million payment due in 2010 out until 2011. The net effect of this improved 2010 liquidity by $100 million.\nI could speak for a while about the contingencies we have and the actions we evaluate on a daily basis to improve our liquidity position. But I do not think it is prudent to publicly speculate on possible next steps given our current sound position and the very dynamic nature of the market today.\nI do think we have demonstrated our resolve in this area and we've also shown sensitivity to the interest of our lenders and shareholders.\nOur liquidity at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion including over $450 million in cash and $625 million available on our revolving credit facility. The primary driver of the improvement in liquidity from year end was the sales of the Celebrity Galaxy to our 50% owned German joint venture TUI Cruises.\nNow I will turn the call over to Adam for his comment about the Royal Caribbean International brand.\nAdam M. Goldstein\nThank you, Brian. Good morning everyone. As you have heard, market conditions continued to be very challenging in the first quarter and the sacrifice of rate to achieve traditionally high occupancies was very evident.\nEven in difficult times, we believe Royal Caribbean International is achieving a premium versus our primary competitors. However, pricing is materially down in comparison to any period prior to the fourth quarter of 2008.\nAlthough the pricing weakness affected all products, it was most prominent in a number of our developmental programs where there are not matured cruise markets that will respond in volumes of pricing stimulus, as is the case in North America, even in recession. This included our products in Asia, Australia, Brazil and Panama.\nIn a number of source markets, for example Brazil and Mexico, currency devaluation exacerbated the shock of the recession. So, on the whole our Caribbean programs were the most successful during the quarter albeit at reduced yield.\nLooking forward, the evolution of our full year guidance for the lower end of the range we've previously established has been covered by Brian and Richard. They each noted the increased stability of our ticket revenue generation. I would like to add some color on the influence of some of our major product groupings on the development of our guidance from three months ago till now.\nOur Caribbean products have favorably influenced our new full year guidance. Of course, the Caribbean this summer will not be immune to the pricing pressures we are seeing everywhere. But relative to our other products, it continues to be the most robust. Our two freedom class ships in the Caribbean continue to generate substantial premiums to the competition and to the rest of our fleet.\nI should note that short cruises in the Caribbean always offer the least visibility and are especially hard to predict in 2009 given the late booking nature of the current marketplace. Our European products have had a neutral to slightly favorable influence on the evolution of our full year guidance.\nGiven there was a recession, a stronger dollar and growing capacity, our European yields will be weak in 2009 on a year-over-year basis. Fortunately, however, our strategic expansion in Europe is delivering benefits to our brand as the number of Americans cruising in Europe has decreased. We estimate at about three-fourths of our guests in Europe this season will originate from European source markets.\nAlaska, as has been lightly reported, is suffering disproportionately on a yield basis and has had a negative influence on the development of our full year guidance over the last three months. Given we have had no growth in our Alaska capacity for several years, we did not expect the price declines we are experiencing even in the recession. The deficit extends to our Alaska tour business where 2009 will not match 2008 which was our best year ever.\nOur exotic and developmental products have also had an unfavorable influence on our guidance. Most of this impact is already been experienced in the first part of the year. We are taking a conservative view of the early part of the upcoming winter season even limit its visibility in several emerging markets where bookings are typically late and where the markets are experiencing recessionary conditions.\nMoving on to the ship we do not have yet, Oasis of the Seas. There continues to be great publicity for the ship as a whole and for several of the most notable features which are understood now as neighborhood. Despite the success of our communications efforts, we are simply unable to describe how phenomenal this ship will be. We are very pleased that this shipyard is sufficiently confident in the construction process.\nWe have advanced the delivery date by a week until late October. This will allow our team an extra week to prepare for the first revenue filling which is December 1st.\nWhile we are still over seven months out from that sailing and visibility remains limited, the level of bookings and the prices for Oasis first 10 months is very exciting. In fact, the price Oasis is commanding in the context of our historical experience in the Caribbean seven night market is really quite remarkable.\nAs I stated last quarter, on board revenue is meaningfully down but to the same degree the ticket yields are down. This weakness is across the major onboard revenue components and is exacerbated by the reduced number of Americans and European cruises, as their purchases of shore excursion is normally an important driver of summer onboard revenue.\nFinally, we continue to focus on cost control. And I would like to express my appreciation to our leadership team for their efforts in this regard. Very fortunately, despite the cost reductions we have made, our product is generating a entire satisfaction ratings for the last few years and continuous to be very deserving of the premiums that commence. Dan?\nDan Hanrahan\nThank you Adam, and good morning everyone. As you have heard from Brian and Adam, we are working through particularly challenging times. While both ticket and onboard revenues for Celebrity exceeded our first quarter expectations, they are still well below 2008 levels and represent an extraordinary value to the consumer.\nWe are seeing very similar results in Europe and Alaska which Adam mentioned, so I will not go through the market-by-market detail. While the revenue decline is frustrating, there were some bright spots. Solstice just finished off her debut season in the Seven Night Caribbean market and even in these challenging times, at favorable yields versus 2008.\nThese positive results were not only versus our other ships and similar markets during the same time period, but versus Q1 2008 as a whole.\nIn Europe, Solstice and Equinox are also holding up relatively well and are continuing to command a healthy premium to our other hardware. By any measures, Solstice has been a terrific addition to Celebrity. The response from gas travel agents and the media continues to be beyond what we had expected and gives us confidence as we are preparing for delivery of Equinox and Eclipse.\nWe will launch Eclipse in the spring of 2010 which is a third of the Solstice class ship. Eclipse will be dedicated to the U.K. market. We recently opened Eclipse for sale for the 2010 year of pan season. Although still early, indications are quite encouraging as the ship is booking ahead of expectations. And over 85% of those bookings are U.K. guests.\nWe're quite pleased by the response of the U.K. market to Eclipse. This gives us confidence that our plan to continue to expand Celebrity stores in outside of the U.S. is on the right track.\nI also mentioned onboard revenue. Our onboard revenue challenges continue to be driven primarily by gaming and other auctions. Our areas of strength are phone, Internet, shore excursions and Solstice.\nWe've seen similar success for onboard revenue for Solstice that we have seen on ticket revenue. While there has been onboard revenue pressure on the celebrity fleet, Solstice has helped to offset the challenges and as the result we were able to exceed our Q1 expectation.\nWe continue our diligent focus on costs while maintaining and improving the experience for our guests. This is an area that received constant attention from the Celebrity leadership team. Brian?\nBrian Rice\nThank you Dan. Adrian, we'd now like to open the call to questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva of Infinity Research.\nAssia Georgieva \u2013 Infinity Research\nHi, good morning. This is Ashley. A couple of questions. Dan, on your comment on onboard spend for shore excursions and net auctions (ph) are the biggest challenges. Can you discuss spa and other trends and how you expect that to shape up during the summer season when you have a lot more European passengers? And I'll ask my second question afterwards.\nDan Hanrahan\nYeah, Ashley what I actually said was that our onboard challenges were driven primarily by gaming and net auctions and where we've seen strength has been phone, Internet and shore excursions in Q1.\nIt will be interesting to see what we see in shore excursions in Europe. Last year when we started to see some softening in the European market for Celebrity and ticket we saw short excursions hold up pretty well. We think part of what's going on here is our guests they've just been very cautious about the way they are spending there on their onboard money and they want to make most of their vacation experience and a shore excursion is also a way to do -- always a way to do that.\nWe also sell shore excursions I guess book shore excursions ahead of time. We've seen that continue to be good. The area that you mentioned spa continues to be above as it has been over the last couple of quarters for us. We will see some softness there. But where we are seeing the most has been in gaming and net auctions.\nAssia Georgieva \u2013 Infinity Research\nOkay, okay. Thank you. And a question, quick question for Brian. Could you give us some detail on the Oasis financing in terms of whether you are leaning towards the fixed rates and what you expect the range to be. For example, Solstice was at almost 5.8%, a little bit higher than the other financings. Where do you expect Oasis to end up in terms of interest?\nBrian Rice\nI see first I think 5.8% in today's market is quite exciting to have a 12 year fixed term 5.82%. I think we are extremely pleased with that financing. We are still working through some things on Oasis, as we said when we issued the press release. We have an option at fixed floor floating. We're actually considering perhaps taking a portion of the debt in euro and there is two separate trenches; there is the SEC trenches and there is the bank trench and we are working through that.\nI will tell you that we're still a couple of weeks away probably from finalizing it but our best estimate at this point in time where we'll probably end up given today's pricing, is probably somewhere in the range around 7%.\nAssia Georgieva \u2013 Infinity Research\nOkay. Around 7. Okay. That's quite helpful.\nBrian Rice\nAnd that would be the -- that's a mix of some fixed and some floating. That's our best guess right now.\nAssia Georgieva \u2013 Infinity Research\nAnd you expect to have a mix of floating inside?\nBrian Rice\nYes. We're trying to manage a portfolio here. We tend to keep between 40 and 60% of our interest rates at fixed and we're kind of looking forward as to what we'll be electing in another financing as well. But right now it looks like it will be a mixture of fixed and floating and it will probably come out right around 7% given today's rates.\nAssia Georgieva \u2013 Infinity Research\nOkay. Thank you Brian. And my last question is more about Alaska. When we I guess try to reduce the impact of the $50 head tax, is it by extending the links of the voyage is I'm sure you are aware home, the amount of cushions is just trying to offering two week Alaska is still that we need to as and when it comes. Are you considering going towards a step right back maybe a 10 day voyage or even a 14 day voyage in 2010? Do you still have flexibility in that?\nAdam Goldstein\nHi, it's Adam. We've announced our sailings for 2010 and we're going to continue on our seven-night patterns with the two ships the Royal Caribbean will have there and the three ships that Celebrity will have there. And this is because our market, our demographics, our psychographics respond to that length of cruise in Alaska and we're not going to deviate from what is the sweet spot for our market even in difficult times.\nAssia Georgieva \u2013 Infinity Research\n\nOkay. Any thoughts on deployment 2011 and beyond given how much weakness we have seen, including for the tour division (inaudible)?\nAdam Goldstein\nWell, we understand the deployment choices are critical for our business, not only for Alaska but for our entire portfolio but its very, very early in this strategic deployment considerations for 2011 from April of 2011 onwards. We will be announcing those decisions in early 2010. So the next six months are really the strategic window of opportunity to consider our choices and go from there.\nAssia Georgieva \u2013 Infinity Research\nThanks. At the end one thing, Adam maybe you can help me with this, on Europe, have you seen any deterioration in pricing since wave season ended more specifically the last four weeks or so?\nAdam Goldstein\nOur pricing has been fairly consistent. In fact part of our overall message here is that we've been able to have fairly consistent stable pricing over the last three months since our previous guidance and Europe is encompassed by that.\nAssia Georgieva \u2013 Infinity Research\nThank you so much and good job on your cost cutting efforts. Keep that up.\nAdam Goldstein\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski of Stifel Nic.\nSteven Wieczynski - Stifel Nicolaus\nYeah good morning guys. First, I don't know if I just don't see it, Brian maybe you can help out here. What are the average fuel cost per metric ton for the quarter?\nBrian Rice\nActually Steve you've got something that I don't have in front of me. I apologize. We frankly didn't focus that much on fuel. I can tell you our rates were down slightly for the quarter and our consumption was down 2%. But if you could follow-up with on and after the call, we can certainly get that data for you.\nSteven Wieczynski - Stifel Nicolaus\nOkay. Will do. And then I'm not sure if you'll be able to answer this or you -- I doubt you will. But what's the average price in terms of, if you looked at crude right now of where you're kind of locked in for a little bit further I'd say 2011 at this point?\nBrian Rice\nWell I can tell you that we're certainly underwater in '09 on our hedges, but that's included in the $574 calculation we gave you. We have been hedging recently. If you were to compare our pricing out into 2011 against the forward curve right now, we'd be very close to where the forward curve is for 2011.\nSteven Wieczynski - Stifel Nicolaus\nOkay. And then last question for either Dan or Adam. Two markets or I guess a couple of markets where we're trying to focus on here is what have you seen in terms of the close to home ports recently in terms of bookings and what you've seen on the Spanish market?\nDan Hanrahan\nI can take the close to home ports. We saw some strength in the first quarter in the Caribbean on both our brands and that was helpful to be close to home. So, we were now at a point where most of our ships are leaving and for Celebrity anyway and are headed out to Europe and Alaska. I know that Royal Caribbean will still have some ships here in the Caribbean and Adam had commented on in his remarks that that was helping the overall yield. And I think I'll let Richard comment on the Spanish market.\nRichard Fain\nYeah hi, Steve. The Spanish market is probably one of the hardest hit of the many economies with which we deal. And the Spanish economy started down the recessionary path a lot earlier than everyone else that has continued there. They've just reported for the first time actual deflationary results. It was down two-tens of a percent which is pretty close zero, but those kinds of things are worrying. So there is no question that Spain is feeling the effects more than others. On the other hand because it started earlier on a comparable basis and will begin to look better before too long.\nSteven Wieczynski - Stifel Nicolaus\nOkay. Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo.\nTimothy Conder - Wachovia Wells Fargo\nThank you gentlemen. A few questions here. Can you talk little bit more on the ForEx gentlemen and balance your specific pound and euro exposure? Whether on revenues or cost or just if not specific numbers just maybe directionally there? And then relating to some of the comments regarding some of your startup brands, how do you look at those as far as timetable of investment and from a free cash basis. At what point do you do a revaluation either positively or negatively with those brands?\nDan Hanrahan\nHey Tim. I'll take the first part on FX and let I'll Richard talk about the new brands. On FX, we are long in Sterling. We are I would describe it as slightly long on Euro and we're also long on Canadian dollars. As I mentioned about a third of our revenues are now coming in among those three currencies primarily. We do have some other currencies. I think the fourth largest would be probably the Norwegian Krone.\nAnd about a quarter of our expenses are now coming in. And the expenses we have the billion fleets that's denominated in Sterling on them. We obviously have advertising expenses and what not. But in Sterling, most of our port expenses certainly Pullmantur would all be denominated in euro.\nTimothy Conder - Wachovia Wells Fargo\nOkay.\nRichard Fain\nAnd Tim with respect to startup brands, I'm not sure that there is a particular point in time at which one says you have this long three months, 12 months, whatever the period is. We look at each one individually. If you look at the strategic intentions of it and you look at whether it's moving in the right direction or not. In any event, none of them are particularly material to the overall company\nTimothy Conder - Wachovia Wells Fargo\nOkay. And then one question on guidance gentlemen in particular interest expense. Brian, can you kind of help us there? Your prior guidance for the year was 320 to 340 and you brought that range down to roughly 25 to 40 million on the high and low, a little bit of color there. And then, overall for the whole company globally, what percent of your capacity is booked at this point?\nBrian Rice\nTim on the interest expense, I think the primary benefit we've received here has been the falling interest rate, the falling LIBOR rates that have been out there. As I alluded to before we have plus or minus 10% at any point in time half of our debt is at a floating interest rate and we've benefited from that. I think we also may have some slight wins on the overall cost of some of the new financing that we had done relative to what we had baked in to the guidance.\nIn terms of percentages, we're probably, I would guess just under three quarters all land booked for the year.\nTimothy Conder - Wachovia Wells Fargo\nOkay. Great. Thank you gentlemen.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line operating Felicia Hendrix of Barclays Capital.\nFelicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital\nHi, good morning guys. Just kind of tagging onto the last question would be just under three quarters are in booked for the year. How does that compare to last year on your normal year?\nUnidentified Analyst\nSure Felecia, we certainly are as we look out into Q3 and Q4 as you would extrapolate from the graphs that we showed, we are behind by '07, '08 standards. We would be ahead of where we were. You recall when we had our fourth quarter call, we talked more about the booked loads rather than the trends. Frankly given this environment, I don't think '07, '08 is quite as comparable.\nWe're booked ahead of where we were back in '02, '03. I think what we're seeing in our modeling is that we're behaving more like we were probably back in '04 levels. And what we've tried to do is really calibrate our revenue management modeling around, what we're seeing in consumer behaviors. We try to give a low transparency into how we did in Q1, what we're seeing in Q2 and its still early but the pattern certainly seems to be developing in Q4. Frankly -- I'm sorry in Q3. Frankly Q4 would look very similar to those graphs, but we're just earlier on the booking cycle.\nFelicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital\nOkay, thanks. And then along those minds, kind of a different take on this. Where are you seeing those booking to have now in terms of how far out people are booking. I'm assuming that's getting a little bit longer often?\nBrian Rice\nWell, we actually, we looked through a lot of different sides and what to try to share this morning and we've seen certainly, if you compare the last year we have a significant greater portion booking within three months. I think if there is something encouraging in terms of where the booking curve could be going, we have seen a little bit of uptick lately in the three to six months window.\nNot a whole lot but there has been a little bit of movement there, and it's getting closer to equilibrium for the last couple of years. When you go beyond that six months market it's where we're seeing people really holding back in the high degree of uncertainty.\nFelicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital\nOkay. Dan and just switching and you had said in your prepared remarks the discounting has ramped down over the past few months and Adam also had said that. Are we still seeing a lot of efforts out there from all brands Oasis and others. Particularly which are allowing consumers to only put half of the deposits down to book?\nSo obviously we're still -- it's since is out there for people who book cruise in the resource price and these types of incentives. I'm wondering if you guys are still continuing that and also can you help us understand when the centers withstanding (ph) have been offered on the Oasis?\nDan Hanrahan\nHi Felicia.\nFelicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital\nHi.\nDan Hanrahan\nWe had our ASAP program in place for the bulk of the first quarter which offered some of the elements that you were just alluding to. Many of those we did not continue without such. But this is a very competitive market. We have commented a lot about where the rates are which is not where we would like for them to be. And so, you are going to see obviously a variety of different discounting and incentive techniques designed to compel revenue generation and all of the major brands clearly are in that game and we would expect it to be that way until the market starts to trend up and hopefully we'll be able to report that in the forthcoming quarters. But right now it's a very competitive business.\nOasis overall as I mentioned before is commanding really quite remarkable prices in the environment that we are in and it has, I think 37 different categories of state rooms although which we're managing individually by selling. So I would never say that there couldn't be a discount associated with Oasis but if you look at her performance on the whole, it's really quite spectacular at this point.\nFelicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital\nGreat. And then, Brian just on the cost side, can you just help clarify something, the guidance that you gave for costs back when you reported in the fourth quarter, did they include the same FX benefit as to what you laid out in your release this morning?\nBrian Rice\nYes. Roughly speaking, they would. What we've tried to do, we are going to continue to give you our guidance in constant dollars. I am sorry in real dollars. And we've always had that practice. But with the growth of our international business and the type of volatility that we have seen, really that began back in September.\nI think the graph that showed the Sterling having 25% tight movements within versus the second quarter last year, we just felt it was very important to not only point out how FX was impacting our revenues but that we do have a natural offset that when our yields do suffer from the -- the strengthening dollar, but we do have a natural offset on the cost side and that tends to help us maintain our operating cash flows.\nFelicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital\nOkay. What I trying to get to is also used to be prior and that cruise cost ex-fuel you are looking for down five to seven and now you are looking for down six to eight. I'm just wondering if it's fair to interpret that improvement being generated by other things that you were doing internally to cut cost or is it being driven by FX?\nBrian Rice\nThat would be predominantly because the dollar has been a little more stable since the end of January. So, what you are seeing that movement, we are comparing apples-to-apples, the five to seven, the six to eight. Most of that is being driven by the success of some of our cost management measures that we have been doing.\nFelicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital\nCan you just briefly talk about what has been the most successful and what has driven you to this new guidance?\nBrian Rice\nI think it's been an incredible effort by all our brands' management team. They have been very focused and trying to take advantage of the current environment. Just as we are seeing a lot of pricing pressures with our product, I think a lot of our vendors are seeing pricing pressure and I think our teams have done a great job of negotiating. And I think; I know Richard and I believe Adam both commented on the fact that best part of this is we are actually seeing some of the highest ratings we've ever seen from our guests.\nSo it's all been done in a very methodical way but a lot of teamwork involved in getting it done.\nFelicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital\nOkay, great. Thanks a lot guys.\nBrian Rice\nThanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Barry with Credit Suisse.\nScott Barry - Credit Suisse\nHi Brian. You indicated in the press release, you expect that billion dollars plus of operating cash flow this year. Within what seems to be an implied working capital benefit, are you assuming that customer deposits now will be neutral to positive for the full year? Thanks.\nBrian Rice\nSure Scott. Our customer deposits -- actually we hopefully are going to be filing our Q later today and you'll actually be able to see that customer deposits are down year-over-year and that's part of -- I mean it's not a large but that's all embedded within our yield guidance. And actually if you take our yield guidance, our customer deposits are actually doing better than you would infer from our revenue guidance that we have out there.\nSo, in answer to your question, we are expecting customers deposits come down slightly but most of that's being driven by the value of the FX that's out there as well as the lower yield offset in part by the higher capacity.\nScott Barry - Credit Suisse\nOkay. Okay, great. Thanks Brian.\nBrian Rice\nSure.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley - UBS\nThanks. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to ask about when you look at 2010 at the next Oasis class ship, do you expect that the financing this year is going to be kind of a template for the second ship? In other words, do you expect the 95% guarantee level and also the direct involvement from the Finnish government in terms of the financing itself or do you expect that to be replicated next year?\nBrian Rice\nRobin, I think its way too early to speculate exactly what we'll be doing. We are still more than a year and a half away from the delivery of that vessel. I think we've demonstrated by the way the Oasis came together, that we have a very good ability to go out and raise financing for these vessels. We have some excellent supporters out there and as we said with Oasis, we are not concerned about our ability to doing work.\nI don't want to get it anymore specific than that. I would like to mention though because I've seen some comments about the fact that people were surprised by the SEC participation. This was not unprecedented. We actually, when we did the financing to the Independents of the Seas, a little larger than 50% of the financing from Independents of the Seas was actually an investment on the part of the region's export credit finance group. They actually took a quite large tranch of the independence of the seas as an investment.\nAnd I believe that if you look into it, Finland in total has authorized somewhere in the neighborhood of about $3 billion of direct investment in exports in terms of providing liquidity and support of their export.\nSo this is not as unprecedented as may be some may have been hard to believe.\nRobin Farley - UBS\nAnd I think part of that comes from the discussions with management where that was kind of what was conveyed. But, okay great Thank you\nBrian Rice\nOkay.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Kent - Goldman Sachs\nHi good morning, can you guys hear me?\nBrian Rice\nYeah.\nSteven Kent - Goldman Sachs\nOkay, Well just I thought that maybe it was Adam who mentioned that for the third quarter, three quarters of the bookings or the expected bookings would come from European customers. Am I right and is that what Adam said?\nAdam Goldstein\nYes, you are correct Steve.\nSteven Kent - Goldman Sachs\nOkay. So my question then is dealing with the IATA and cost of brand through carnival (ph), they have always that the customer is very much a last minute booker. So I guess what I'm asking is so we're still pretty far away from that peak third quarter season, what's giving you the confidence in fact that that customer is going to show up since they are -- they tend to be last minute bookers?\nSecond, when you look at your Q3, Q2 essentially guidance, it still implies a massive rebound in the fourth quarter and I guess I am just trying to figure out what's in the fourth quarter other than may be slightly easier comparisons that's giving you that positive tilt?\nAnd then final question in churn, are you seeing people make deposits then block the deposits and then come back in at lower prices?\nAdam Goldstein\nSteve your first question about what is -- how we are visible is Europe for us at this point and what are our expectations about what we will happen as the season unfolds. We've been ramping up by about one ship per year and the Royal Caribbean International brand. We feel like we have a pretty solid platform for doing our revenue management analysis. We have been present in all these countries where we are marketing today. We have long term relationships with travel agents and consumers in these markets. So, we understand that there are differences. For example countries on the Mediterranean rim] we have home port products in Barcelona or Venice for example.\nWe understand that these are later booking markets and we are comparing year-over-year trends and we are getting our feedback from the market in terms of what will happen. The country directors in those markets are -- their optimism is consistent with the overall guidance that we've given its staked into that.\nIn the UK, which is a very significant market for us, the customers continue to book further out in many other countries. And so when we look at our products like Independence of the Seas which is based on South Hampton and it's an important part of our European mix. We feel like we have a pretty solid platform for projecting forward performance for the rest of the season.\nOn the other hand when we have introduced a new product for the whole summer with Vision of the Seas during shore cruises from different (inaudible) ports, there is a little bit more variability attached to that outlook. So it's all sort of baked in together and overall we feel comfortable as I mentioned in my comments that Europe is having a neutral to slightly favorable influence on our guidance as compared to three months ago.\nBrian Rice\nSteve, I will comment on your second and third question. In terms of Q4, we actually tried to spend a little bit more time on this call, really showing how we believe the evolution of the year would come about and we are looking for a better fourth quarter results than we do see in Q2 and Q3 in terms of yield performance.\nThere are really four drivers. The first you mentioned the comparable. I believe last year our yields in the fourth quarter were down right in the range of around 5.9% and if you recall when we did our third quarter earnings call we were actually projecting a yield improvement in the fourth quarter. So we did see a substantial deterioration in terms of the impact from the economy and we think we have paid a large price at that point of time.\nWe also have a significant difference from Q2 and Q3 in terms of FX. In Q2 and Q3, we're talking about 5% points of yield deterioration fully attributable to the value of the dollar or I should say the value of our foreign sales coming in. And we don't have that in Q4 right now based on the current spot rates.\nThe third thing that will really help the fourth quarter is the Caribbean. As you rightfully pointed out there is a lot more pressure on Alaska and the more high-end products. When we get back into the Caribbean in the fourth quarter, we do drive the benefits from that.\nAnd then the fourth factor while its only one month, I think the Oasis really has been an absolutely terrific product for us. There is a lot of excitement about it. If you go on the internet and compare the pricing that she's getting, it's absolutely terrific.\nAnd frankly, I think the brand is probably experiencing some degree of a halo from that vessel and is benefiting from that as well.\nOn your last question related to churn, we absolutely have seen churn. It was included in the first quarter. Frankly in our forecasting, we were expecting to actually see a little bit more churn than we have got and that was one of the benefits that we had ending up at 13.5% versus our prior guidance.\nWe've have tried to bake that into our guidance. We look at this very carefully, I think our revenue management team as Richard alluded to, really does a really thorough job in evaluating and thus far has proven proving to have a lot of creditability. And I think we have baked that all into our assumption.\nSteven Kent - Goldman Sachs\nOkay. Thank you.\nAdam Goldstein\nOkay. I guess we're running out of time, but we'll take one more question if we could operator.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\nSharon Zackfia - William Blair\nHi, good morning. I'm just curious with airfares having really retracted particularly to Europe, are you starting to see any kind of correlation and the benefit to your yield and bookings now for Europe? I know it's a little bit of a speculative question, but those airfares are dropping dramatically.\nDan Hanrahan\nSharon it's a good question. We work very, very well with our travel agent partners and rely on them heavily for our business. And we've been communicating just that same fact with them. We, as I know, charts that Brian showed you, you started to see Q2 and Q3 tick up in terms of demand. And we do think that the fact that airfares have come down probably is impacting that some what.\nSharon Zackfia - William Blair\nDo you think that's been communicated well to your potential passenger base?\nDan Hanrahan\nWell we are doing a good job giving the word out to our travel agents. We're letting them know and we're asking them to get the word out. I think travel agents are trying to get that word out of their selling cruises.\nI know when they call into us, the travel agents they are telling us that that's what they are doing. They are trying to get that word out there that airfares are down.\nSharon Zackfia - William Blair\nOkay, great. And then lastly, I guess this is always a question during times like this, are you seeing your passenger mix skew more towards weekly (ph) passengers at this point? Are you getting more first timers, people who haven't cruised before but are kind of drawn in by the low price is a good point?\nDan Hanrahan\nSharon, it's Dan again. We're seeing a fairly similar mix depending upon the brand. We haven't seen anything that's been a big, big change in terms of our mix of our guests. It'll be interesting as we go forward to see if that changes. But at this point, we're seeing fairly consistent mix.\nSharon Zackfia - William Blair\nOkay, great. Thanks.\nDan Hanrahan\nYou bet.\nBrian Rice\nOkay, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and IM will be available throughout the day if anyone has any follow-up question.\nHave a great day.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call.

My name is Melelia and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call; Mr. Jay Wilson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nJay Wilson\nGood morning everyone and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements.\nWith me today are John Hess, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President, Worldwide Exploration and Production and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI'll now turn the call over to John Hess.\nJohn Hess\nThank you, Jay and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments after which John Rielly will review our financial results.\nNet income for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.154 billion, versus $341 million a year ago. Our third quarter operating results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas selling prices and sales volumes compared to the year ago quarter.\nThis quarter's results also included an after-tax gain of $1.072 billion associated with our strategic asset trade with Shell, which closed in September as well as an after-tax charge of $347 million to write-off the West Med Block 1 concession off shore Egypt.\nExcluding these non-recurring items, exploration and production earned $552 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 413,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 2% below the year-ago period.\nLower year-over-year production resulted primarily from natural field decline to the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea and planned downtime at the Valhall field in Norway, which was partially offset by higher production from our Bakken program in North Dakota.\nCurrent net production from the Bakken is approximately 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with nine rigs working. We plan to add one additional rig in November and expect to exit this year with net production of about 20,000 barrels of oil equipment per day.\nOur acquisition of American Oil & Gas is progressing through the regulatory process and is expected to close by the end of the year. In September we closed on both the strategic asset trade with Shell and the acquisition of Total's interest in the Valhall and the Hod fields in Norway, which together raised our interest in these fields to 64.5% and 62.5% respectively.\nAlso, in September we announced the acquisition of an additional 20% interest in the Tubular Bells oil and gas field in the Gulf of Mexico from BP for $40 million. Following regulatory approval Hess will have a 40% working interest and become the operator.\nIn the United Kingdom, the sale of non-quartered, nor seen natural gas assets is now expected to close in the fourth quarter, these assets have net production of 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and year end 2009 proved reserves of 29 million barrels of oil barrel equivalent.\nWith regard to explorations we drilled two wells on our 100% owned permit WA390P in the Northwest Shelf of Australia, resulting in two discoveries. We have now completed our 16 commitment wells on the block with 13 discoveries. We have initiated an appraisal program that will continue through the middle of next year and include additional drilling and flow testing of several wells.\nCommercial discussions with potential partners regarding WA309P are ongoing. In December we expect to spud exploration wells on our 40% owned BMS-22 block in Brazil, our 100% owned Tano/Cape Three Points Block in Ghana and our 80% owned North Red Sea Block One concession in Egypt.\nIn the first quarter of 2011 we plan to drill our 100% owned semi five block in Indonesia. In terms of unconventional resources, we plan to start drilling in the EagleFord in Texas in November and in the Paris base and in France in the first quarter of 2011.\nTurning to marketing and refining, we reported a loss for the third quarter of $38 million. Refining margins weakened from last years third quarter, primarily due to lower gasoline and residual fuel oil crack spreads and higher fuel costs at our HOVENSA's joint venture refinery and lower gasoline crack spreads at our Port Reading, New Jersey facility.\nMarketing results were better than the year ago quarter, principally due improved margins in our energy marketing business. Retail gasoline volumes on a per site basis were up 1% while convenient store sales rose nearly 3%. In energy marketing natural gas sales were higher year-over-year while fuel, oil and electricity sales were lower.\nIn conclusion we are pleased with the recent transactions that we believe strengthen our global portfolio and will contribute to our Company's future reserve and production growth.\nI will now turn the call over to John Rielly.\nJohn Rielly\nThanks John. Hello everyone. In my remarks today I will compare third quarter 2010 results to the second quarter. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $1.154 billion in the third quarter of 2010, including after tax income of $725 million from items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, compared with $375 million in the second quarter.\nTuring to exploration and production, exploration and production operations had income of $1.277 billion in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $488 million in the second quarter. The third quarter results included an after tax gain of $1.072 billion relating to the exchange in the corporations interest in Gabon and the Clare Field in the United Kingdom for additional interest in the Valhall and Hod Fields in Norway.\nThe results also included an after tax charge totaling $347 million to write off our investments in the West Med Block located off shore Egypt. The impairment resulted from third quarter decision by Hess and the other concession partners to cease future exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block.\nExcluding the effect of these matters, the changes in the after tax components of the results are as follows. Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $127 million. Increased production expenses reduced earnings by $25 million. Increased exploration expenses reduced earnings by $16 million. Increased depreciation reduced earnings by $13 million. Lower selling prices decreased earnings by $6 million. All other items led to a decrease in earnings of $3 million for an overall increase in third quarter adjusted earnings of $64 million.\nThe previously mentioned exchange of the corporation's interest in Gabon and the Clair field increased our interest in the Valhall field by 28.1% and the Hod field by 25%. This exchange was accounted for its fair value and resulted in a gain in the quarter.\nIn September 2010, the corporation also completed the acquisition of a 7.85% interest in Valhall and a 12.5% interest in Hod for cash of $507 million. After completion of these acquisitions, the corporation has total interest of 64.05% in the Valhall field and 62.5% in the Hod field.\nIn the third quarter of 2010, our E&P operations were overliftsed compared with production, resulting in increased after-tax income in the quarter of approximately $60 million. The E&P effective income tax-rate was 44% in the quarter and year-to-date in 2010.\nTurning to Marketing and Refining, Marketing and Refining operations generated losses of $38 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $19 million in the second quarter. Refining operations had losses of $50 million in the third quarter and $31 million in the previous quarter.\nThe corporation's share of HOVENSA's results after income taxes was a loss of $52 million in the third quarter, compared with $4 million in the second quarter, reflecting lower refining margins in the third quarter.\nPort Reading reported income of $2 million in the third quarter, compared to a loss of $27 million in the second quarter. During the second quarter, this refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a planned turnaround. The turnaround expenses recorded in the second quarter totaled approximately $27 million after income taxes.\nMarketing earnings were $40 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $17 million in the prior quarter, principally reflecting higher electricity margins and sales volumes. Trading activities generated a loss of $28 million in the third quarter compared with $5 million in the second quarter.\nTurning to corporate, net corporate expenses were $26 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared with $42 million in the second quarter. Net corporate expenses were lower in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower bank facility fees and other general and administrative expenses.\nAfter-tax interest expense was $59 million in the third quarter, compared with $52 million in the second quarter. In August 2010, the corporation issued $1.25 billion of 30-year unsecured notes with a coupon of 5.6%.\nTurning to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter, including an increase of $136 million from changes in working capital was $1.246 billion. Net proceeds from the bond offering were $1.241 billion.\nCapital expenditures were $1.462 billion. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $35 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $990 million. We had $2.353 billion of cash and cash equivalent at September 30th 2010 and $1.362 billion at December 31st 2009.\nOur available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at September 30th 2010. Total debt was $5.584 billion at September 30th 2010 and $4.467 billion at December 31st 2009. The corporation's debt to capitalization ratio at September 30th 2010 was 26.1%, compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009.\nThis concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.\nOperator\nThank you, Ladies and gentlemen (Operators Instructions), your first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.\nEd Westlake - Credit Suisse\nHey good afternoon now. Good morning. Great results. I guess the overlifts will be a big contributor to them. I actually have two questions. One is one the EagleFord. Effectively, can you talk through your strategy there and I think on Q2 you spoke of further acquisitions in other non conventional. So perhaps a broader comment on the non conventional strategy. And then the second one is around refining. You're still obviously loosing net income. Perhaps some decisions around profit improvement or any plans on disposal. Thanks.\nGreg Hill\nYeah thanks Ed, this is Greg Hill. Let me talk about the EagleFord and then I'll talk a little bit broader about unconventional strategy. So yes we are building and have been building a position in the EagleFord. We have about 75,000 net acres as we speak under a contract and our plans are to begin drilling in November in the EagleFord and if we can get additional acreage we'll expand that position further.\nRegarding kind of broader un-conventional, as we've said before, we're really focused domestically in the U.S. in our Bakken position and the EagleFord and we have our position in the Marcellus. We continue to look for other opportunities.\nBut we're also focused internationally and of course we have our Paris face in position of about a million acres or so with our partner Toreador and we have a \u2013 we're signed a memorandum of understanding an agreement with PetroChina to look at unconventional possibilities in that Daqing field in China.\nEd Westlake - Credit Suisse\nThank you.\nGreg Hill\nTerms of refining, specifically HOVENSA, we're disappointed with the operating performance of the facility as well as the financial performance and we are working with our partners to find ways to improve both.\nEd Westlake - Credit Suisse\nIs there anything, any specific plans or an announcement that you can make in there or is this just ongoing?\nGreg Hill\nIt's ongoing.\nEd Westlake - Credit Suisse\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Paul Shankey from Deutsche Bank.\nPaul Shankey - Deutsche Bank\nGood morning gentlemen, I guess if we could talk a bit more about the Bakken please, could you just update us at a high level firstly, I guess there an implicate increase to your production target there, that once you've completed American oil and gas certainly and I wanted to clear if there maybe will show up with pressure from the kind of performance your getting out of our activities there.\nIf you could kind of address the high level question also talk more about all the technical things that you're doing and the progress that your making out of the time, thank you.\nGreg Hill\nYeah, thanks Paul. This is Greg. Well, first of all, I mean, we were on track in the Bakken. We continue to make significant progress. We are on track to exit the year at a net record rate of about 20,000 barrels a day. As we said, we are marching our way towards 80,000 barrels a day in our existing position in the Bakken.\nRegarding the American Oil & Gas position, of course we have not yet acquired that. We are optimistic that that will close. But it's early days. We would like to get few wells in the ground before we issue any additional production guidance associated with that. But obviously we are excited about the acreage. Otherwise, we would have never acquired it.\nJust briefly on, you know, well cost are coming in at about $11 million each for a dual lateral EURs, of about a million barrels per dual and our 30-day average IP rate's are around the order of 400 to 500 barrels per day per lateral from 18 stage fracs. Well, that gives you kind of an overall update of the Bakken.\nPaul Shankey - Deutsche Bank\nGreat, thanks. And one more from me. The Western Meds write-downs, I know you were bit surprised by that, could you just explain what that was about?\nGreg Hill\nSure. While we did have several natural gas discoveries on the block, based on the technical working and working with our partners, the quantities of gas found are not sufficient to pursue a commercial development at this time. So, during the quarter, actually, late in the quarter, the partners decided to cease future exploration activities on the block again, just from the risks of some of the plays and the ability to make it commercial. And Hess has actually have now decided to relinquish a significant portion of the block. So, as a result of that decision by the partnership group, just following the GAAP Accounting Standards, we have to take an impairment in this quarter.\nPaul Shankey - Deutsche Bank\nRight. And in case, are there any other Egyptian updates to give us?\nGreg Hill\nThe only thing from -- in North Red Sea, John Hess has mentioned that we will be drilling an exploration well there in the North Red Sea. And so that is coming up right now in the fourth quarter. Outside of that, nothing else.\nPaul Shankey - Deutsche Bank\nFinally, can you give us a sense of the prospect there? Alright.\nGreg Hill\nYes. So, in the Northern Red Sea, this is Block 1 where we have an 80% working interest with the operator. It is a Cretaceous sandstone play to the tune of about 710 meters of water. It's going to take about 90 days to drill and it's an oil prospect and we're looking for oil.\nPaul Shankey - Deutsche Bank\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch\nThank you. Good morning, gentlemen.\nGreg Hill\nGood morning.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch\nCouple of things from me. Just going to the exploration program, 100% in Ghana, 100% in Semai, 80% in Egypt, and a whole bunch of gas in Australia that doesn't have a home yet. Can you just talk about strategically how you might think about perhaps cross border asset swaps? And perhaps in light of your recent commentary that you may not drill some of these wells with such high interest in the future. That was my first and I have a follow up, please.\nGreg Hill\nYeah, thanks Doug. I think, you know, our strategy is to acquire opportunities of high working interest. And as we de-risk the wells, then we make a separate decision of whether or not we are going to farm down or not. I think. In Ghana, in Semai, we are in active discussion with a number of potential partners for farming offers and I think, you know, assuming we get an acceptable view; we will probably farm down both of those wells to drill. You mentioned Australia as well. I mean, obviously, we are not going to build L&G plants in Australia. So we will likely take a partner on our 100% position in Australia as well linked to the liquefaction round.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch\nGreg, should we expect the farm-down of Ghana given that it's going to slide through pretty quickly, might be related to in someway to accelerating your place in the queue for LNG in Australia. Are the two linked or that completely separate in terms of your partner negotiations.\nGreg Hill\nNo I wouldn't say they are necessarily linked Doug. I mean some of the partners we are talking to had positions in Australia and so we are talking to about number potential cross border deals or just straight promote.\nDoug Leggate - BAS-ML\nWould the same apply to Egypt? Would you expect to farm that down as well or will you drill 80%?\nGreg Hill\nWe have already farmed 20% down to premier and so I think we will continue to look for partners here as well.\nDoug Leggate - BAS-ML\nOkay, two other quick ones from me, if I may. Just jumping back to the EagleFord, can you tell us where exactly your acreage is in terms of counties, oil/gas window, that kind of stuff? Basically what is your plan for the rig count there? You gave us a pretty clear signal as what you were going to do in the Bakken. But on the on the EagleFord, what is your drilling plan and potential ramp up that we should expect over the next year?\nGreg Hill\nIt's early days in the EagleFord I guess what I will say is we are firmly in a condensate window and our plan is to drill six wells starting in November just to being accessing the acreage after that then we will make a decision on how to expand the ramp up after we get those initial six wells drilled.\nDoug Leggate - BAS-ML\nGreat, and the last one from me, this one is maybe for Mr. Hess. The Bakken and the Valhall deals appear to give you a pretty good anchor on your 3% growth targets but that doesn't include obviously incremental interest in Tubular Bells, the potential pony development. Can you speak to how you are thinking about your production guidance or longer-term targets now that those deals are being done?\nJohn Hess\nGood question Doug and basically it's bizarre, investment program in the Bakken and now having captured larger interest in Valhall that also has incremental production over the next five years. We feel pretty good that both of those assets were underpinned a minimum of 3% production growth in oil equipment over the next five years.\nSo, that's the way you think about our production guidance but that really is a minimum and then as you rightfully point out as the Gulf of Mexico regulatory environment gets clarified hopefully we will be able to sanction both the pony and Tubular Bells developments that would be incremental to our picture. As well as hopefully some success either in other unconventional that Greg is talking about or some of the exploratory prospects that we have longer term. So we feel we have acquired a lot of attractive growth options. Some of them will not be successful but hopefully some will. And that would be incremental to the minimum 3% production growth guidance.\nDoug Leggate - BAS-ML\nThanks. Would that also apply to the American Oil & Gas? Is that also added to it?\nJohn Hess\nI think the best way to look at American Oil & Gas, that's incremental but on the margin. So, it's definitely supportive of that minimum 3% growth guidance.\nDoug Leggate - BAS-ML\nI will leave it there. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman from Benchmark & Co.\nMark Gilman - Benchmark & Co.\nGuys, good morning. Hey, Greg, with respect to the parameters on the Bakken which you outlined before, give me an idea if you would whether that represents an average-to-date and what it looks like from a trend or most current standpoint?\nGreg Hill\nYeah, I think on those well results that I quoted, you know, that's an average-to-date based on the results that we've seen. And I think the only change that we're seeing in the short-term is we're going to 22 stage fracs. That's our current design. The averages I quoted to you were based on 18 stage fracs. So there will be a little uplift in those as we go 22 stage.\nMark Gilman - Benchmark & Co.\nGreg, while I have you, perhaps you could help me to understand the Tubular Bells transaction. I guess I don't quite understand the nominal consideration. I don't quite understand BP divesting a small portion of it but retaining an interest. A little bit hard for me to relate to exactly what's going on there and what your expectations are. Some comment would be appreciated.\nGreg Hill\nI think, you know, in terms of Tubular Bells, obviously, BP is restructuring a business globally, post-Macondo. And so, this presented us with an opportunity to increase our interest and become operator of the asset. So, we like Tubular Bells or our partner like Tubular Bells, obviously, BP likes Tubular Bells because they wanted to retain an interest in it. You know, I wouldn't say anything more than that. It's just them restructuring their portfolio.\nMark Gilman - Benchmark & Co.\nThe development history there, Greg, has been -- or the appraisal history I guess I should say has been a bit mixed. Has there been a downgrade in your mind in terms of the resource potential?\nGreg Hill\nI think what we've said about Tubular Bells before is we see it in the excess of 100 million barrels and we'll provide some additional information post sanction on the volume size.\nMark Gilman - Benchmark & Co.\nThat's a gross number, I assume?\nGreg Hill\nYeah, gross.\nMark Gilman - Benchmark & Co.\nOkay. Just one more from me. Regarding European gas, give me an idea if you could in rough terms how much you sell spot versus how much is under contract? And also any portion that may be specifically linked in one way shape or form to crude oil and/or petroleum product prices?\nJohn Rielly\nYes. So, basically, you've got to a mix when you're looking at Europe, between UK, Norway and Denmark. Pretty much, the majority of our production is coming out of the UK and that is being sold at spot prices. In Norway and Denmark, there you have contractual terms to it. It does have some linkage then to the oil markets.\nMark Gilman - Benchmark & Co.\nThanks, John.\nJohn Rielly\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.\nEvan Calio - Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Good quarter. Exciting exploration calendar into 2011. I guess I have two follow-up questions, one for Greg on the Red Sea. Any pre-drill range there or a description more of what the play type is? If you guys are doing a two-well program, are those back to back wells that you are thinking right now?\nGreg Hill\nYeah, again, Evan, the Northern Red Sea block, it's a cretaceous sandstone play, that's the first well. We believe it's an oil, it will be an oil prospect and the prospect size is on the order of 100 to 200 million barrels. The second oil a bit dependent on the first well, we do plan drill the second well but the location to that well will depends on what happens with the first well.\nEvan Calio - Morgan Stanley\nOkay, so which same play type then?\nGreg Hill\nAgain, it depends on the results of the first well.\nEvan Calio - Morgan Stanley\nUnderstood, okay. And then a follow-up if I could also on the part of question on the farm-down, it's just a general understand. I fully appreciate your accessing all the opportunities for this, is it goal, it sounds as goal and a potential swap to remain exploration neutral if you would meaning to swap interest in other projects or is that \u2013 can we think about that way?\nGreg Hill\nI think you shouldn't assume that is a general rule. It depends on the well; it depends on the packing column and promotional risk profile of the well. Sometimes we'll pay cash in the form of a promote and or international swap and so it depends well by well.\nEvan Calio - Morgan Stanley\nOkay, it's good. That's the information. Thanks guys.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.\nArjun Murti - Goldman Sachs\nThank you. Just a couple of follow-ups. On the Australia commercial timing, can we think about that as first half of \u201811 or is there did you want to do some of the appraisal work first?\nJohn Hess\nYeah, thanks Arjun. I think what we want to do is we want to do the appraisal work. You need to get some critical well data during the appraisal say the key for long-term development planning and pipeline design and those kinds of things. As we said before in parallel we're actually with the commercial side, the liquefaction route, so hopefully by the middle of 2011, we'll be in a position to pick a route. We have significant part of our appraisal program done and then can make and form decision around sanction.\nArjun Murti - Goldman Sachs\nAnd the options, there are still Floating LNG which show, which I put out to and which show another three possibilities for you?\nJohn Hess\nYeah, with the other possibility at Northwest Shelf.\nArjun Murti - Goldman Sachs\nOkay, Northwest Shelf, this one is great.\nJohn Hess\nBut it always \u2013 it comes available sometime in the future.\nArjun Murti - Goldman Sachs\nThank you. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that might have been \u2013 John has the China, PetroChina memorandum of understanding, can you just elaborate what that opportunity is that dodging in terms of pursuing presumably shale oil opportunities there? \nJohn Hess\nYeah, we signed a joint study agreement with PetroChina and basically it's a tight oil zone in the Daqing field. That potentially by applying Bakken-like technology you can unlock. So that's currently what we're looking at.\nArjun Murti - Goldman Sachs\nThat's great and presumably the memorandum of understanding for specifically that zone is supposed to an overall interest in the field or anything greater than that. \nJohn Hess\nYes, it is. It's just specific to the tighter oil zone in the Daqing field.\nArjun Murti - Goldman Sachs\nThat's great. And just the final question in terms of what you think is realistic timing to getting back to exploration in the Gulf of Mexico given the listing of the moratorium but obviously there are permitting questions and so forth?\nJohn Hess\nGood question, Arjun.\nArjun Murti - Goldman Sachs\nThank you, everyone in the industry is asking that. As you know there's still a lot of uncertainty both regulatory and legislatively like what's coming at us so even though there's more moratorium has been listed, we're still kind of mid cycle I guess in terms of regulatory and legislative understanding of what's going to happen. I think for planning purposes we're hoping to go back to work in the Gulf of Mexico in the middle of 2011 sometime but that's just a planning assumption at this point.\nArjun Murti - Goldman Sachs\nThat's great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nHey guys.\nGreg Hill\nHi\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nGood morning. A number of quick questions hopefully. Greg based on what you said, presumably that the Pony appraisal well is not going to be drilled in December. And in terms of the process of the unitization with Knotty Head, do you guys have to wait until you finish the last appraisal well and they finish there? Or that you can still go ahead and try to unitize and maybe have a cost that after the last appraisal well make an adjustment. How does that process work?\nJohn Hess\nYeah, let me give you a quick update, Paul, on just where we are. So, we continue to make significant progress towards sanction of Pony, so we just signed a letter of agreement, a confidentiality agreement and a data trade agreement with the Knotty Head partners. So, the next step now is negotiate the JOA, which should be completed early next year. Obviously, the timing of the sanction is uncertain due to the permitting delays, but specifically due the Pony 3 well. We intend to get back to Pony 3 as soon as we can obtain the permit from the BOEM and we are in the process of filing all that paper work as we speak. And so, really, just for a planning assumption we're assuming that we can get back to Pony 3 sometime in the second half of 2011. Now that doesn't mean we're still not pursuing doing all the design work, the feed work, progressing the JOA, you know, with partners, all those things to move Pony forward.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nRight. So in other words, we should not assume that just because you couldn't drill on that last appraisal well that you are in a holding pattern. You are still moving forward and there is a possibility that you may be able to finalize and done much of that even before the last appraisal well.\nJohn Hess\nAbsolutely, we're moving forward, so all of that stuff happens in parallel.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nOkay, and in the -- normally you guys don't give any guidance on the next year production and CapEx until after you report the fourth quarter. Is there any kind of rough direction that you can give us in terms of up, down, flat?\nJohn Rielly\nNo, Paul. I think you said it. I mean, we're still in the process of going through all that now and looking at the program for next year and so we will update the guidance in our January call.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nOkay and for 2010 production given the strong results in the third quarter, should we assume there's going to be closer to the high-end of the range instead of the middle of the range?\nJohn Rielly\nYes. Given the results to-date and actually somewhat later than expected timing of the closing of our UK North Sea natural gas asset sale, we will be at the upper end of our range.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nOkay. After you complete the acquisition of the American Oil & Gas, in theory, you had 13 rigs. Are you guys going to stick to the 13 rigs or are you scaling back down to the 10 rigs and just stick with that $1 billion a year kind of capital spending program?\nGreg Hill\nPaul, the American Oil & Gas will be incremental. We've planned to develop that with the 3 rig program. So, we will be up to the 13 rig program. So, we won't dial back in.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nThe quality -- I know that it's a little bit premature. Can we somewhat using a prorated -- I am seeing that if you are looking for adding about 15,000 barrels per day using a 10 rig program a year when you use that 13 rig rates that that would be closer to 20,000 barrels per day increase? In other words that the quality of the American Oil & Gas, should we assume that it would be somewhat similar to the area that you are working on today?\n\nGreg Hill\nYeah, so I think Paul I think it's real all related, figure out what American Oil & Gas is going to provide or whether it's you can scale it or whatever. So let's get if you will down and we will provide that formal update on that what's going to deliver for us.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nOkay, a final question on Bakken. With the Alberta Creeper and the Keystone is up and running, it seems like we have more pipeline capacity than the Canadian heavy oil that is currently available. Is there any opportunity for you guys to ship or to utilize those pipes for Bakken so that narrow the Bakken discount?\nJohn Hess\nPaul, a couple of dimensions there. First, we have tradition of marketing agreements. Number one, with pipelines in the area; number two, we're putting in a way of facility which will give us a lot of flex; number three, we're working with Enbridge on this new pipeline expansion that they have. So those are the sort of the three options that we're doing that should be able to accommodate the production growth that we envision over the next five or six years.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.\nBlake Fernandez - Howard Weil\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Had a question for you on the Paris Basin. Originally I guess I was thinking the testing would begin in the fourth quarter. It sounds like you mentioned the first quarter of '11 you would begin drilling. Any sense of when we might have a kind of final determination on whether that play is going to be economical or not?\nGreg Hill\nYeah, thanks again. What we can say at this point is that sometime in 2011, because we will start drilling our first wells in early 2011 and we'll have, certainly have some indication of the commerciality of the play in 2011.\nBlake Fernandez - Howard Weil\nOkay, back to the Bakken. I know there's been some discussion whether the dual completions are the way to go or not. It sounds, Greg, to me like you are still comfortable with that and confident that that is the way that Hess is going to continue to pursue the play, right?\nGreg Hill\nYes, we are.\nBlake Fernandez - Howard Weil\nOkay, then the final one from me is on the cost in EagleFord. I am just curious if you're providing any costs on what you are paying per acre out there?\nJohn Rielly\n\nNo, we're not. Obviously, that's fairly competitively sensitive.\nBlake Fernandez - Howard Weil\nSure. Okay, I'll figure out that, thanks.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.\nPavel Molchanov - Raymond James\nThanks for taking my question guys. First on Thanks for taking my question, guys. First on pre-drill reserve estimates, I appreciate you sharing that for the Red Sea. I wanted to see if I can get you to give those numbers also for the next BMS-22 prospect and/or for Ghana?\nJohn Hess\nNo, we typically don't do that. So no, I'm not going to give you those estimates.\nPavel Molchanov - Raymond James\nOkay, no problem. And then another follow-on on the Paris Basin. If you move to full-scale development down the road, are there any infrastructure kind of off take capacity issues that would potentially slow you down? I guess I am trying to get a sense of when production there could begin to move the needle for you guys.\nJohn Hess\nI think on the Paris Basin, it's still early days. We've got to drill our first well so you can see there's a commercial development there. There is existing capacity in the Basin. They have a refinery near by. And so obviously, before we enter the play, we look at those things and don't seems as a significant constraint at this point.\nPavel Molchanov - Raymond James\nVery good, I appreciate it.\nOperator\nYour next question is a follow up question from the line of Mark Gilman from Benchmark.\nMark Gilman - Benchmark & Co.\nJohn, I wonder, could you provide some volume number to that overlifts and give me a rough idea where?\nJohn Rielly\nSure, Mark. It was a 2.1 million barrel overlifts in the quarter. It was primarily EG to about 1.1 million barrels. And then the UK and Gabon, both at around 500,000.\nMark Gilman - Benchmark & Co.\nOkay. And just one other one for Greg. Greg, it was my recollection that upon the completion of the 16-well program on your 100% block on the northwestern shelf you would be in a position to give us some kind of resource indication. Can you help us out in that regard?\nGreg Hill\nYeah, Mark. I think, I will rather wait until I get my appraisal program done to do that.\nMark Gilman - Benchmark & Co.\nOkay. We will wait with interest. Thanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kate Minyard from JPMorgan.\nKate Minyard - JPMorgan\nHi, good morning.\nOperator\nYes, we can hear you.\nKate Minyard - JPMorgan\nGreat, thanks. Just a quick question on Brunei. Just given your interest in Block Ca1, I was wondering if you could give us any color on just timing? It looks like the operator is eager to start drilling in a short period of time. Was just wondering if you had any insight into whether that was early 2011 or is it a bit too early to tell? Thanks.\nJohn Hess\nObviously, a little context about Brunei first. We are really excited about the prospectively of that block. And as we mentioned, the partnerships in the process of developing a work plan and we expect drilling on the block to begin and mid-2011.\nKate Minyard - JPMorgan\nOkay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.\nEd Westlake - Credit Suisse\nYes, just probably a very early number and you probably actually can't answer this, but if you were thinking about just the sort of resource potential of the Paris Basin or Daqing, what kind of order of magnitude if there's modest success or risked outcome do you think the reserves could be?\nGreg Hill\nEd, it's too early. You know, we need to get a few wells in the ground and complete our joint study with PetroChina before we can give any kind of estimates for that.\nEd Westlake - Credit Suisse\nAnd in the Paris Basin?\nGreg Hill\nYeah, the same. I mean, we don't even have a well in the ground yet. So, let's wait till we get some wells in the ground.\nEd Westlake - Credit Suisse\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur final question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nJohn, when you're talking about the overliftss, at the end of September, are we neutral or still underlift or overlift in the inventory?\nJohn Rielly\nLet's just first talk about for the year. We actually, still are in a underlift position of 1.2 million barrels in the year. So, we had some significant underlifts in the first and second quarter. But some of that again was just the catch up. So, I am again looking at the inventories, I think we are fairly balanced at this point right now.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nSo we should not assume that any meaningful (inaudible) in the fourth quarter unless the schedule change?\nJohn Rielly\nNo. I would not assume any. Obviously, the scheduling, the timing at quarter end, things can change. But I would not assume anything in there.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nOkay, Greg, maybe I missed it. You are saying that -- obviously you guys are not going to build the LNG plant yourself. Is that -- when you are looking at trying to monetize the discovery over there, is that the preferred way that whatever is the option you choose, you're going to be that have a proportion equity ownership in the LNG train? Or that you want to just to be a strict long-term supply contract with no equity in the LNG train?\nGreg Hill\nYeah, I wouldn't make the assumption that we will necessarily have equity in the LNG plant. It could be a tariffing arrangement or whatever, so that is all part of the commercial mix.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nBut I mean from the Company's standpoint, is that one that's more preferable than the other?\nGreg Hill\nIt really just stands upon the commercial deal that we strike, yeah.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nOkay, and then a final one on the BMS-22 in Ghana. How important is the next exploration well to determine whether you are going to stick to the broad and continue to do additional drilling in the future or that to the demand that if that turns out to be dry, that means that you guys the interest in those probably would be substantially reduced. So I'm trying to understand that you already map our additional prospect that you could be interested with Ghana on the success or not on the next well.\nGreg Hill\nWhen you talk about Ghana, since you mentioned both, so in Ghana, it is a large block, we see multiple play types on the block, both structural and stratigraphic. Therefore, I think the outcome of one well will not be conclusive for the block or you can assume it will probably be drilled at least one more well on Ghana. Regarding Brazil, I think we just have to see the result of the well and then figure out where we go from there.\nPaul Cheng - Barclays Capital\nOkay, very good. Thank you.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session for today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

Thank you all for joining us on the webcast. We appreciate your interest in Walmart. I know the executive team looks forward to sharing their strategies with you and answering your questions.\nNow, let me get a few of our usual statements out of the way. The information presented at today's meeting should be viewed in conjunction with our press release and earnings materials that can be found on our website, stock.walmart.com. The presentations will also be posted on our website as they are completed.\nToday's presentations include forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. Please reference our entire Safe Harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations which are included with our earnings materials on our website, stock.walmart.com. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our earnings materials and guidance issued this morning.\nYou can see today's agenda on your screen, and in a moment Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO will share some initial thoughts with you about our culture, our people and our opportunities. And then he'll be back to discuss Walmart's strategic objectives after you hear from our CFO, Brett Biggs. Brett will discuss Q4 results and fiscal year 2022 guidance and then we'll conduct our first of two Q&A sessions today.\nWe'll have a brief 10 minute break following the Q&A session and then you will hear from several other leaders who will discuss our priorities and strategies across the business. Following these presentations, we will have another brief break and then we will conduct our second Q&A session. And at the end of that session, our formal meeting will conclude.\nWith that, let's get things started.\nDoug McMillon\nHello, everyone and thank you for joining us for our 2021 investment community meeting. We are grateful for your interest in our company and for the confidence so many of you have in our future. We believe that confidence is well-founded and we are excited to give you an update on the opportunities we see ahead.\nI've been a part of Walmart for more than 30 years now and I can't remember a time when there was so much exciting change happening inside our company. The world around us is changing in big and important ways and I'm so encouraged by how our associates are leading and embracing change.\nWe have a blend of experience and new thinking that are coming together to allow us to execute with more creativity and speed. We aren't the business we were just a few years ago, and we aren't the business you'll see in the years ahead; we are moving.\nDavid Glass was a CEO that followed Sam Walton. He led us into the food business and got us started outside the United States. In the 1990s I remember him telling us repeatedly that the company was just getting started. Every time I would hear him say it, I would think, really? We were already large by then, and so much had already happened.\nBut today I can tell our associates the same thing; there is so much opportunity still in front of us. We have the talent, the culture, and the assets to thrive in the next generation of retail to invent it. We\u2019ve been building for this moment, and the moment is here. It's up to us. We can make it true that in 2021 this company was just getting started.\nI know many of you have been investing in and following Walmart for a long time and you know a lot about our company. This is a different business today and we are just getting started; we are moving.\nLooking back at 2020, I\u2019m so proud of how our big team has responded to the challenges. They just keep stepping up. It feels like our customers' and society have come to appreciate our associates more than usual, and that\u2019s well deserved. So many have been selfless and courageous.\nWe\u2019ve tried to show our frontline associates in our stores, clubs, and supply chain our respect and gratitude with our words and our actions. They, along with our customers, our shareholders, our suppliers and partners, the communities we serve and the planet we seek to strengthen, shape our decisions. We take a multi stakeholder view because we know that mindset and approach deliver the most valuable, sustainable business over time.\nAs for today, Brett will join us in a moment to talk about our results for the fourth quarter as well as to provide an outlook on our expectations for the next few years. I'll come back after his remarks to talk through the acceleration of our strategy and how we will deliver sustainable long-term growth. Then you will hear from several of our leaders about the specifics of our plan.\nI\u2019m confident you will leave this session with a clear understanding of a few key points. First, innovation and speed. It's time for us to dial-up our aggressiveness even more and go faster. Walmart is in a position of strength and we have momentum. Our confidence in our plan motivates us to accelerate and we will walk you through why we feel that way.\nSecond, we are building a new customer-centric business model. Our customers welcome us serving them in new ways, and our assets and capabilities are being monetized in ways we haven't tapped into before. We have assets to leverage like our stores and supply chain, strengths like our store traffic and a brand trusted for value.\nWe have foundational cornerstones like EDLP and EDLC. We can stay true to who we are and build on our strengths while building a mutually reinforcing flywheel. We are starting to drive the top and bottom line in more expansive ways. Our bottom line is becoming more diversified, which will enable us more operating income growth over time. We are repositioning to be in different businesses and exiting some geographies so resources are shifted to our priorities. We are building a better model, and it's uniquely Walmart.\nThird we will continue designing this business to create shared value for all our stakeholders. We are out to demonstrate that our company can do even more good for people as we grow; communities are strengthened, customers, associates, shareholders and suppliers benefit. Everyone wins. I will be back to share more specifics on the strategy in a few minutes.\nNow I would like to welcome Brett to add his view on the quarter and the future. Brett?\nBrett Biggs\nGood morning and thanks, Doug. I\u2019ve been with Walmart for more than two decades and this is one of the most challenging and unique times we've all faced. However, it's also a time that presents great opportunities, and I'm looking forward to highlighting some of those for you this morning, I'm so proud of how our associates have responded in serving customers while accelerating our strategy.\nThe recent progress in transforming Walmart into a truly omni-channel business prepared us for this period and it helped shape our future. This is an important moment for Walmart and we are ready.\nThere are several things I want you to take away from this morning. First, we have great momentum. We just completed a year with record sales of $560 billion in constant currency including record fourth quarter sales of more than $150 billion and record operating cash flow of $36 billion. Profit growth was also strong, thanks to a number of things; strong sales, in particular improving general merchandise sales, improving eCommerce margins, and improved margin mix overall.\nCertainly we had tailwinds during the year, but we are performing extraordinarily well. This strong performance has allowed us to invest in the future of the business, invest in our associates, and give good returns to shareholders. From a position of great strength, we are now going to accelerate investments in supply chain, technology, automation, and our associates, allowing us to stay ahead of shifts in customer behavior.\nWe strongly believe these investments will accelerate the company's top line and profit growth in the mid to long-term. Active portfolio management is also strengthening the model and focusing resources. And we remain laser focused on operating efficiency and delivering sustainable expense leverage.\nSo let's turn to highlights of the fourth quarter and the year. During the year, we saw elevated sales levels related to customers stocking up, eating at home, entertaining and educating at home, and investing in home decor or their yards. And of course those things were supported by stimulus spending. In parallel, we had incremental COVID costs, some of which will continue.\nWe had a strong holiday season followed by an acceleration in January. Total constant currency revenue was strong, increasing more than $10 billion for the quarter and $40 billion for the year. Walmart U.S. comp sales excluding fuel grew 8.6% in both Q4 and for the year, including 79% annual growth in eCommerce. Walmart U.S. grew net sales by $29 billion for the year. Now for context, that is similar to the annual revenue of Dollar General and Starbucks.\nSam's Club wrapped up a terrific year with full year comp sales growth of 15.8%, excluding fuel and tobacco and membership income increased more than 9%. On its own, Sam's Club would rank near the top 50 in the Fortune 500. Outside the US, sales increased 6.3% in constant currency for the quarter, including 60% eCommerce growth with strength in India, Mexico and Canada. Seven of nine markets posted positive comp sales, and for the year international net sales grew more than $6 billion in constant currency.\nAdjusted operating income on a constant currency basis declined about 3% in the quarter and was pressured by more than a $1 billion of incremental COVID expenses including associate bonuses, as well as a charge of around $220 million related to a decision to repay U.K property tax relief granted earlier in the year.\nThe fourth quarter also included some increased tech expenses and increased wage pressure related to recently announced structure changes in Walmart U.S., as well as additional head count to ensure our holiday season was a success, which it was. Excluding the U.K charge, total company adjusted operating income would have increased.\nDespite various headwinds, Walmart U.S. adjusted operating income increased 6.5% on solid gross margin improvement and continued reduction in eCommerce losses, as well as some benefit related to timing of allocations. For the year, adjusted operating income increased over 9% in constant currency with each segment growing significantly despite more than $4 billion of incremental COVID costs.\nQ4 adjusted EPS was $1.39, but would have been about $0.37 higher if not for COVID costs and the U.K property tax repayment. GAAP EPS was a $0.74 loss, significantly impacted by the loss on businesses in the U.K and Japan as both are classified as assets held for sale that's partially offset by an unrealized gain in our investment in JD.com, the value of which has increased by $9 billion since our initial investment.\nOperating cash flow for the year was exceptionally strong at $36 billion, and the company returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. So in summary, it was a great year financially and on an underlying basis, it was a strong finish.\nLet's now talk about how we plan to continue the strong momentum. Because of our financial strength, competitive position and ability to execute, we're in a unique position to continue innovating and serving customers in multiple ways. Over the past several years we've made great progress building an ecosystem of synergistic assets, and we've made strategic choices like reducing exposure to lower growth international markets while focusing on higher growth opportunities in the U.S., Mexico, and India.\nNow is the time to play even more aggressive offense. We are winning, and we intend to keep pushing the ball aggressively down the field. Over the next few years we are going to step up capital investment primarily in the U.S to improve the customer experience, support growth, and drive efficiencies. I will give you some highlights and you will hear more as the morning progresses.\nAs I mentioned earlier, our revenue grew $40 billion last year, putting us at least a year ahead of where we thought we might be. So we need to lean in more aggressively in key markets with increased capital and fulfillment capacity, supply chain, automation, and technology. This new infrastructure will allow us to expand eCommerce assortment, enabling us to reduce both shipping time and cost.\nWe will step up automation in DCs to deliver aisle and department-ready pallets, stores. We will continue to refresh our existing stores by enhancing pickup and delivery capacity, merchandising programs and efficiency initiatives.\nIn India we see significant growth opportunities for Flipkart and PhonePe. It's exciting to see the emerging middle class rapidly adopting eCommerce and using their mobile phones to use money transfer, insurance, and other services. Meanwhile, we will step up technology investments to continue upgrading legacy enterprise systems and customer facing technology. We are on a multiyear journey of modernizing our tech stack and capabilities to increase the efficient use of the cloud and simplify customer and associate experiences.\nAs we accelerate investment, CapEx is expected to be around $14 billion this year with most of the increase versus last year in the U.S. Over the next few years, we expect CapEx to be around 2.5% to 3% of sales. While this is higher than the past few years, it is far below the CapEx peak of 4% to 5% of sales during the period of heavy supercenter growth. This spend will allow us to fully optimize our strategy, and in turn accelerate the company's top line and profit growth rates in the mid to long-term.\nAfter a year or so of transition, these investments should put us in position for 4% plus sales growth and operating income growth rates higher than sales. 4% top line growth would basically be the equivalent of adding a Fortune 100 company every year. Our unique financial strength allows us to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders while growing the business.\nAnd as you saw this morning, we increased our dividend for the 48th consecutive year and we authorized a new $20 billion share repurchase program, which we plan to execute over the next three years or so. There are so many initiatives underway that give us confidence that these are the right investments at the right time. We are already seeing proof points, and you'll hear more about these later on.\nWe expect continued strong growth in the U.S businesses and expect even higher international growth rates as we focus on key markets and making money in new ways. We will continue improving margin mix through an enhanced general merchandise offering, new brands and marketplace growth with a greater push towards expanding fulfillment and other services for sellers.\nWe will drive existing and new customer growth through initiatives like Walmart+. We will grow sales and profit increasingly with growing higher margin businesses in advertising, financial services, marketplace, health care services and the like. Our operating discipline will continue to sharpen. After a pause in FY '22 primarily because of additional wage investments, I expect expense leverage to continue at or above 20 basis points a year.\nLet me turn now specifically to our expectations for this current year. We feel very good about the underlying business and ability to compete from a position of strength. However, we are still facing similar COVID-related challenges, absolutely have over the past several quarters which caused us to suspend guidance, and continues to make short-term guidance very challenging.\nDespite that we want to give you the best view we can at this time given what we know and what we see right now. We know we will have both headwinds and tailwinds this year, the balance and degree of which isn't clear. As the year progresses, we hope to get more clarity around COVID impacts, vaccine efficacy and availability, the scale and duration of economic stimulus and the mid-term economic climate globally.\nEven if conditions stay generally similar to now, for any length of time this year and with limited additional stimulus, we would expect continued solid underlying performance from Walmart U.S. with low single-digit comps and continued solid eCommerce sales growth. Low single-digit comps would result in around a 10% comp growth on a 2-year stack basis. So, very healthy growth.\nWe would expect the level of comp growth to be more heavily weighted toward the middle of the year as a result of the timing of COVID-related demand and stimulus in FY '21. Now of course that could look different depending on future stimulus and/or significant changes in customer spending patterns as the COVID crisis hopefully moderates at some point.\nThe comparisons against last year are unique. There were stretches that were really strong and others less so, driven by how people responded to the virus, how they stocked up, how they responded to being at home more, and of course stimulus actions.\nIn International, excluding divestitures, we expect to see higher level of sales growth versus the U.S with strength in India, Mexico, and China. And at Sam's we expect low single-digit comps, excluding fuel and tobacco.\nTotal company sales are expected to decline, due primarily to the divestiture or anticipated divestitures of businesses in the U.K., Japan, and Argentina. Excluding that, we would expect total company sales to grow in the low single digits. From a profitability standpoint, given the assumptions mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of divestitures, we would expect operating income and EPS to be flat to up slightly versus a very strong profit year in FY '21.\nIn regards to the U.K transaction, when we announced it, we said we expected EPS dilution of approximately $0.25 in the first full year assuming we held proceeds in cash. We expect to hold more cash than normal during this time due to strong cash flow, but plan to reallocate that cash in a thoughtful way in the coming quarters into new projects as well as share repurchase.\nWe still expect to make up for the EPS hit in the mid-term, but there will be timing impacts that negatively affect FY 2022 EPS by about $0.20. However, this should provide a tailwind to EPS growth in future years as we reallocate more of that cash. Due in large part to the International transactions, we expect operating income dollars and EPS to decline slightly in FY '22 on a consolidated basis, but we expect Walmart U.S. operating income to increase in spite of some continued COVID costs, accelerated technology costs and increased wages.\nAlternative revenue streams like advertising and Walmart Fulfillment Services are gaining traction and are expected to become a larger portion of profit growth in the future including FY '22 along with a fairly steady gross margin rate. Due to the International transactions and FY '21 COVID-related expense and profit timing, we expect the FY '22 quarterly profit growth cadence versus last year to be quite variable.\nWe expect Q1 operating income to be relatively flat to last year and EPS to be flat to slightly up, reflecting the presence of Asda in our financials for about half the quarter and some tax rate fluctuations. Due to the timing of FY '21 cost and divestitures, Q2 and Q3 operating income and EPS may be down mid to even high single digits, with Q4 operating income and EPS potentially up mid to high single digits.\nAgain, and I probably can't stress this enough, we are in a very unusual time, causing projections even in the short-term to be very challenging and open to significant fluctuation. Many times I get asked by analysts, investors and others, are we missing anything about Walmart. And I've thought a lot about this question lately. And even for someone like me that's been here for over 20 years, I have to step back and see the evolution through a different lens.\nWalmart's different than it was last year, three years ago, and certainly five years ago; its faster, its more creative and its less risk averse. It's actively creating its future by building on a set of unique strengths and capabilities.\nLet me describe the Walmart I want you to see. We have more customer store traffic than anyone in the world. We have one of, if not the largest pickup businesses in the world. And we are scaling delivery. We are one of the largest eCommerce companies in the world, approaching $100 billion in revenue in the next couple of years, and we believe $200 billion a few years after that.\nWe have one of the largest marketplace businesses in the world, and now we are scaling a marketplace fulfillment services business to grow even faster. We are majority owner of one of the most successful retailers in the world, Walmex, with over $50 billion market cap with great growth opportunities.\nIn India, we are majority owner of one of the largest eCommerce and payment businesses in one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the world. We have a $75 billion club business globally, one of the fastest growing segments in the retail industry. And it's a winner in three key markets; in the U.S., Mexico, and China. We have a rapidly growing advertising platform, which should be a multibillion dollar business in the very near future.\nWe are a global leader in supply chain innovation with exciting initiatives on the table. We are a global leader in sustainability with a clear aspirational goal to become regenerative. We have both growth and scale. We reduced our exposures in Brazil, Argentina, the U.K., Japan, and we will still have a top line that's over $0.5 trillion. That's the Walmart I want to make sure you see. This is the time for us to accelerate and we are ready.\nAnd as always, I thank you for your interest in Walmart. And I will turn it over to Doug.\nDoug McMillon\nThank you, Brett. Thank you for your leadership and partnership. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the year. Growth was strong across the company. Innovation and speed picked up. We moved quickly to add new capabilities to protect the health of our associates, serve customers and members safely in our stores and clubs and serve them with more capacity for pickup and delivery.\nWe found ways to support the explosive growth in eCommerce and learned how to hire people in hours rather than days, which enabled hundreds of thousands of people to get work when they really needed it and when we really needed them. We managed our business well in an unpredictable environment, but we certainly didn't get everything right.\nGiven supply constraints, our in-stock suffered significantly during portions of the year. Store standards were impacted. We would reduce store hours and limit customer density all over again, but that did impact our sales. Those realities should provide some upside in 2021 as we lap the extraordinarily strong results of last year.\nI want to thank our associates around the world. They have been courageous. They are adapting to change. They worked really hard to overcome the hurdles presented by one of the most difficult periods in history, and I know they'll continue to do so. The challenges of the past year came in different forms and weren't limited to the health crisis.\nWe are all aware of the difficult social, political and economic realities that we face. These are deep-rooted problems that we all have to tackle. As for Walmart, we will continue to be part of the solutions. As it relates to the health crisis, we helped with PPE for healthcare workers and stood up COVID testing sites. We donated more than 625 million pounds of food and over $55 million in grants for hunger relief in 2020. Now, we are supporting the country in the vaccination effort.\nAs it relates to the financial crisis, we will help with employment and we will help small businesses by buying their goods, building an expanded marketplace for sellers and as Sam's Club serves family-owned restaurants and other small businesses. Small businesses are vital to our economy.\nWhen it comes to the social and political challenges we all face, we will engage in public conversations in ways that are thoughtful, constructive and in line with our values. We are committed to racial equity. We will keep changing inside our company and find ways to leverage our business and influence to shape systems extending beyond our company. This work is important to me and it's important to our associates, including our leadership, and we know it's strategic. Being diverse and inclusive is smart business.\n2020 not only confirmed our strategy, it accelerated it by fast-forwarding many of the customer trends we've been building towards. We feel emboldened and are now moving with even more speed and aggressiveness. We are scaling new capabilities and businesses and designing them to work together in a mutually reinforcing way.\nAs we imagine the future, we believe people, our customers, families will want an even better value for their money; a merchandise assortment that is relevant to their life and seems limitless; services that help them save time, save money and get or stay healthy; an experience that is easy and enjoyable. And the knowledge that the company they do business with can be trusted to treat everyone in their supply chain well and take actions that strengthen our planet.\nIn the future, people will still want to shop in compelling stores, but more and more, there will be occasions where they prefer to pick up an order or have it delivered. Some customers will eventually allow us and pay us to keep them replenished in their homes on the items they routinely purchase.\nFor an increasing number of customers, Walmart will be seen more like a service. Customers will think of us as the merchant that serves their wants and needs, but in ways that take less time and effort. We won't just be utilitarian for them. We will serve up items and ideas that are relevant and exciting. We will reach them directly and through other platforms.\nOur customer relationships will continue to broaden and deepen in health and wellness and financial services. Our customers view these as natural and expected components of their Walmart experience. We will weave all these things together in a seamless way.\nSo we are in an early stage of building a new business model that will enable us to serve people how they want to be served in any particular moment and thrive in the next generation of retail as a business. Over time, we believe the big winners in retail will be those that deliver a unique interrelated ecosystem.\nMany of you will remember the original Walmart productivity loop. We lowered prices, grew sales and leveraged expenses. Some of you will remember the ecosystem chart we shared in 2018. While we continue to learn, our thinking moves on and so we'd like to share today's version as a way to describe our emerging business model. It should help you better understand how we will serve customers and drive sustainable, diversified operating income growth over time.\nAs I describe it, some of my comments are specific to the U.S., but you should think of this as applying in all of our priority markets around the world. Think about it as a flywheel that's spinning, powered by a mutually reinforcing set of assets.\nWe start with the customer in the center. We are designing for them. Our relationship with them is founded on our ability to provide them the lowest prices on the items they buy all the time. They come to our stores and our app to get the things they want or need. Our first priority is to continue to earn their business when it's time to buy the big basket, the stock up trip, to be the best and first place they shop. We do that well with the supercenter format. Having a broad assortment so close to 90% of America is an advantage.\nAs we've added pickup and delivery capabilities, we've experienced a lot of growth, but too often, we aren't able to meet the demand. This is a good problem to have, but we need to solve it quickly, given how trends accelerated as a result of the pandemic. So we are going to invest more aggressively in capacity and automation to position ourselves to earn the primary destination position with customers. We are absolutely playing offense here.\nCustomers can choose to visit a store, pick up their order, have it delivered, have it delivered into a secure box on their front step, into a garage refrigerator, or all the way into their kitchen, even when they're not at home. When you hear us say delivery, define that as the combination of delivery from our stores, clubs and eCommerce fulfillment centers.\nOur customers and members are indifferent as to whether their delivered items come from a store or an FC. So we can optimize for speed and costs behind the scenes as we meet or exceed customer expectations. Over time, more and more of our customers will want Walmart+ because it makes life better. That relationship will drive repeat business and provide data that enables us to serve them even better and be more personalized. It's an important piece of our strategy. For now, we are focused on continuing a high quality experience for Walmart+ members as we add capacity. Over time, we will add more benefits to the membership to broaden its appeal.\nMoving to 3 o'clock on the wheel, the demand we've been experiencing in general merchandise is amazing. Beyond the pandemic, our eCommerce business will continue to grow at a fast pace. We expect our eCommerce sales globally to be over $100 billion in the next couple of years. We continue to add assortment and brands.\nOur emphasis here is on general merchandise. We've got a lot of upside in apparel, home and hardlines. To capture that upside, we're going to pull forward investments in space and automation. As our fulfillment capacity grows, we'll use it to improve the customer experience, expand our first-party assortment, grow our marketplace and build our fulfillment services business, which is scaling nicely.\nBeyond selling merchandise, we can do more to serve the healthcare needs of families. They want and need high quality preventative, accessible and affordable health care. They want and need high-quality, preventative, accessible and affordable health care. As you evaluate our opportunity in health care, consider not only our pharmacy, optical, hearing and OTC businesses, but also consider our position as the country's largest seller of food and how that relates to health.\nOur locations, which enable access; our large stores and large parking lots, which give us room to expand; our experience with the associate benefits, where we cover a lot of lives; and our growing digital capabilities; together they create the opportunity for a differentiated omni-channel health care business that helps a lot of people. We aren't starting from scratch. We are convinced our customers want this and they trust us to provide it.\nFinancial services are also a way we can help make daily life better for customers. Last month, we announced the formation of a new FinTech startup, designed to develop and offer innovative and affordable financial solutions. Our customers have been clear that they want more from us in terms of financial services and this new approach will help us deliver for them in a differentiated way more quickly. For a FinTech startup, customer acquisition costs are high and our platform lowers those costs. We have a head start.\nMoving to 6 o'clock on the wheel, our purpose is to save money and help people live better. So we must operate at a lower cost and do it in a way that's sustainable. As you know, we've had several automation tests going on. I'm very pleased to share a few of the most important forms are now ready to scale. These investments will enable us to improve the customer experience and increase productivity. Our digital transformation continues. Our way of working, our use of data and the modernization of our tech stack continue.\nEarlier I mentioned diversifying our profit base. Scaling new profit pools is a priority. Big marketplace and fulfillment services, advertising, financial services, data monetization and last-mile delivery; these are all early stage businesses that are scaling or are positioned to scale. The resulting more diversified model will allow us to sustainably reinvest back into the customer value proposition and choose how much flows through into profit.\nAs I walked through the flywheel, I mentioned several investments. Based on everything I've learned over the years and the opportunity I see looking ahead, this is the right time to make these investments. The strategy, team and capabilities are in place. We know where the customer's going. We have momentum and our balance sheet is strong. Here's what we see.\nFirst, the combination of stores and eCommerce is a winner. Last year, step changed our eCommerce business and our stores are an asset. We have demand and need more space earlier than we had planned a year ago. Given the delivery is a key driver of Walmart+, we need more capacity to grow Walmart+ with a high Net Promoter Score.\nSecond, our automation plan is now ready to scale. We will be investing in our distribution centers, our eCommerce fulfillment centers and in-market fulfillment centers, which will in many cases be inside of or built beside our stores. John will tell you more about what this means for our U.S business. Those investments will enable productivity improvements for years to come. They have a nice IRR.\nBig picture, think of our U.S supply chain with hundreds of distribution and fulfillment centers, thousands of stores and clubs so close to so many people, functioning in a hybrid fashion, automated where they should be based on volumes and complemented with onsite market fulfillment centers or offsite MFCs where we see incremental demand.\nImportantly, imagine our supply chain is interconnected so the cost to meet or exceed customer expectations is optimized. And imagine our growing network with a next-gen level of automation. I think the next few years will represent more change in our supply chain than even the grocery DC rollout we did to support supercenters. It's really exciting. We will keep investing in store remodels so that our stores are fresh and appealing. We will also continue to invest in our people.\nLast fall, we changed the structure in our U.S stores leaning even more into teams. At that time, we gave a raise to 165,000 people. And now, we will be raising wages for 425,000 more. These are investments in people that are important to our future, because they provide a great pickup, delivery and in-store experience for our customers. These investments are part of a strategy we pursued since I started in this role.\nWe've increased our starting wages by more than 50% since 2015. Once these increases are implemented, approximately half of our U.S hourly associates, about 730,000 people will earn at least $15 an hour. Our average wage in the U.S will be at least $15.25 per hour. Our supply chain associates are already earning $15 or more and we've made additional wage investments in Sam's Club over the last few years.\nImportantly, in addition to hourly wage rates, we will continue investing to provide career opportunities through our internal education programs and access to affordable degrees. Because of technology, the future of work will be different and we want to prepare our associates for that journey. We believe we should do more than provide just an hourly wage.\nBonuses for some roles, our 401(k) match, stock ownership plan, affordable health care and other components are smart investments. We will make these investments in our supply chain and people, while also staying on track to modernize our technology. To pay for all that, we will keep growing sales, expand our general merchandise business and scale mutually reinforcing and profitable businesses.\nThe guidance that Brett provided this morning includes these investments for these areas I've just described. One way to think about us is to recognize our people and physical assets as strategic moats and realize that we're changing how we think and work to build digital products and related businesses that complement those assets and have helpful margins; marketplace, advertising and membership income, for example.\nWe aren't strangers to membership. Sam's Club in the U.S., China and Mexico is performing very well and that performance accelerated during 2020. Sam's is innovating, adding new capabilities and improving our merchandise offer, especially in fresh food and with our Member's Mark private brand. Sam's is a big business for us and it has strong momentum.\nAs I mentioned before, this mutually reinforcing flywheel concept applies in our priority markets outside the U.S. Specific elements of the flywheel, such as pickup and delivery, eCommerce and marketplace, fulfillment services, payment and other financial services and advertising have application in Mexico, Canada, India and China. The same flywheel assets are adapted to be relevant to the specific needs of the customer in each market and to leverage our different operating models.\nLet me focus on Mexico and India for a minute. We see an opportunity to grow eCommerce market share in Mexico. Our stores business is strong and an omni-channel approach will be a winner in this market. Our Walmex team has done a great job of growing eCommerce, including a strong same-day delivery option from stores and clubs.\nThe pandemic had a similar impact to customer trends in Mexico as it did in the U.S. So, now the next step for us is to leverage the momentum we have to grow 1P and 3P eCommerce through investments and technology, supply chain and customer acquisition. The team is building alternative income streams to complement our traditional retail business, including advertising.\nIn India, our momentum and potential for growth make this a unique opportunity; eCommerce penetration still low, but growing rapidly. We are well-positioned to grow as an emerging middle-class spends more money through their mobile phones. Like the U.S and Mexico, this is a market where we will step on the gas to ensure we have the appropriate level of investment in areas like supply chain.\nThe PhonePe business continues to grow and perform very well. These are homegrown businesses with innovation and problem solving for the Indian customer at their core. We continue to be impressed with Flipkart and PhonePe talent led by Kalyan and Sameer. You will hear from them along with Judith in a little while.\nI've talked a lot about investing for growth and I also think it's important for us to call out the areas where we are narrowing our focus and making choices. We are deploying capital to areas where we see the best opportunity for growth while pulling back in other areas.\nOver the last few years, you've seen us divest restaurants and apparel specialty chain, banks, Vudu and eCommerce businesses and brands along with markets like Brazil and Argentina. We\u2019ve announced new ownership structures in the U.K and Japan moving us to a minority position.\nWe\u2019ve executed these decisions to narrow our focus while also developing important partnerships to drive growth like those with JD.com, Tata, Aditya Birla Fashion Retailer and Ninjacart. We are being deliberate about where we invest, where we divest and where we partner. We are a good partner and we are flexible.\nIn order for us to pull all of these work streams together into a cohesive, well-executed strategy, the organization has to think and work in new ways. Think about it as an enabler of our strategy, whether it's moving to an agile way of working, prioritizing digital acumen and diversity in our talent base, or developing new ownership structures around the world, we will function in a way that supports innovation, speed and productivity.\nOur product teams and technologists are working hand-in-hand with business leaders every day to develop and deploy the right products at the right time for our customers and associates. The tech team we've assembled is working to take our technology to the next level.\nWe will do the things I've described while staying true to our purpose and our core values and while taking a shared value approach. The best way to create a valuable company is to build for the long-term, manage the short-term and serve all the relevant stakeholders. So we are systems thinkers. We connect dots. We design sustainability into our holistic supply chain and save money doing it by eliminating waste.\nEnvironmental, social and governance issues aren't side projects. They are strategic, core and part of our culture as aspirations push us beyond sustainability. This is a holistic approach that supports and replenishes humanity and nature. Regeneration means renewing and replenishing in addition to preserving and doing less harm.\nOur target of zero emissions by 2040 with no offsets is an ambitious and motivating challenge. We believe it's important to push toward zero in our own operations, even where it's difficult and may not be feasible with current technology. Our push will help drive necessary innovation. We will lead where we can and help make possible what's not currently possible.\nClimate change remains at the forefront of our ambitions on regeneration, and you've heard us talk many times about Project Gigaton and our efforts to reduce emissions in the supply chain of our business and those of our suppliers. To date, suppliers have reported a cumulative 375 million metric tons of avoided emissions. We are well on our way to our goal of avoiding 1 billion metric tons of emissions.\nIn summary, we are confident in our strategy. Now is the time for us to be aggressive. Speed matters. We are going to keep the customer in the center and design for them. The new business model we are building will allow us to thrive to reinvent. There is so much opportunity in front of us. Our associates, including our leadership, are the reason we have so much confidence. Sam Walton was described as a merchant with a servant's heart. Our associates are continuing that legacy. Thank you for your attention.\nIn a moment, we will begin the first of two Q&A sessions. Brett and I will take your questions about what we've shared so far and then you will hear more from the team.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nDan Binder\nThank you for joining our Q&A session this morning. As a reminder, if you have a question, please click Raise Hand. You can find this under the Reactions or Participants button. When the host calls upon you, click the Unmute button that will appear on your screen and then you may ask your question. We will take a moment.\nOur first question will come from Peter Benedict at R.W. Baird. And after that, we will go to Paul Trussell. Peter?\nPeter Benedict\nOkay. Dan, thanks. Can you hear me?\nDoug McMillon\nYes, we got you.\nDan Binder\nYes.\nPeter Benedict\nOkay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks. So, I guess two-part question here. First, just on the higher capital spend, maybe can you tease that out a little bit more, Brett, maybe some of the components there, what areas of the business are getting how much? And then, as you think beyond this year, you talked about the 2.5% to 3% of sales. Are there certain areas that will get more of that versus less, kind of what's the -- what continues beyond this year? And I guess, related to that, on the U.S wage investment, where do you think your U.S associate base should all be making at least $15 an hour, is there a timeframe we should be thinking about for that? Thank you.\nBrett Biggs\nYes. Peter, thanks. I will kick off. So on capital, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, we're going to lean into the places that we're going -- that we've talked about from a strategic standpoint really for several years, but definitely this morning. So we are leaning more particularly on supply chain and eCommerce. Peter, you've been following the company for a long time, if you go back several years, we were spending 50%, 60% or more of capital on new stores. Now that's turning toward ensuring we have the right amount of capacity we need to fulfill the customers' desires as much as the way that they want to be fulfilled, but then also getting it to customers more quickly. Those are the kind of things that we're going to be focused on.\nAnd innovation, there're so many things that are going on from innovation standpoint in supply chain, and we've been on the front edge of that, Doug, and thinking about how we get pallets to the stores and how we make it easier to pick in the backrooms. And those are the kind of things over the next few years where you're going to continue to see us lean in, and globally, not just in the U.S.\nDoug McMillon\nYes. Good morning, Peter. I will just add that I'm really excited that we're now to the point where we can invest in some of this automation. I know you've been following us closely. We've been working on this for a while. And now we've got these various forms, distribution center technology, fulfillment center technology, store level market fulfillment center technology that we can start to really scale. And that will take a few years to roll that out, but we like the customer experience benefits, we like the productivity improvements that we're going to see.\nAnd this year just really fast-forwarded things in terms of customer behavior. We think the vast majority of that behavior is going to last. And it's terrific that the automation we've been working on is now ready. Maybe if anything I wish it'd been ready a year ago, but at least we're there now and we can get going on it. So, I'm really excited about that.\nAs it relates to associate wages, the approach that we have been trying to take for years now is to make sure that we are creating this ladder of opportunity, providing an opportunity for people when they start with the company to build a career, like so many of us have. And so, the investments that we're making right now are aimed at this new structure that we put in place. It's even more of a team approach to getting the work done across the store that needs to get done.\nObviously, picking in the store has become really important. Managing inventory is obviously really important. And this new structure is going to help us do those things more effectively. And those people that we are raising wages for tend to have been with us for a longer period of time than someone that might be earning the entry wage. And so, we're trying to move that average up, create that ladder, and continue to have associates that come through our system and become store managers. We've got about 75% of our store management that starts as hourlies.\nThe alternative would be to invest all of that to try and get to $15 faster, but if we do that, then we wouldn't be able to create this succession that we're committed to creating. We will raise our starting wage rate over time, and I think our history proves that. I mean, we've gone since 2015 from $9 to $10 to $11, we are up over 50% in our starting wage rate. And we will be sensitive to geographies, on their parts of the country where the starting wage should be lower than others and we're obviously really well aware of what's happening nationally with this discussion around $15. And I think that that\u2019s an important target, but I also think that that should be paced in a way that's good for the U.S economy. And you can kind of see us as a model working through how that works. But, I'm really excited to raise the wages today for so many people.\nDan Binder\nGreat. Thank you, Peter. We will go to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank next, and then Karen Short after that.\nPaul Trussell\nGood morning. Thank you for the color and especially for the willingness to provide guidance in a volatile and dynamic backdrop, and guidance is really where my questions lie. Brett, to the extent you can dig deeper, can you just help us a little bit more on some of the many moving parts in looking at your fiscal '22, just how best we should think about the impact of the U.K., Argentina, Japan, wage investment, COVID costs, just as best as you know today? And then, Doug, as you kind of still expect the top line in the U.S to remain positive despite the tough compares, just discuss what\u2019s driving that confidence and what the digital contribution to that growth looks like?\nBrett Biggs\nYes. Paul, it's good to see you. You almost answered your question as that's how you're asking the question. As we were talking through, as you can imagine, we're talking through wanting to give guidance this year because it's -- we want to give you the best view that we have right now, knowing everything that we know. But we know less than we typically do in a normal year about what's going to happen with the vaccine, what's going to happen with economies, what's going to happen in other parts of what's going on.\nSo, we've tried to raise up the guidance a little bit and to be fair to give you just a -- give you a little more high level guidance than we have, and so, getting to the individual pieces and talking about any of those specifics would be pretty challenging. But if you look at even the top line guidance, we've given you as close as we can without divestitures or excluding divestitures, so we're trying to give you apples-to-apples. And so, with that, we think low single-digit growth for the company and Walmart U.S. is possible. You got stimulus plans and other things that are sitting out there. But even with that, Walmart U.S. would have a 10% to your stack. So, it would be very, very healthy growth.\nSame thing on the EPS and operating income. We're trying to give you apples-to-apples as if Asda in Japan and all that are still in the business, obviously there's not, and there will be an impact top line and bottom line from that. I know you appreciate the situation that all of us are in with COVID and we wanted to give you as good as guidance as we could right now.\nDoug McMillon\nAs it relates to U.S growth, Paul, obviously there's a lot of variance week-to-week, month-to-month, quarter-to- quarter, and I'm sure every retailer, and we certainly did, kept a really good diary about what was happening every day as we went through that year. And just looking back on all the things that happened even in February and March a year ago is a long list of activities, things that occurred in the environment and decisions that we made. Many of those decisions restricted sales in our stores. We changed hours. We metered how many people could be in the store. And obviously, we were hit hard from an in-stock point of view.\nNormally, it's a great thing to have inventory turns and we were managing our supply chain well, but we didn't have these huge stockpiles sitting to the side for the surges that we saw on things like consumables. So, I would never seen anything like what happened in our stores as we went through the year. And it was a real challenge for our associates, our store managers, our assistant managers, our associates deserve so much credit for being able to adapt. Some of them were on leave.\nWe had people join the company. We hired over 0.5 million people during the course of last year to help fill in for those on leave and to react to the additional demand that we had for pick and delivery. So, imagine being a store manager dealing with a lot of associates without much experience. So, we've got all these things underneath the surface; in-stock, store hours, associates that were less experienced. All of those factors cause us to think.\nIf things continue to improve, the vaccine roll-out continues, people start to come back out, people will come back to Walmart that may have been shopping locally because they were trying to manage the COVID situation carefully. We've talked about our market shares as we've gone through the year. We think we've got an opportunity in food and consumables to grow market share this next year. So, those are the kinds of things that cause us to feel like it's appropriate to forecast that increase in sales and then go earn it. There will be a lot of volatility quarter-by-quarter and we will just do the best job we can, Paul, of explaining what we're seeing as we go through it.\nDan Binder\nThank you, Paul. Next, we will go to Karen Short with Barclays, and then to Simeon Gutman after that.\nKaren Short\nHi. Thanks. Can you hear me?\nDoug McMillon\nHi, Karen.\nKaren Short\nHey, there. Yes. Thanks so much for all the color. Really helpful. I wanted to just -- one clarification, just on the EPS. So we used $5.28 as the base, correct, in terms of flat to slightly up. But then, the bigger question I had it was just on the U.S operating profit in general. So, when I kind of do back of the envelope math on the employees getting the wage increase, I get kind of close to 14% impact to operating profit in the U.S. And you've obviously guided to slightly up operating profit in the U.S. So, maybe can you parse that out a little bit more, because that seems -- and I know you've guided to up sales, so -- or up comps in the U.S., so that's a component of it. But maybe a little color on that, because that 14% hit, it seems like a fairly large lump to overcome to still have the U.S be up?\nBrett Biggs\nSure. I will walk you through that. So, on the EPS, you're correct, the $0.20 that we talked about is related to Asda. There will still be a little bit of impact from Japan because that is accretive as well, assuming we get that transaction closed in the next few weeks. But the way you did your math would be accurate. On the U.S., there's a lot changing in the P&L and one of the things over the last several years is we've had gross margin that has decreased fairly significantly as we've invested in price and done other things.\nNow, as we have price gaps in a pretty good position certainly versus where they were years ago; the way that we're able to move product, we're getting efficiencies there, the new income streams that you see us having; the general merchandise business, which is improved, that's helps mix; eCommerce contribution margin, that continues to prove, all of that helps gross margin. So in the past where you're starting with gross margin going down fairly significantly at times, that's really not the case probably as we look forward.\nSo on the expense side, do you have increased wages, but you also had significant COVID costs this year and other things that hit the expense line. But when you balance all of that out and again, Karen, we are giving you the best view that we can, we do think that Walmart U.S. can continue to grow operating income, but there's just a lot of things inside of that.\nDoug McMillon\nIt's helpful to have the eCommerce improvements that we saw. Brett mentioned the contribution profit improvement. That's driven through apparel and home mix and other things, including the fact that we finally put our merchant teams together. And John and Marc worked really well with the merchants, Scott McCall and others, to help people come on board and take on that additional responsibility in a way that's been helpful. And then, the volume growth leverages fixed costs in a different way. So as you've heard over and over again, a lot of things just got fast-forwarded and changed and changed the shape of what we're looking at.\nBrett Biggs\nAnd the additional revenue streams that we've been talking about, we will talk about even more this morning, advertising, financial services, marketplace, those things that really weren't large businesses at all, they're growing and they're scaling and they're becoming a bigger part of the Walmart U.S. P&L. So that's a positive. Thank you.\nDan Binder\nThank you, Karen. Next, we will go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley and then we will go to Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.\nDoug McMillon\nHey, Simeon.\nSimeon Gutman\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'll first have may be a two parter for Doug and then a one part for you, Brett. Doug, you mentioned balancing and managing all the interests of stakeholders and you guys have done a good job of that over the last few years. So this is the, why not invest more upfront in this year, how much of a debate is that? And then, can you tell us how much of this investment plan is new or is it pulling forward what would have been a 5 or 10-year plan?\nAnd then, to you, Brett, thinking about fiscal '23 and beyond, I realize you gave a construct, is the leverage point of the business or again, of the retail business increasing such that you can't get higher incremental margins over time? And for some of those things you just mentioned, plus advertising, it seems like the incremental margins should get better, especially as you invest in supply chain and get more efficient. But you said, roughly, in line EBIT growth to sales, I'm sure it's far out and so you're being careful, but why shouldn't we expect higher incrementals over time?\nBrett Biggs\nYou may start. Do you want to \u2026?\nDoug McMillon\nI will go first.\nBrett Biggs\nOkay.\nDoug McMillon\nWhen you think about why not more, the two pieces that go through my mind are the automation investments and then the wage investment. On the automation side, I think we're going as quickly and as aggressively as we can and should go. These things will take some time. If we find that it's working really well and we can go faster, I'm going to be in the camp of wanting to go faster, because this looks like it's going be really great for our supply chain, great for customers, great for the company from a financial point of view.\nOn the wage side, we've been on a path, we've got a strategy, we've got a plan, and we are executing that plan. And you'll just see us continue to make investments at the right time we think in the right levels while also investing in automation to help with productivity. We are trying to play a harmony here and balance these things together. And one things I'm excited about, by the way, is that as we've been changing, we've been able to add a lot of jobs, which I think is great. It's great for the economy. It's great for people to have employment. And automation historically tends to change work and create new opportunities. And I think that's what we're seeing.\nI mean, a number of people that we've hired to pick orders in stores and a number of people that we will need to run the automation investments that we are making, there's going to be opportunity for folks. And we are trying to craft this whole approach with not only hourly wages, but what we do with benefits and incentives, what we do with health care, what we do with 401(k) match and all of those things to retain people in a way that you get the highest level of productivity, because people are brought in on what the company is doing. So we think we are doing this strategically at the right pace, as it relates to the wage investments. So I think the one place where we could go faster if it all works is automation, and it is a pull forward. We were planning on doing these things. I think two things happened. One is the pandemic changed behavior faster than we would have had in our model. And then, secondly, it just so happens that two or three of these kind of came together in a way that they're ready to be scaled at the same time, and that's great.\nBrett Biggs\nYes, Simeon, the way you think about the profit algorithm is right. And I said in my comments that this company looks pretty different than 5 years ago and 5 years from now it's going to look different again. And the comment I made in the remarks was that I do think operating income should grow faster than sales. And as an executive team, as we talk through these investments, when making these investments that's what we think we should do. And when you look at the -- our ability to generate revenue and profit in different ways, if you look at general merchandise business that's growing and changes the mix, as you look at contribution margins in eCommerce changing, all of that lead you to believe that operating income can grow faster than sales in the mid to long-term, and that's what we expect to do as a company.\nDoug McMillon\nAbsolutely. We want that to happen. We think that will happen. We've got a path to make that happen. And it's cool that it's happening in a different way that's sustainable and more digital in nature. I mean, we've become more of a digital company, and that's important in the way that customers live and work and behave these days and the way you can stitch things together. I remember growing up watching other retailers, Sears comes to mind, that diversified, and learning in business school, that there were mistakes made.\nAnd looking at what's happening today and what we are trying to do, the thing that's different is technology, the internet is different, digital is different, the way you can stitch these things together is different. And when I look at the flywheel that we showed you a few minutes ago, I get really excited about the arrows that connect the dots. If we can design these things in a way that we become more of a default for certain aspects of their life because of the way we've intuitively designed things, that\u2019s where the magic can really happen. And that is possible today because of digital and technology when it wasn't years ago.\nDoug McMillon\nCFOs don't get excited very often, but as I see this business model shaping up, it is really exciting. It's a really different look to the company, that\u2019s great.\nDoug McMillon\nIt doesn't feel like we're getting too far away from core.\nBrett Biggs\nYes, still within the core.\nDoug McMillon\nI'm not worried -- yes.\nBrett Biggs\nYes, that's what's so exciting about it.\nDoug McMillon\nAnd we've got a team today that thinks that way.\nBrett Biggs\nYes.\nDoug McMillon\nSome of the talent that's been with us for a long time as well as some new folks.\nDan Binder\nThanks, Simeon. Next, we will go to Bob Drbul with Guggenheim, and then to Steph Wissink with Jefferies following that.\nRobert Drbul\nGood morning, guys. I just had a couple of questions. I think the first one, on the flywheel, Doug, you talked about the flywheel a little bit, can you just talk about how you think it will evolve with the new businesses that you're adding beyond what you showed today? Can we start with that one?\nDoug McMillon\nWell, Bob, if we were ready to talk about that, we would have gone ahead and told you that that's what we were planning. But it's obvious that is as you put the customer in the middle, you put families in the middle, and you think about the opportunity you have, if you're the one selling them the items they buy all the time and serving up the items that they might love to discover, it just creates all kinds of opportunity. I think financial services as a suite is one example.\nHealth care leads you in a lot of different places. The idea that we could help people with health care in a way that makes health care in the country more preventative, certainly high quality, affordable, accessible is something that I think not only opens us up to all of the industries that make up health care, but also helps with the overall relationship in the way that people think about Walmart, and that could lead us into a lot of different directions.\nThe other one that comes to mind that was on our list but we didn't talk a lot about it is data monetization. Data is obviously really valuable and we've got a history of giving our data away to suppliers and doing that so that we could get in-stock and that's obviously really important and some portions of our data will continue to be free because we need their help serving our mutual customers. But there are other aspects of our data that are really valuable and can be put to work in ways that we haven't before.\nAnd the concept of building products, digital products that we can use internally and also monetize outside is a really exciting prospect. And some of those things will be purely digital, some will be a combination of people plus digital. Think of last mile, for example, this advantage that we have with supercenters so close to people can be monetized in ways that we haven't before, because the speed it provides and the relationship that it provides. So, I think in future years just as we did today, we will show you this evolving business model and show you new things. And in some cases we may tell you, this one didn't work, we are taking it off, we're adding this one on, and I think that's how it should be frankly. Go ahead Bob, we still see you.\nRobert Drbul\nYes, sorry. Yes, just were in the mute. Two questions for Brett, really. I think the first one is, can you talk about your price investment flexibility? There's been a lot of discussion from the CPG companies about taking price and their ability to take price. So how do you guys fit into that and how are you thinking about it? The second question I think also for Brett. With the cost of debt being where it is, can you talk a little bit about your willingness to perhaps maybe take on some debt for additional share buyback, or any thoughts around that would be helpful? Thanks. That will be it.\nBrett Biggs\nYes, on price I said our price gap's early as good as they've been, in some cases higher than they've been. We are going to continue to be the price leader in markets; it's really important to what we do. It's important to our customers and it's part of who we are as a company. But we're going to be thoughtful about it. We're going to be strategic about it. We want you to come in, and as a customer, as you get a basket from Walmart we want that to be the best deal you can get as a customer. That's who we are in EDLP.\nDoug McMillon\nYes, I will just add that John and Scott and the team are thinking about rollbacks. I mean, there are going to be times this year that it would be difficult for families and we've got this history of creating rollbacks and lowering prices, and some of those plans are in place with the guidance that we gave you earlier today.\nBrett Biggs\nYes, and your question on capital obviously is a good one. We just announced the $20 billion share buyback today that we think we will execute over the next three years or so. We are in an enviable cash position because of the cash we generated because of the execution now of the Asda transaction and cash coming in. It's okay to think to hold a little more cash right now. We are -- we always look at share buyback. The first thing we want to do, Bob, and you've seen this more is we want to invest in the business. That's the first thing we always want to do and I think we're doing that to the extent that we feel like we need to, to execute our strategy. Our dividend, we just increased it 48 years in a row. And then you get down kind of to share buyback, I feel good about our company. I feel great about the valuation of the company. And so you will continue to see us, as you can tell by what I said this morning, pretty aggressive from a share buyback standpoint.\nDan Binder\nThanks, Bob. Next we will go to Steph Wissink at Jefferies and then Michael Lasser after that.\nStephanie Wissink\nGood morning everyone. We also have two questions if we could. Doug, the first is for you. I was really struck by the language you were using around shifting from an option for your consumers to being their preferred choice, or their preferred destination, primary destination. So can you talk a little bit more about how you energize your teams to really think about Walmart as the primary destination, and maybe give us a little hint on Walmart+, where you are in some of the learnings around that?\nAnd then, Brett, a question for you, and maybe this goes back to an earlier question on the incremental margins. But if I'm hearing you correctly, your past fiscal '22 expanding margin leverage from an expense perspective, expanding margins on the gross side from a mix and some of the alternative streams of value perspective, how should we translate that into the flow through to operating margin? Something better than that 30 basis points, 40 basis points a year? Thank you.\nDoug McMillon\nYes. I will go first on primary destination. The Supercenter does a great job of doing that. And I always think of what it was like when I was a teenager and my mom was headed out the door and she would say, I'm going to Walmart, what do you need? I didn't really think about it then, but looking back on it now, the fact that she didn't say I'm going shopping, or I'm going to a grocery store what you need, she said I'm going to Walmart. And she bought everything that we could possibly buy at Walmart, and so many Americans and people around the world do that today and that's obviously really important. But we didn't get that done in eCommerce in early stages.\nWe weren't the first place you go when it's time to buy products online. We are trying to change that obviously. You've got to earn that; you've got to have the assortment, you got to have the price, you got to provide service, you got to deliver when you're supposed to deliver. All of those things have to be done. And it takes some time to build those kinds of capabilities. But as we are building that, the opportunity we have is in the way that we put them together. And if the combination of the Supercenter stores, neighborhood markets, in some cases Sam's Club and the Internet can cause Walmart in the omni-channel future to continue to be a primary destination, that's obviously the number one thing that we want to get done and that's a priority for us.\nOnce you have that, and that doesn't mean it's just food and consumables, people are buying a lot of hard lines or buying general merchandise. Our general merchandise share went up this past year, driven largely by what was happening in stores. eCommerce obviously grew at a higher rate, but the store volume was amazing. If we can get that done, it opens up all these other opportunities with the flywheel as we were discussing earlier.\nWalmart+ is a component of that plan. But the number one aspect of the three dimensions we've got today for Walmart+ is the delivery of items from our supercenters. eCommerce deliveries are important, but the supercenter perishable assortment is obviously really important. And we've got a limit on how much we can pick and deliver from stores. The automation that we're investing in will help change that. And the other capacity choices that we're making will help unlock that, which will enable Walmart+ to grow more.\nWe don't want to get ahead of ourselves and go sell too many Walmart+ memberships and have a customer experience that is less than our expectation, or their expectation. So Net Promoter Score is a key metric for example that we keep our eye on. So Walmart+ will grow, and there may be some things that we add to it over time that are more digital in nature that enable even more membership growth. But when I think about Walmart+, the thing that I'm focused on most is the Net Promoter Score of a Walmart+ member, not the number of memberships that we're selling.\nThe number of memberships will work out, but let's focus on quality as we start to scale it. Walmart+ then unlocks data that we can use to serve up items for customers more effectively, which helps us with margin mix. So, that's important and something that over time will matter to the company. We are not great at that today. It's a skill we are learning. I mean, I think in the future it will be even more important to the company.\nBrett Biggs\nYes, the construct of the P&L, as you can imagine is pretty near and dear to my heart and it's been fun to go through the last several months with the executive team. And again, I said in my comments, even so it's been as long as I have, you have to step back and realize how many levers we have to pull as a company. And now, we're in higher growth markets in International and we're investing in eCommerce and exciting things in International. We're growing Sam's. There's all these levers that we can pull.\nAnd the good thing about that is that there may be a year we pull this lever, or maybe a year we pull a different lever or maybe a quarter we pull a lever, a quarter we pull another lever, but it all works. When you look longer term, where we are really trying to control our own destiny is really important as we've been focused on operating discipline on the expense side and we've made progress in that regard and I still think that's going to happen longer term; I feel very confident about that.\nThese new revenue streams are growing revenue streams, and profit streams are a big part as well of giving us a different way to make money that just frees up even more levers and gives the company more optionality, which is so important. We talked about sales growth of being over 4% into the future. That helps a lot with every data point when you get sales growing like that, because even at the same operating -- operating margin percentage, you can just grow dollars and that's really what the productivity loop is all about.\nDoug McMillon\nYes, there was a time when I think a lot of people thought, given our scale that we could only grow 1% or 2%. And even before the pandemic, we had proven that was not the case. I mean if you do what customers want you to do, you can grow the top-line and then you can manage the bottom line. So we think what we've put in place the last few years, I'm really confident will help us for a generation. And that's what we are out to do. We are out to position the company for the next generation of retail. And we think because of omni-channel and because of our culture and because of our progress in technology and mindset shift that we've got the opportunity to do that. And we will manage the short-term, but we are building for the long-term.\nBrett Biggs\nBut that -- if these things come together, the way that we believe they will and way we've planned them, it does give opportunity for that operating margin to grow over time.\nDoug McMillon\nAnd some of those things are scaling now. So as we talk about fulfillment services and advertising and some of these other things, 2 years ago we were just getting started, or 18 months ago. I think PhonePe is only 4 or 5 years old. I mean, some of the numbers Judith was covering is like, really, it reached that scale in like 4 years? Four years ago, we weren't even talking that much about a pickup business, which is huge today, right. So when I look at our situation, our flywheel, I don't feel like there is anything speculative in it. We've got traction on these things. It's just that they're smaller, but the ability to grow them seems apparent that we just execute and we can execute. Thanks, Steph.\nDan Binder\nThanks, Steph. Let's go to Michael Lasser with UBS next and then Robbie Ohmes after that. You have to unmute, Michael.\nDoug McMillon\nMichael, we can see you, but we can't hear you. The most uttered phrase these days, you're on mute.\nMichael Lasser\nSorry. Thank you. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Can you more deeply connect the investments that you're making this year and how they're going to allow Walmart to generate that 4% top line growth that you're expecting, especially because one could argue that these investments are necessary just to keep up with the changing environment? For instance, does this mean you expect to be able to maintain 20% to 30% eCommerce growth in U.S. business even as you generate stable to improving sales in the U.S., and why? And as part of this, do you expect that the wage investments to yield as much of a return this time around as they might have last time around, whereas last time you were a bit more proactive, and this time the environment is a little different. Then I have a follow-up on the guidance for this year.\nDoug McMillon\nYes. I think the wage investment will pay off and if you're one of those 400,000 people that we are talking about today, your attitude about Walmart the way you're feeling today is different, and we're asking them to do work in a different way. We are asking our associates to adapt, and I think the investments we are making in them correspond to that. So I do expect a nice return from those investments. It will help with retention. It will help with them able to do their jobs at a really high level of productivity. I am a little distracted by Michael's lack of inability to shave and I'm worried about our razor sales. I'm sorry, I could not get that thought out of the mind.\nMichael Lasser\nTimes are tough. Times are tough.\nDoug McMillon\nWe sell a lot of razors on the app, Michael. Like, you can get some.\nMichael Lasser\nI will be there.\nDoug McMillon\nI know there's a lot of \u2026\nBrett Biggs\nWe haven't seen some of you in a while.\nMichael Lasser\nYes, that\u2019s -- I look forward to when we are together in person.\nDoug McMillon\nIt's a challenge to do all this virtually. As it relates to the 4% growth, we just have a lot of opportunity with eCommerce. We are not good at it yet. I mean, we are adding assortment, we are adding brands. Things are scaling, the marketplace is scaling nicely. We need more investment and capacity to have the fulfillment service achieve its potential and serve customers as well, as ultimately we must. So, yes, I think the investments that we are making are going to create upside, which should translate into not just keeping up with market growth, but exceeding market growth, building on the other relationships we have with customers including the one that's most important right now, which is the one in our stores.\nBrett Biggs\nAnd one thing too, Michael, if you think about now the International markets that we are in, they are for the most part higher growth markets than the total that we've had over the last several years. So that that helps as well.\nMichael Lasser\nMy follow-up question is, as you pointed out at the outset, there is a lot of uncertainty with trying to project sales this year. And this is happening at the same time that you are making these sizable investments. So, if your top line result is a little bit lower than you expect, do you see outsized deleverage in your P&L, or is there room to preserve your profitability such that we should think about while there's uncertainty with the top line, there is less uncertainty with the bottom line for this year?\nDoug McMillon\nYes, there's some room, and we will manage the year as we can go through it as best we can. We've got -- as Brett and I talk about all these levers all the time, and gross margin is one of them. But I wouldn't want to do anything, Michael that harms the business or slows down the strategy beyond this coming year. I think we are going to be fine this coming year and we\u2019ve done the best job we can of describing to you what we see. But we are -- the decisions we are talking about mostly today are not aimed at the next 12 months; they're aimed at the next few years. And we won't lose sight of that. We will stay on track as it relates to those kinds of things.\nDan Binder\nThank you, Michael.\nDoug McMillon\nThanks, Michael.\nDan Binder\nWe will go to Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America next and then Seth Sigman.\nRobert Ohmes\nSorry, guys. Can you hear me?\nDoug McMillon\nHey, Robbie, we are good.\nRobert Ohmes\nGreat. Great to see you. A couple of questions I guess for you, Doug. I was hoping the multibillion dollar ad business in the near future, I was hoping you could maybe talk about it a little more maybe than I was expecting. What -- where does the confidence come from? And I don't know if you can weave into it the TikTok situation. Is there anything you guys learned from that situation about where Walmart fits in within this social media platform world that you can share with us? And then my separate -- well, I will go -- I will ask my separate question for Brett after you answer that question.\nDoug McMillon\nYes. I think as it relates to advertising, Robbie, we've got a unique opportunity because of our stores. We've got all of the things available to us related to eCommerce growth and digital growth. And the reporting we provide for the investors in our advertising program is there. And we can show you that down the road if a customer decides to come into a physical store, our store and buy it, we can connect those dots for you. That's the unique proposition of our advertising program. And we just haven't been that aggressive with our site and app.\nWe want to preserve the customer experience when they're looking for an item and not have ads clutter that up in a way that is going to detract from the experience. So, we are going to manage that as we drive the growth up. But as I mentioned before, there's just a ton of traction there. What\u2019s happening with social commerce is exciting. It's been nice to have assets around the world including in China to learn from how people are behaving as it relates to social commerce. And we think we've got an opportunity to partner in different ways with different people to connect the dots on commerce, because sometimes a marketplace approach to a front-end that's driven by advertising doesn't result in the best customer experience because of lack of fulfillment or other components that make up a great, seamless, fast, simple experience.\nThe TikTok live stream that we tried I think attracted 700,000 people and that happened kind of quick, and I think we can do an even better job of bringing attention to events like that when we want to. And so the team is learning and it will -- I think in 6 months, 12 months, we will look back on social commerce and we will see more traction and we will see Walmart playing a role in that. In some cases that will be just a simple partnership and we will work out the terms of that partnership and that\u2019s what I think you can expect from us as it relates to that. There is a connection back to advertising, where I think our mindset needs to be, we are retailer first, commerce first, serve the customer first and all these other things that flow from that, including the monetization of data and advertising will be secondary and tertiary to the number one thing.\nRobert Ohmes\nYes. That's helpful. Thanks. And then Brett, I was hoping you could -- if you take the US eCommerce business and take away alternative profit streams and then just look at the profitability per transaction across the U.S eCommerce business, did that -- how did that look this last fiscal year versus previous years? And then maybe automation and a lot of these investments you're making, do they improve the profitability of the transactions or is that more about driving revenue growth in digital?\nBrett Biggs\nYes, it's -- Robbie, we've talked about several things over the past few years, several things we look at when we look at that eCommerce P&L, which is a very integrated part of the U.S P&L. When we look at contribution margin, and that's improved this year, it's improved the years before that and so that's a big reason of why we've seen losses reduced in the U.S eCommerce business. But also on the logistics side, the cost to ship, the variable cost to ship has continued to improve. And these investments are there -- I would answer yes to all of what you just asked, as they are there to drive revenue, they're there to drive efficiencies, they're there to drive better customer service or customer experience. It's all of that, and that's what's great about these investments is they're just -- there's all of the pieces that we need from the eCommerce business that fulfills that.\nDoug McMillon\nThe growth in marketplace was a big deal too.\nBrett Biggs\nYes.\nDoug McMillon\nI mean, the first party contribution profit got better and then marketplace scaled, which helps blend the whole thing together. And Robbie, it's kind of reminiscent of how we\u2019ve managed mix back when I learned merchandising to begin with, we had items that we made higher margins on and items we made lower margins on. Today, we are just doing the same thing. It's mix management, but we not only manage category mix, but we manage channel mix with one 1P, 3P all the components that we are talking about which I think is helpful as it relates to our structure now. The omni-channel approach gives people an opportunity to manage things across, and that's how they should be managed.\nBrett Biggs\nThanks, Robbie.\nDan Binder\nThanks Robbie. We've got time for just one more question. We will go to Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.\nDoug McMillon\nHi, Kelly.\nKelly Bania\nHi. Thanks. Can you hear me, okay?\nDoug McMillon\nWe can.\nKelly Bania\nPerfect. Just wanted to ask another question on U.S eCommerce maybe following a little bit from Robbie's question. When we look at U.S EBIT dollar growth, it was about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion this year. Can you just help us understand a little bit the magnitude that eCommerce, the improvement in eCommerce losses contributed to that? Could it be a third, or more? And then I guess, Brett, you talked about reaching maybe $100 billion globally, I think that was in eCommerce over the next few years, so it sounds like maybe 15% to 25% growth. But can you talk a little bit longer-term about what mature margins could be there? And as you think about advertising, financial services marketplace, what is part of that as you think about U.S eCommerce margins, or maybe those are separate?\nBrett Biggs\nYes, there's a lot in that in those questions, Kelly. We -- as you look at the profitability increase in Walmart U.S., particularly this last year there was so many pieces of that. There is improvement, obviously, 8.6% comp sales helped a lot all the way down the P&L. Gross margin rates with improvement in mix, as Doug was talking about, general merchandise with a lot of increased costs, over $4 billion in costs globally as a company related to COVID. So it's a little tough to parse out all of that. And the eCommerce business is becoming even a more integrated part of what we are doing in the stores. But eCommerce losses did improve significantly during the year.\nAs we think about going forward, what I had said in my remarks is that we expected $100 billion in global eCommerce over the next couple years and could see $200 billion a few years after that. All of these -- I mean, going to go back to the comment I made about levers, and we certainly think about and we know the pieces of the business and what the profitability of is each one, and that's important. But we are looking at that total and how do we grow the total.\nHence, we wouldn't be going into these businesses, any of these businesses if we didn't think they were going to be profitable long-term. But each business serves a purpose and it serves potentially a different purpose at a different time. So all of this goes into how we think about our financial algorithm. But having that 4% top line growth, having operating income grow faster than sales, that's the algorithm. How we get there it can change over time, and I think that's great that it can change over time, that we have that flexibility to do that.\nDan Binder\nThanks, Kelly. So that wraps up our first Q&A session. We are going to take a brief 10 minute break and then we will resume our program. Thank you.\nJohn Furner\nGood morning. I've never been more proud to talk about what's happening in the U.S. And let me start by thanking the team, our store associates, our people in fulfillment and distribution centers, our drivers, our technologists and corporate associates. Our people stepped up these past months like never before and they helped their fellow Americans get food, medicine, essential supplies, gifts for holidays and birthdays and even items to start new hobbies, and now they've distributed COVID tests and they're doing vaccines.\nI was in stores throughout the year and it was just incredible to see how our people worked so hard through so many obstacles. The pandemic, civil unrest, natural disasters, accelerated customer volume, constant changes to laws and regulations, and staffing disruptions due to leave that were understandable, but it did affect operations. Yet amid all of these challenges, we still reset layouts, managed availability and we improved quality.\nThis is a picture of what we refer to as Produce 2.0. Our team was able to implement this last year and they did a great job maintaining the department all year with quality and availability. And there were other parts of the store where we struggled with being in stock, but we saw improvements in the recent quarter and our results reflect that. The in-store experience, it's the foundation of our business.\nNow, I've seen a lot of progress recently specifically in the last quarter. Of course, we also saw major changes to customer behavior last year, including nearly 3x the digital growth we were expecting before COVID. And we believe that represents lasting permanent change. And that\u2019s why, we think this is the time to invest more aggressively in our supply chain, in automation, in technology, and in our people, specifically those in omni-roles as we share today.\nAnd we are showing you the flywheel, so you can see why we feel empowered to make these investments right now. Our overall business is becoming healthier and we have billions of dollars and opportunities that when scaled can drive the returns we need. Yes, our investments are about adapting to our customers who want to shop. But look at our flywheel and understand that it's more than that. We are investing to grow.\nLooking at the center of the flywheel, our top priority last year outside of COVID concerns was to become even more customer driven and we've done that. We combined our apps and many of our services together, we redesigned stores, we launched Walmart+, a valuable and unique proposition that's simplifying customers' lives. And for the past year, we've been working as a combined organization: one merchandise org, one supply chain org, and one finance org for all the items Walmart sells with corporate incentives that are aligned and reflect that.\nWe are now one business, representing how the customer sees us. And we are now better able to identify and attack problems from the mindset of the customer, using whichever assets make the most sense. For example, the bag you see on that porch contains items someone ordered from our traditional Walmart.com site just a few hours before.\nWe\u2019ve algorithms that tell us when a customer's Walmart.com order includes items that are sitting in their local store and when it makes sense, we just pick those items from the shelf and we use our last mile network to drive them right to their home. And most customers are very surprised the first time this happens as they're expecting everything to come in a box a couple days later.\n3,000 of our stores are now doing these deliveries and they've added density to our last mile business and helped accelerate it. And think of the savings on something like a television that we are now able to deliver from a store a few miles away instead of from an FC several states away. And for years, we said that one of our biggest advantages was having 100,000 of the highest demand items within 10 miles of 90% of U.S households. And this is a way we are better leveraging that advantage to serve our customers.\nNow looking at primary destination, I will add last year, we saw the power of EDLP and great items like never before. We just delivered an 8.6 comp for the year. We had a historic fourth quarter that was just shy of $100 billion in sales. Now it's amazing to think about that because in 1993, the year I joined Walmart, we reported about $55 billion in sales for the year.\nWell, last year Walmart grew $40 billion; and in the U.S alone we grew $29 billion, more than half the volume we reported back in '93, my first year. And very different from my first year '93, last year, we picked almost 6 billion items for pickup and delivery. And we were recognized as the most downloaded U.S shopping app.\nThe reason you see arrows on the flywheel is that it's mutually reinforcing. Primary destination is fundamental. Then we grow by deepening and expanding that relationship. We see two fundamental paths to expand general merchandise. One is delivering almost all the Supercenter straight to customer's homes. This is especially important as Walmart+ grows; the proposition will be and should be that you can have almost anything we sell in stores delivered within hours.\nThe new delivery capability I mentioned is a big step towards getting there. Path two is using Walmart.com to expand way beyond the Supercenter in a way that's healthy for the long run. And we made a lot of progress, adding brands such as Lee, Reebok, DKNY and S'well. And this year, we will add many more, some iconic names that I'm very excited about.\nWe have 13 general merchandise private brands that would be classified as $1 billion brands, and three of our apparel lines are $2 billion brands. We're seeing some strong initial progress from the combined merchant organization. Our customers and merchants are now able to benefit as our merchants think about all of our channels, stores, pickup, delivery, first-party and third-party. And that's led to new brands and better buying.\nWalmart.com contribution profit rates for categories have been up year-over-year each and every month since we combined, and we expect that that will continue. Our furniture and mattress business, for example, continues to be one of our top profit-driving categories across Walmart.com and it continues to grow. And we've seen a multiplying effect for things like accessories; customers who buy mattress on Walmart.com are more likely to buy a mattress cover or sheets in a store.\nWe put new emphasis on building on a trusted, world-class marketplace business that dramatically expands our product and services. We've got a lot of momentum and we plan to accelerate it through strategic partnerships with Shopify, ChannelAdvisor and PayPal. And we are working with Judith's team on an international platform to reach customers and sellers outside the U.S.\nHealth and wellness and financial services are on this part of the flywheel, because they're adjacent to our core business. And it's a natural fit with customers. We now have 20 Walmart health centers and with more in the pipeline. And looking at monetizing assets, the marketplace business I just mentioned is a huge opportunity because of what we can offer sellers.\nWe have big goals with Walmart Fulfillment Services and with Walmart Connect, our advertising business, we have a multibillion dollar opportunity when you consider our reach. Our website and app, our TV walls and self-checkouts and our ability to help suppliers place ads outside the Walmart ecosystem. 5 years from now, we expect to be well within the top 10 advertising platforms in the U.S., ahead of big players like Hearst, Fox and Twitter. And Walmart is one of the biggest buyers of media in the country. We understand the relationship between advertising spend and business returns. So we know what marketers want.\nIn terms of the flywheel, the Connect model will grow as other parts of the businesses grow, because we can do things like help marketplace sellers reach target audiences, creatively place targeted ads and buy buttons on digital platforms. And this is something that's happening a lot in other markets, but it's totally underdeveloped in the United States. And as Walmart+ drives loyalty and brings more data, we can help brands create new ads and experiences for our members.\nWe are also very excited about our last mile delivery business. We are now doing about 1.5 million deliveries each and every week from stores, which is more than 7x what we were doing a year ago. We are doing this through a combination of our own Spark Driver platform and third parties.\nWe are quickly getting items to customers and we expect to see delivery costs to continue to go down as we build volume and density. And I'm sure you've noticed that this flywheel is based on foundational components that have always been a part of our DNA in particular EDLC. We are working with a number of suppliers on next generation fulfillment technologies and we are scaling what's working.\nIn our supply chain, we are using robotics to pick and palletize items by store, department and aisle, and this is helped both with productivity and in stock. In stores, we are very excited about our market fulfillment centers, which store and pick both refrigerated and non-refrigerated items.\nWe've actually expanded our picking capacity stores in the past year, but we still have room to grow. But market fulfillment centers make the process significantly faster and more profitable. They move a significant amount of the picking off the sales floor, allowing us to do more within the box. And one of these fulfillment centers can serve a large area spanning multiple communities.\nAnd we're now moving to scale these locations and we expect to have over 100 of these within the next couple of years. And in some stores, we will carve out existing space for them. At others, we will add on. In some, we will build a standalone units. And there's a lot of good work with packaging. And we're also building a supply chain engine to anticipate demand specific to the locations and times. There are literally billions of dollars of opportunities on the table here. And I'm also proud that we have so many members of our technology, product and design teams focused on building tools for our store associates.\nNow, you may remember me talking about Ask Sam, an app that we developed when I was at Sam's Club. It lets associates speak questions into their handhelds and get immediate answers that in many cases save them a trip to the backroom or across the store. We've rolled out Ask Sam at Walmart and one metric that shows you just how much our associates like this app is that once someone starts using it, they ask an average of 10 questions a day.\nAnd the last part of the flywheel is reinvesting in the customer value proposition. And that\u2019s the whole point of this flywheel; how we create the growth and profit pools we need to be an even better retailer. We will keep innovating and we will keep investing where we need to including in our people. In the past year, for example, we doubled the number of our store associates supporting omni initiatives.\nWe restructured to a team based model that's more aligned with an omni focus and we've continued to invest in wages. Today I was proud to inform more than 400,000 people that they're getting a raise, and I know this will lead to an even better customer experience. I'm really excited about our strategy in the future. It's a tremendous opportunity to have the largest retail business in the U.S., growing sales with profitable billion-dollar businesses inside it and to be moving as quickly as we are right now.\nIn just the past 6 weeks, for example, you saw us create a FinTech startup, announce the expansion of fulfillment technologies in stores, rename and expand our advertising business, launch delivery from our 3,000 store and begin scaling vaccinations to do more than 10 million doses per month.\nWe are moving fast, but we have to move fast and we're making the investments we need to move fast. But we hope you see today that we're doing it in a strategic and healthy way. And in a world full of friction we are making life easier for people in a way that's authentic to Walmart. Thank you.\nJudith McKenna\nThank you, John. It's great to see how the flywheel is working and generating continued momentum in our U.S business. Today I want to talk about two things: the universal applicability of the flywheel to our international businesses with a particular focus on Mexico and India and also talk about the changing shape of our international portfolio.\nBut you can't talk about our business without first saying a massive thank you to our 700,000 extraordinary associates in Walmart International. They have stood tall during the last year and served our customers when they needed it most. They are true heroes. And in all of the numbers and strategies you will hear from us, they are the real story in every corner of the Walmart world and they make our business possible.\nThis has been a strong year for the International business. We've delivered strong results. We've reshaped our portfolio, making deliberate choices about ownership for Asda Japan and Argentina. We\u2019ve created new and exciting partnerships, which help build out our ecosystems and we have significantly accelerated growth in eCommerce. In fact, eCommerce penetration of international sales grew by almost 40% last year.\nTurning first to the portfolio, we\u2019ve closed on the deals with Argentina and Asda. And we expect to close the Japan deal in the very near future. That's three major transactions all done virtually with virtual transition plans in place. And I want to specifically recognize the teams in each of those markets for their work this year. A pandemic and a sale process is not easy to manage.\nWe know that we are bringing to life our strategy of strong local businesses powered by Walmart. And one of the key points that makes our operating model unique is that we are flexible. We will find the right ownership structure to be successful in each market, be it wholly-owned, majority-owned, or minority stake.\nWe are also building strategic partnerships through equity investments to support our core businesses. First, in JD and Dada in China and now Aditya Birla Fashion Retail and Ninjacart in India; all great examples. All these structures contribute to powered by Walmart as we learn from those that we have a relationship with, be it through boards, or direct commercial relationships. And that learning is already benefiting the whole of Walmart in shaping our perspectives.\nThe portfolio moves we've made allow us to focus our resources to invest in our growth markets and drive their flywheels. Mexico, Canada, China, and India will all see investments this year. It's all part of building strong local businesses powered by Walmart.\nOur markets may have different structures, but what's common are the fundamentals of the flywheel to drive sustainable growth. At the core, they're all customer-centric and have mutually reinforcing assets that generate innovation, engagement, growth and profitability. The secret is that each one is tailored to the market which it serves. What is most relevant to the local customer and where is the country on its development curve.\nEach market is testing, developing and scaling products and services that builds out a flywheel relevant to them, whether they create them themselves or they adapt from other markets. Over the past year, we've seen exponential growth in eCommerce. We've grown eCommerce sales in China by 89%. We've added pickup and delivery capabilities to hundreds of stores across Canada.\nWe are seeing eCommerce growth in Mexico of 171%. We're processing over $1 billion monthly payment transactions in India with PhonePe. And our recent launch of Flipkart Wholesale, we've brought together Flipkart's core strengths in technology and logistics with Walmart India's Cash & Carry business to help step change B2B retail in India, creating opportunity to support millions of kiranas across the country.\nOur success in eCommerce last year has been in part because of our unique global footprint and the access to markets with some of the most innovative eCommerce and omni-channel ecosystems in the world. In 2020, best practice sharing truly lived up to its promise, bringing powered by Walmart to life. And we were able to leverage skills, technology, and products, and iterate in real-time to serve our customers.\nAround the world, we are making progress to every stage of the flywheel, and especially, in Mexico, where it's been a year of true acceleration. I talked last year about the strength of Walmex and thank you to those of you who followed up after that. It's been another strong year for them. Remember, this is a public company listed on the Bolsa. And earlier today, we presented Walmex results and strategy plans to the market.\nWalmex is a scale business, serving more than 5 million customers daily from nearly 3,500 stores and clubs across Mexico and Central America. Gui and his team have done an outstanding job in an incredibly challenging year with the pandemic and other natural disasters significantly impacting Mexico and Central America. And they have still delivered high growth, strong margins and a very strong ROI.\nWalmex has always been good at boldly innovating within the market. First with Bodega, then bringing Sam's Club to Mexico and now with eCommerce. They are putting in place the elements of the flywheel and seeing results. But I'll ask Gui to tell you in his own words about the business.\nGuilherme Loureiro\nThank you, Judith, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our results for calendar 2020, which we just shared with investors in Mexico this morning. This has been a challenging year for our business and I\u2019m very proud of the way our associates rose to the occasion. They delivered great results.\nWe saw total revenue increase 8% year-on-year in Mexico. We were able to grow 130 basis points ahead of competitors. eCommerce sales grew 171% and we reinforced our leadership in online grocery. Disciplined cost control allowed us to grow more than $1 billion eCommerce business, while we improved an EPS and profitability. We also innovated to expand omni-channel and last mile capabilities across our fleet. Before I go on, I want to remind you of who we are today.\nWalmex is the largest private employer in Mexico with nearly 200,000 associates across the country. We have stores within 10 minutes of 85% of Mexico's population in the top metro areas, and we are a major contributor to the Mexican economy. We have unique strengths that position us to become Mexico's leading omni-channel retailer.\nBy now, you are familiar with the flywheel. And I'm going to spend a few minutes showing you how our flywheel works in Mexico. At the very top, we are focused on winning the primary destination. The shape of retail is changing faster than ever and we are growing differently than before. Our new Bodega Stores continue to be a driver for us. Our growth engine has been strong, efficient comp growth. Last year that was 6.7% with nearly 3% of that coming from our growing omni-channel capabilities.\nWe continue to innovate and move with speed to serve our customers better. We reinforced our omni business by enabling 586 on-demand stores at 1,348 pickup locations and 1,128 kiosks and rebuild 63 stores, opened three new distribution centers, and rolled out our Spark last mile delivery program to almost 30 stores. We also invested to add capacity to our supply chain and drive automation. Going forward, we will double- down on each of these fronts.\nAs we move through the flywheel, our next step is to further extend GM assortment. This year, we will significantly increase the number of sellers in our marketplace. First, focusing on local, then develop through cross-border trade. At the same time, we are creating mobile financial solutions that will further link customers into our ecosystems for payments, credit and remittances.\nThis year, we'll give customers the ability to load their digital wallet with credit and debit cards and choose it as a payment method in our online business. This is a natural build on our omni business that helps us solve another customer pain point, speed of payment and money transfers.\nMoving around, we see cost control and new revenue streams adding further momentum to their flywheel. EDLC and productivity have been core to our business from the beginning. This year we launched this Smart Spend, which allow us to leverage learnings across U.S and international markets. And we are excited about the potential for a high margin advertising business, Walmart Connect, which we expect to grow by 60% in the coming year. All this comes together as we reinvest into our core customer and associate value propositions.\nCustomer expectations took a giant leap forward in 2020. Thanks to the resilience of our team and the flywheel model, we had the resources and agility to accelerate our strategy and leap with them.\nBack to you, Judith.\nJudith McKenna\nGui, thank you. We are proud of what you and the team are doing, and I'm excited to see your flywheel gain even more momentum as we go through 2021. Now I said I would come back to India. And while the flywheel specifics to Flipkart and PhonePe are different to the ones that you've heard about earlier, the concept is just as relevant there as anywhere with a customer-centric ecosystem central to success.\nIt's 2.5 years since we invested in Flipkart, and the fundamentals of why we invested remain unchanged. And we continue to be impressed and we are learning a lot. I am more confident than ever in the work that they're doing to serve our customers in India. And they're building a strong business and helping support economic growth right across the country.\nFlipkart and PhonePe have risen to the challenges of the health crisis. And with digital adoption in all its forms accelerating in India, both have emerged stronger as we entered into 2021 than when I last spoke to you in 2020. Flipkart saw more than 250 million customers over a 5-day period during its recent Big Billions Day event. And PhonePe has just reached that milestone of $1 billion monthly payment transactions. Both businesses have consistently delivered against our expectations.\nFlipkart and PhonePe are part of each others ecosystems, but they are separate businesses. And we recently completed a partial spin-off of PhonePe that we will see each business get its own board of directors and give each more independence.\nSo let me first look at Flipkart. Flipkart's GMV growth was impacted by a 53-day shutdown in the first half of the year. But the business rebounded and exited Q4 with strong momentum, delivering GMV growth roughly double that of the full year. This is a credit to the resilience and the agility of our CEO, Kalyan and his team who were able to pivot and continue to drive growth recognizing the role that they had to play in serving customers.\nAnd at the same time, they strengthened the core business to be more resilient. That agility is not surprising to us because Flipkart is a tech company with customers at its heart. This is a rapidly expanding eCommerce platform with a growing suite of bundled services, a market leading position in categories like fashion, electronics and appliances and a promising ad-tech and wholesale businesses.\nWe believe that Flipkart is positioned to win India's eCommerce future. And I caught up with Kalyan earlier this morning to share more about the opportunity in India and how the team is innovating and building capabilities to deliver that priorities this year. So Kalyan, India remains one of the most promising growth markets in the world for retail, but I would love to hear from you in your own words what makes the market so special?\nKalyan Krishnamurthy\nJudith, India has roughly 1.4 billion people today. 34% of the population are millennials, young people. By 2030, there is an estimate that this young population of millennials and GenZ will be 75% of the total population. 700 million Indians are digital today. And I also want to just quickly acknowledge that Digital India vision of the Government of India, which has actually enabled this. So you have a unique combination of a big market, completely digital, getting wealthier and very young.\nLet me just quickly talk about the eCommerce opportunity also in India, which is a result of the Digital India vision. A few years back, there was an estimate that by 2025 the eCommerce market size in India will be $50 billion to $60 billion. I just read a report from consulting firm Bain & Company that by 2025, the latest estimate is actually $90 billion to $100 billion. That is the real opportunity we are looking at in India today.\nJudith McKenna\nIt's remarkable, isn't it? The step change that\u2019s happening and has happened, and we could see that when we invested 3 years ago. But what I've loved seeing is how Flipkart has grown and lends into that shifting behaviors really. What is it that makes Flipkart so uniquely suited for this moment?\nKalyan Krishnamurthy\nJudith, let me just first give a headline on Flipkart. We are a company built by Indians for Indian consumers. Roughly 300 million customers shopping 150 million product listings across 80 categories. We are the leading product marketplace in India today. Flipkart is known for local innovation. If you just look at the last 7 to 8 years in commerce in India, in general, I would say, a huge number of innovations across commerce in the last several years have come from Flipkart. And Judith, this is not just in one area.\nWhen you open the Flipkart app to shop, everything you'll there -- see there. Just the access, searching for products, digital payments and the way you receive products, everything is innovated for the local Indian consumer. That's what Flipkart is all about.\nVery quickly, just talking about some innovations, which we are very proud of, which just happened in the last couple of years. Flipkart today offers five native languages in which you can actually get access to the product catalog of Flipkart. We recently also launched voice-enabled shopping, which is very unique in India today. So these are some of the big innovations which we've done in the last few years, Judith.\nJudith McKenna\nYes, I just love the innovative nature of this and the fact that you're absolutely designing what\u2019s right for the Indian customer. But it's more than just a platform though, and there is so much more to what you're doing as well, isn't there?\nKalyan Krishnamurthy\nAbsolutely, Judith. I think what people see in the world when they open the Flipkart app, it's just an app with a lot of products there. But behind the scenes, there is a few things which is really enabling all of this. First is, talent. We are so proud of having the best of best talent in India. Actually our engineering talent, technology talent is actually a global talent sitting in India.\nOutside of that, if you just look at the top investment areas for Flipkart in the last few years which will actually continue into the next few years will be in technology and infrastructure, supply chain through Ekart, which is among the largest consumer supply chains in India today.\nJudith McKenna\nThat\u2019s incredible, isn't it? And the way that you've used Flipkart -- Ekart and integrated it has been amazing. And it just reminds me when you talk about innovation and some of those areas, just how quickly you and the team turned things around. You were shut for 53 days during last year due to the pandemic, and I remember them well. Many of the challenges that you faced in 2020 really you reacted so well to them and you actually finished the year even stronger than you started despite everything. What was it that really made a difference for you and the Flipkart team?\nKalyan Krishnamurthy\nSure, Judith. It's a great question. While 2020 saw great customer adoption, we saw an acceleration in the business, but it was actually not about the business in 2020. It was all about safety and partnerships. And once again, we were really inspired by the Government of India. They are the ones who initiated this trade-off in favor of safety. We worked with our employees, our ecosystem partners and invested heavily in safety. And this is not just financial investments, infrastructure investments, education to all our ecosystem partners and employees on safety.\nSecond is, we over indexed on partnerships. We were very clear quite beginning -- in the beginning of the year itself that in a pandemic like this, actually it will be easier for bigger companies to pull this through, but smaller partners, ecosystem partners of Flipkart will actually find it quite difficult to get on the other side of this. So we invested in partnerships in a big way. We once again invested not just financially, we actually listened to them, spoke to them and understood what they really wanted. So it was a big year for partnerships.\nTo your specific question, we absolutely saw an acceleration in customer adoption. Customer is at the core of Flipkart, and that's the way it has been for the last several years. In the beginning of the year, we saw several new insights come up for Flipkart customer insights and we saw some new trends emerging which was not there before. The meaning of the essential categories people were shopping for was evolving very rapidly. So once again, we worked with our seller partners to make sure that we\u2019ve the right selection for the consumers which is evolving in 2020. So that was another big priority.\nFinally, we also used this opportunity to actually completely rearchitect our financials. I would summarize 2020 as a year when we got closer to our seller partners, closer to our consumers, a more clustered employee brand, and finally, more financially prudent.\nJudith McKenna\nYes, that's great. And I couldn't put it better myself. And I think what was really fascinating to watch is the way that you reacted in the moment to what you needed to do, but you're really keeping a long-term view of how the company could evolve and grow in different ways. So let's look forward now to 2021 that we are already in. What priorities are you thinking about as you continue to build out your ecosystem and really think about driving growth for Flipkart?\nKalyan Krishnamurthy\nSure, Judith. Actually, once again, just mentioning the point I mentioned before. We are very, very good at listening to our customers. That's the core of Flipkart. And one big insight which we\u2019ve seen in the last few years is that India as an eCommerce market is evolving from trial list consumers to loyal consumers. So one of the biggest challenges we've taken on ourselves is how to have a very strong value proposition for our loyalty program. So Flipkart+, which is a very uniquely local loyalty program is one very big priority.\nSecond is grocery as a category is something where we want to strengthen our value proposition, especially partnering with the roughly million kirana partners we already have in our ecosystem. Fashion is a very big category in India, underpenetrated digitally. So we want to actually capitalize on that opportunity. And finally, as I mentioned before, technology and infrastructure will be two very big investment areas next year and going forward.\nWe are also experimenting with more and more revenue models. For example, continuous investments in our advertising platform, which is among the top five advertising platforms in India today. Overall, Judith, I would summarize Flipkart and India as a big, big opportunity ahead of us. Of course, there are challenges, but we are up for the challenges.\nJudith McKenna\nIt sounds fantastic. Thank you so much for joining us today. I'm really excited about what the future Flipkart looks like. And huge thank you to you and the team for everything that you've been doing through 2020 and are going to do in the years to come.\nKalyan Krishnamurthy\nThank you, Judith, for the partnership.\nJudith McKenna\nThank you, Kalyan. We are really looking forward to seeing your progress as you bring the next 200 million Indians online. Now let's move on to PhonePe. The Indian government's vision for digitization really comes to life when you think about payments.\nUPI was launched in 2016 and has enabled extraordinarily rapid growth. In fact, I recently read that the UPI value of transactions is now equivalent to 15% of India's GDP. That growth is remarkable. And as the market leader UPI transactions, PhonePe is enabling access and inclusion for hundreds of millions of Indians right from their phones.\nLast year, we spoke about PhonePe's ambition to build capabilities that allow Indians to spend, manage and grow their money. So I'm excited to introduce Sameer, Co-Founder and CEO of PhonePe. So update on where the business is along that journey? And also talk about that focus on being an open platform innovating for our B2C and B2B customers and on developing new revenue streams?\nSameer Nigam\nThank you, Judith. It's been another year of significant progress for PhonePe. But what stood out for me the most during 2020 was the sheer resilience of Indians during these testing times. Here is a short video showing just that. [Video Presentation]\nLast March, while India was under a strict national lockdown due to COVID, in true PhonePe spirit, hundreds of our employees worked together and launched the I for India donation campaign to help raise money for the PM CARES Fund. Our month long national campaign helped raise more than $6 million from 1.6 million donors.\nPost-lockdown, our offline sales force resumed the hard work to digitize kiranas and small businesses across India. PhonePe has already added 16 million merchants to our digital payments network. This year, we have set a target of creating over 10,000 rural jobs to scale our merchant network to 25 million small businesses across all 5,005 semi-urban and rural districts in India.\nLast year, we also started focusing heavily on building customized business growth solutions for India small businesses and kiranas. We launched a store discovery platform on our consumer app. It helps consumers discover and chat with all the local grocery shops, pharmacies and other essential service providers.\nWe also launched PhonePe ATM, a service that allows small retail shops to double up as ATM centers where consumers can make quick petty cash withdrawals instead of having to visit banking ATMs that are miles away from their homes. More than 2 million merchants signed up as PhonePe ATMs in 2020. All these product innovations in 2020 have helped make our PhonePe business mobile app top 10 business category app in India that has been downloaded more than 10 million times already.\nOn the consumer side too, COVID related lockdowns and social distancing needs have really accelerated the consumer shift in favor of digital payments, which is here to stay. India is witnessing unprecedented growth in digital payments adoption, and our own transaction volumes reflect this growth. PhonePe now has more than 275 million lifetime registered users, which essentially means that one in every five Indians now has PhonePe. Our monthly transaction count is up nearly 100% year-over-year. Our MAU has crossed 110 million monthly users with a very healthy 97% monthly customer rupee trade.\nEven in terms of monetary value, our annualized TPV run rate has crossed the $300 billion mark. At PhonePe, we continue to be a very small lean organization that harnesses the power of technology to transform lives positively. We obsess about building simple scalable and innovative product for every Indian. We are now applying the same philosophy to build what we hope will become India's most comprehensive financial services platform.\nI'm happy to report that our mutual funds category now has users spanning over 90% of the PIN codes in the country. We are also India's fastest growing InsurTech platform, having sold nearly 1 million insurance policies since March 2020. We started this company in 2016 with a vision of building India's best digital payments company. Today I'm very proud to report that PhonePe is leading in India across most key industry metrics, active users, active merchants, total transactions and TPV.\nBack to you, Judith.\nJudith McKenna\nThank you, Sameer. The team are doing some truly amazing work. So finally, let me reemphasize our key takeaways for International. Firstly, the shape of our portfolio is changing and we are focusing our resources on markets where we see the greatest opportunity for long-term, sustainable and profitable growth; strong local businesses powered by Walmart.\nSecondly, Walmart International has a unique global footprint and is able to move with speed, thanks to our access to innovation around the world. And finally, the flywheel applies no matter the shape or nature of our businesses. Building an ecosystem of mutually reinforcing assets with the customer at the center is our path to win the future of retail across International.\nNow I\u2019m delighted to have the opportunity to introduce Kath McLay, CEO of Sam's Club U.S. to talk about the Sam's Club format, which has also been a real powerhouse for us in International. I want to personally thank her and her team for the knowledge and learnings they continue to share about Sam's Club across our business.\nOver to you, Kath.\nKathryn McLay\nThanks, Judith. And you're going to hear me talk today about how we are leveraging those learnings across the enterprise. This year, the warehouse channel has thrived in the U.S. and abroad. Consumers tend to warehouse clubs that could provide larger pack sizes and fewer trips.\nAnd at Sam's Club, we were ready with a strong omni foundation to serve members how and when they needed us. Our associates turned up to take care of our members and serve them in an omni way during this most unusual period. These patterns were consistent across the globe, driving growth in Sam's Club in the U.S., China and Mexico.\nIn FY '21, our club format recorded $75 billion in sales. We have great momentum. And now, we are accelerating. Today, I'm going to talk to you about our business in the U.S., but I'm also going to talk to you about Sam's Club in Mexico and China led by my colleague Judith and the country Presidents in each market.\nWhile they are separate businesses, we are working together in ways that make our strong businesses even stronger. In the U.S. and abroad, Sam's Club is growing. That growth is driven by our focus on items and omni convenience. The power of the warehouse model and strengths of Sam's Club were even more evident during COVID. The effort we put into investing in tech and improving our item quality really paid off this year.\nLet's turn to the U.S. Comp sales excluding fuel and tobacco were up 15.8% in FY '21 and transactions increased by 8.9%. Families also responded to our contactless omni offerings like direct-to-home shipping, curbside pickup and Scan & Go. Equipped with these digital tools, Sam's Club saw tremendous membership growth and hit out the NPS of an all-time high. This all added up to a banner year for membership in the U.S.\nWe added 6x the number of members than we did in previous years. We also saw a full 100 basis point improvement in our renewal rates. You can see how that adds up to a 9.4% increase in membership income, our greatest annual increase in six years. We are confident that we have the right offer to keep these members and attract even more, while working the model to grow profits.\nTo explain why, let's walk through the warehouse model. Great items at disruptive prices are fundamental to the model. Sam's Club is an item business with a curated SKU range, so every item matters. Our merchants are experts at finding great items that members rely on and the unexpected products that members are excited to discover.\nLast year, we added more than 200 national brands like Beyond Meat, Casper and Kola. This coming year, we're making significant investments in digital tools that will arm our merchants with the best data so they can predict trends and select merchandise that seems handpicked for our members.\nOur Members Mark private brand continues to be vitally important in all our Sam's Club businesses. We know from our data that members who purchased Member's Mark are more likely to renew. So we want to continue to be hyper-focused on quality and innovate to build a bank of items that delight.\nI want to tell you about a few of my favorite Member's Mark items. Let's start with our shuffleboard and dining set. This is definitely the item no one knew they needed, but everyone wants as soon as they see it. Our senior merchant noticed members were responding to multi-function items.\nAnd during COVID, members were looking for at home entertainment. So she worked with the supplier to create an on-trend dining table that is not only a 12-foot shuffleboard, but a bowling game as well. And with six tools, marine quality decking and an included cover for just $1,899, it is already a hit with members. There is nothing else on the market like it, but just the shuffleboard and chairs alone would cost $3,000 at another retailer.\nAnother one of my favorite discoveries are our danishes, and they highlight our merchant's commitment to quality. I've done a blind taste test with one of our competitors, and our version wins every time. This pastry went through a complete overhaul inspired by member feedback and a competitive review of similar items across the country. Our new recipe is exclusive to Sam's Club. We created with carefully sourced ingredients on European equipment to ensure the traditional processes are replicated. It is made with 100% butter and the dough is twisted by hand.\nSince we launched this recipe as a three pack for $2.98 last summer, sales are up 270%. And with the new supplier production facility coming online, we expect to double our sales this year. Great items drive the model. But it really starts to work when our merchants and operators buy for less and operate for less so we can offer disruptive prices.\nI am really proud of how our merchants and operators are working together to drive efficiencies across the club. We are simplifying our buys to make it easier on our associates and drive productivity. For example, we streamlined our freezer/cooler category by removing SKUs and increasing the number of full dual presentations for on-trend items, like our frozen acai bowls to reduce labor.\nYou've heard us talk about our apps like Sam's Garage and Ask Sam, which as John mentioned, is now at Walmart. We have a lot more where that came from. We have apps for inventory management, for planning, for emergency operations, for pickup and more. These tools drive incredible productivity and allowed us to handle unprecedented sales volume growth this year, while maintaining a high NPS score.\nThis is no easy feat. One example, is the Fresh app. Earlier this year, we rolled out a major enhancement using machine learning to improve production planning of our fresh offerings, like the danishes as I talked about earlier and other items we prepare in the club. We streamlined the process from eight steps to three and significantly improved accuracy. We're more efficient, we sell more and we produce less waste. And what used to take 8 minutes, now takes 30 seconds. All of that adds up to save labor costs so we can invest back in price.\nNow let's talk about convenience. Earlier, I talked about our omni offerings, Scan & Go as well as curbside pickup and direct-to-home. All three of these offers saw significant adoption increases in FY '21.\nLet's talk about my favorite, Scan & Go. Looking for a safe way to shop, members flocked to this tool in FY '21. Penetration for Scan & Go increased by 560 basis point. We built on this strength with the launch of Scan & Go Fuel in the fall. This launch significantly boosted adoption. Many members tried Scan & Go Fuel sparking use of the tool in the club as well. As you know, these products are transferable to the rest of the formats, and Walmart is now using Scan & Go too, launching it as part of their new Walmart+ membership. We will continue to innovate on Scan & Go, and you will see us testing some exciting new features this year to make this clever tool even better for our members.\nI'm also proud of our curbside pickup offer. At the onset of the pandemic, we listened to our members and launched a concierge service in just six days. That allowed our members to shop our assortment without having to leave their vehicles. Not only do this provide a critical service for our members when they needed it most, it helped inform and accelerate our curbside strategy.\nWe quickly launched curbside pickup across the fleet in June. We have seen curbside orders increased triple digits for the year. We've expanded our GM assortment and we have more than doubled the capacity to meet strong member demand. Members love this service. It has an NPS of 80, a significant increase since June.\nWe are not just focused on digital convenience though, we are committed to making the omni experience come to life in the physical environment as well. Last year, we piloted a new look and feel in a few of our clubs. The new branding is modern and minimalist, while highlighting the best things about Sam's Club, our incredible items and our omni offering.\nWe've already made these updates in 56 clubs and plan to hit half the fleet this year and the remainder next year. We will continue to accelerate here to maintain our leading position and make shopping Sam's Club the most convenient experience in the channel.\nI want to talk briefly about ways we leverage Walmart scale at Sam's Club, and in turn, how we export Sam's Club assets throughout the enterprise. As part of Walmart, Sam's Club can leverage best-in-class services and resources like supply chain tech and procurement. This helps us keep our SG&A low so we can invest in digital tools and convenience that sets Sam's Club apart from the competition. Abroad, we've taken a great brand and made it successful in China and Mexico. And what we've learned in these markets helped us make the whole enterprise stronger.\nOur Mexico and China businesses have adopted tools that worked well for Sam's Club in the U.S. Mexico launched Express Membership, which allows members to sign up in 1 minute something that used to take 15 and is currently testing Ask Sam and our Fresh app. And we have expedited the member sign up and renewal process in Sam's Club China through our WeChat Mini program.\nWe also worked together to share items that will be relevant across markets under the Member's Mark label and leveraged supplier agreements to lower costs for both private and national brands. In 2020, our global leverage program helped launch 700 new items in Sam's Club in Mexico and China. We have some really high performing clubs in Mexico and China. And we expect to open as many as 30 new clubs between the two markets over the next 3 years.\nIn closing, you can see we are excited about the Sam's Club business and we are building on fabulous momentum. Abroad, we will continue to innovate while building clubs. And in the U.S., we will remain an item business with a focus on quality, price and assortment that continues to build on our strengths. An incredible team of associates, a winning model, a culture of innovation and digital assets that set us apart, all of this comes together to increase member advocacy that will continue to fuel growth.\nThank you. And now, I will turn it over to Doug.\nDoug McMillon\nThanks, Kath. Now let's talk technology. I'm joined by Suresh Kumar, our Chief Technology and Development Officer. I know many of you had a chance to meet him at last year's meeting. He has been busy. He and his team are leading the effort to modernize our tech stack, put our data to work and build new capabilities and income streams. Suresh, last year we shared our plan to modernize our tech stack. Please tell everyone about our progress.\nSuresh Kumar\nThank you, Doug. Absolutely. So last year we talked our approach to moving faster and taking advantage of the developments in machine learning, artificial intelligence and other new technologies. Now these modern technology elements will enable Walmart to move with speed, be innovative and become more productive.\nNow we are modernizing our tech stack on an innovative hybrid cloud platform that is uniquely suited for Walmart, and I'm really pleased with the level of progress that we have made in this area on several different fronts. Now first, we added a lot of great talent to our tech team. We've brought in senior leaders from across the industry. And this has really created a deep domain expertise as we start building out more modern applications.\nSecond, we\u2019ve been aggressively upgrading our infrastructure. We upgraded more than 50,000 servers, and that's allowing us to take advantage of the latest hardware and software. Now we also upgraded more than 2,000 stores to 1 gigabit per second fiber connection. And what this is allowing us to do, we can run machine learning and data workloads like computer vision and augmented reality, which demand a lot of bandwidth right inside our stores.\nNow but more than anything else, we have doubled down on our move to the cloud. We ran 100% of our U.S. eCommerce and Sam's customer journeys on the cloud this past holiday. And we also ended up building a data lake in the cloud and migrated more than 1.7 petabytes of data into it, and this is allowing us to run very advanced analytics in a very efficient manner.\nAnd lastly, we rolled out our cloud power checkout system to nearly 23,000 point-of-sale devices. And by the way, this is the same technology that powers the contactless customer experiences that Kath talked about in Sam's. So this migration to the cloud really has been at the center of our modernization efforts this past year.\nDoug McMillon\nThat's really good stuff. To me the highlights are the team we've assembled and the fact we stayed on schedule with all of those things during a pandemic and you worked remotely to get it all done. It's just amazing. A lot of the work that you just described though was necessary for kind of the mid and long-term, but we are actually already seeing some benefits from the modernization now. Would you share some of those?\nSuresh Kumar\nWe absolutely are. The most visible benefit was how we handled the volume surge when the pandemic started. Now our every day volume level started to rise and it rose to levels even higher than our prior holiday peaks and well above anything that we had seen when we started running holiday shopping events.\nNow migrating to the cloud allowed us to keep the site available for our customers, while operating lot more efficiently because we could scale up and we could scale down in a very seamless manner. Now, second, supply chain scaled very well during the holiday. We lit up over 2,500 stores to start delivering online orders, in effect, turning our stores into fulfillment mode.\nDoug McMillon\nVery cool.\nSuresh Kumar\nAnd we could do this, by the way, because we built a system that crunches millions of pieces of information to find the fastest and lowest cost node to deliver a particular order to a very specific customer. And of course, this is a huge win for our customers and for our business because not only did we deliver to customers a whole lot faster, but also at a lower cost.\nDoug McMillon\nOur store associates enjoyed doing it too.\nSuresh Kumar\nAbsolutely. And another big benefit of modernization and using new technologies is actually for our store associates. Now John mentioned Ask Sam, and this is an app that uses natural language processing. We've also started testing out a new app that we called [indiscernible], and this one uses augmented reality.\nWhat this does is it directs our associates in the backroom to very quickly identify what needs to be taken upfront. And using this app, associates are able to take only one-third of the time to complete a task which they previously had to do by scanning each and every case.\nDoug McMillon\nThat's huge.\nSuresh Kumar\nAnd by the way, these are just a few of the examples that illustrates the benefit of the work that we are doing. We are enabling the business to move with speed, become more productive and we are innovating on customer and associate experience.\nDoug McMillon\nYou and the team did some incredible things in 2020. For example, supporting the surge in eCommerce was amazing, but what are you most proud of?\nSuresh Kumar\nSo, Doug, when the pandemic hit, we found ourselves needing to deliver a new set of urgent priorities to help our associates and to help our customers. So, for example, we had to scale our VPN capabilities by 600%, our videoconferencing capabilities by over 100%. What this allowed us to do is to enable our corporate associates to work remotely without skipping a beat.\nNow, similarly for our customers, we delivered on features that allowed them to shop safely and conveniently, everything from contactless shopping options, COVID testing, site support, to delivery prescriptions. We launched over 100 features, big and small, to enable shopping during COVID. What I'm really proud of is how our team continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives, our tech modernization efforts, while at the same time innovating actually with speed to deliver on COVID-related business features that were needed to serve our customers and our frontline associates.\nDoug McMillon\nYes, your team stood tall in 2020. Looking forward, we are changing our business quickly and we are building new capabilities with tech playing a key role. What are some of the things that excite you the most?\nSuresh Kumar\nSo I continue to be excited about the work that we are doing with machine learning. It's helping us both improve efficiency in the business, and it is transforming our customer and our associate experience. So, one good example is how we manage our assortment. We built a machine learning model to optimize the timing and the pricing of markdowns. And this one effort alone saved us $30 million in markdown costs.\nDoug McMillon\nAwesome.\nSuresh Kumar\nNow, of course, we are going a whole lot further. We are building algorithms to better forecast demand and to optimize both the location and quantity of inventory, so that we reduce the need even to have markdowns in the first place. Another key area where we applied ML is in facilities maintenance. We now have an automated system to review thousands of proposals and invoices every day, and it does it for accuracy across multiple dimensions, like historical labor hours, costs of parts, travel time. And then the system recommends the ones to either approve or to reject. And our associates in real estate use the recommendations to increase proposal and invoice accuracy, and this has resulted in savings of at least $40 million last year.\nOne more example is on the pharmacy side where we have been building out our data lake so that we can run ML models on top of it. We took out millions of dollars of costs by improving our supplier agreements and by improving our merchandising choices. We analyzed agreements to see where we could buy a whole lot more effectively. But at the same time, we recommended what drugs could be added to our $4 generics program. And of course, this helps strengthen our customer offering, while at the same time improving our cost position.\nSo I've highlighted a few areas, but the power and the potential of ML is applicable in every single thing that we do and that is something that I'm really excited about.\nDoug McMillon\nMe too. And really appreciate those savings, by the way. Now, let's talk about priorities. What will you be focused on looking ahead?\nSuresh Kumar\nYes, so Doug, last year was building about foundational capabilities, about accelerating the modernization work, to enable the business to go faster, to become more innovative, and become more productive. This year onwards, it's going to be about unlocking the future of shopping for our customers, meeting them in the shopping journey in a highly personalized omni fashion. In fact, we want to start serving our customers right when they start consuming content, social commerce.\nNow, on our associate side, we want to reduce the time that they spend on activities like inventory counting, making multiple trips to the back room for stocking, picking, all of this kind of stuff so that they can focus on serving our customers. And we are focused on building systems that optimize all aspects of inventory and do that in real time. Everything from how we get inventory from our suppliers, to keeping our products in stock, to fulfilling customer demand in the fastest and lowest cost way possible.\nWe want to enable our merchants to focus on the art of merchandising, have the systems take care of everything else. The foundation that we\u2019ve built is truly helping us reinvent how we serve our customers, how we run our business. Really excited about the potential that we can unlock.\nNow, as I said in the beginning, technology will enable Walmart to move with speed, be more innovative, become more productive. And we see our role in technology as powering Walmart to lead the next retail disruption. And of course, that is well under way now.\nDoug McMillon\nIt sure is. Suresh, thank you for everything your team is doing. Thank you for the momentum that you're building. We covered a lot today. Thank you for your time and attention. Our focus is on our customers, on people, on the families we serve. And we are excited about getting even more aggressive. We have a strong, deep team and we will execute. We will strengthen this company in a way that benefits a lot of people for a long time to come.\nNow, we would like to give you a 5-minute break to grab a coffee and stretch your legs and when we come back, we will have a Q&A session that will include Brett, John, Judith, and Kath. Thank you all.\nDan Binder\nThank you for joining our second Q&A session today. Just as a reminder, please unmute your Zoom when we call on you. With that, we will go to our first question from Oliver Chen with Cowen. And from there we will go to Ed Yruma at KeyBanc.\nOliver Chen\nHi. Good morning. Thank you very much. Regarding technology, what are some of the learnings from India that will be most applicable to the U.S and also curious about edge computing and how that may play a role in thinking about leveraging stores in technology there?\nDoug McMillon\nYes. Judith, do you want to kick that off and maybe John, you can comment.\nJudith McKenna\nYes. So, hi there. I think that the leverage from India is really understanding how they're building out that ecosystem. We are starting to really see the difference that they're making for India in the way that they're joining together different bits of the platform that they've got and building out a flywheel albeit different to the flywheel that John described for the U.S.\nWe've got some interesting things happening. They're building out our tech, for example, as well. Now, that is a developing market, so slightly different to the U.S., but we're just about to start a trial in our Chile business using the Flipkart Ad Tech app, which is really helpful to a similar kind of market to be able to trial out two benefits to that. The first is, of course, Chile benefits from that, but secondly Flipkart learn how to produce commercial-grade tech which potentially might have a future for them as well. So, we learn a lot, it's not just about the tech, but about how they approach things, and about how they're building out a broader flywheel as well.\nJohn Furner\nYes. Thanks, Judith and Oliver, good to see you. Thanks for the question. Now, I think I would just frame up the answer by saying one of the extraordinary things about Walmart is we are local in about 5,000 communities, and that's been extremely advantageous in the last few years, but particularly last year as our teams did so much to serve communities all over the country.\nAnd this local presence has so much meaning in terms of being real in the community, our ability to serve customers in a number of ways whether it's picking up in a store, shopping in a store, using our local facilities as points of distribution and with the supply chain investments we are making.\nAnd your point on edge computing, it's a great one and it certainly does open up real possibilities for us considering we've got these properties all over the country where we're within about 10 miles and 90% of the population. And going forward, I think that's a huge advantage whether it's in our core retail business or some of the other income streams that we covered this morning.\nDoug McMillon\nAs it relates to edge compute, Oliver, this year's focus was on increasing the pie for the bandwidth into a lot of our stores because we imagine future use cases along the lines of what's Suresh talked about just a few minutes ago with an app that you can hold up and see which merchandise to pull forward. We will use handhelds for that for a period of time someday we may have wearables and we can imagine other enterprise users in addition to that example. And there may be excess capacity to monetize on top of that, we will just have to see how much we need ourselves.\nDan Binder\nThank you, Oliver. Next we will go to Ed Yruma and then to Greg Melich after that.\nEd Yruma\nHey, thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first, you guys have kind of layout some very rough outlines and some interesting developments in your distribution capabilities. Can you talk a little bit about micro fulfillment, the last mile investments, are you seeing a step change in terms of the consumer that wants items delivered versus pickup and how does that change the longer term profitability of eComm? And then as a follow-up, you guys have done a great job kind of reformulating your international mix. How do we think about contribution longer term. Now you've tipped into kind of higher growth markets? Thank you.\nDoug McMillon\nJohn, I might kick it off just by saying we made a deliberate choice years ago to focus on pickup in the U.S before focusing on delivery. We were doing delivery in the U.K and other markets, and Judith, we we're learning a lot from what Asda had done with delivery. But in the U.S., we thought, based on how large the country is and how people like to drive their cars and they do drive throughs for food and banks and everything else that we had the opportunity to really focus on pickup for a few years, which was obviously advantageous to us economically and those capabilities which we couldn't pay software from Asda to get started, which is great, those capabilities, actually, John, worthy unlock to productivity for delivery, which you're building on now.\nJohn Furner\nYes, I'm really glad that that work was done a few years ago, Judith, because it created the foundation for what is enabling what we are doing today and really just step back and think about what happened with the customer last year. The pandemic changed behavior in some ways, I'm sure it's temporary, but in many ways, these are permanent changes. And customers having the ability to shop in a store, or pickup, or deliver at their schedule or an attended or even within 2 hours of things that we are doing all over and if it weren't for the pickup capabilities that were happening in the store, all that wouldn't be possible today.\nSo we talked about the growth of the last mile delivery. And that's always just a function of volume and density and neighborhoods and the more density you have, the more economic it is to deliver an entire range of goods. But we are excited about those businesses. You also mentioned local, what we're calling MFCs, market fulfillment centers.\nI'm really excited about the capabilities that adds for a couple of reasons. One, it will increase capacity. The increased capacity also helps stores manage what's going to be done on the sales floor, and what will be done in the fulfillment center. And then those fulfillment centers, they can serve broader areas including other stores. So the way that we are tying all the supply chain assets together with automation, and our fulfillment centers down to the last mile up to the point of delivery to and including inside the home. It's a really exciting proposition.\nDoug McMillon\nThe fact that we've attracted more new customers with the pickup and delivery services is also helpful. I think, there are a lot of folks who weren't shopping Walmart in the stores that once those services were available, they were excited to take advantage of them and try them and Kath that include Sam's Club where this year you've added a lot more curbside capacity.\nJudith McKenna\nYes. So we rolled it out across the whole network in June and have seen it successfully grow week on week ever since then. I'm excited to kind of explore how we can leverage synergies with Walmart from a delivery perspective, moving into the next year.\nDoug McMillon\nI think, it's one of the drivers of membership growth, the fact that people could take advantage of Sam's without coming into building during the pandemic.\nJudith McKenna\nMaybe just -- do you want me to pick up on the International and the growth piece? I will just build on the point that John was making, which is we're learning around the world by the way from last-mile delivery. The Spark platform that we have got, we got that starting in Canada. We got it delivered in Mexico. So, this is not just a U.S thing. This is around the world as well and the capabilities that we are building. A pretty universal and I think that's one of the unique things that we have.\nAnd the International mix, yes, we\u2019ve done a lot of changes this last year in International, you know the Asda deal just closed this week. And we are more focused on high growth markets as well, and each of those markets is a different place in its portfolio. So I'm excited to see how we continue to contribute to Walmart overall. But as Brett said, you will see us with the higher sales positioning than you\u2019ve seen in the past. And I think also businesses that are really building out and growing for the future as well.\nSo it's an interesting and unique global footprint that we have got, the priority markets continue to be as they have always been, with Mexico, China, India, and Canada, but also we see strength in Chile and Africa coming back as well.\nDan Binder\nThank you. Next we will go to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. You are on mute, Greg.\nGreg Melich\nSorry about that. Hope everyone is doing well in the weather there. I guess, two things. First for Brett, it's great to hear a CFO excited. And I guess what, one or two levers should we look to going forward to get the profit margin growing again into 2022 and beyond, if you were to pick all the initiatives you see out there?\nAnd then my second question, I think is for almost everybody, probably Doug, John, not really sure. If you look at that eCommerce business now, $65 billion how much of it is 3P? And as you get to $100 billion or $200 billion, how much you think that mix will change? And do you ultimately need to have your own drivers and assets to really scale the business? At what point of scale, would you need to have your own trucks drivers like in Amazon? Thank you.\nBrett Biggs\nI'm glad you picked up on my excitement, Greg. And actually the question you asked is why I'm excited and very optimistic about what we can do as a company, because when we look at where we want the company to be financially, 2 years from now, 3 years from now, 5 years from now, there's a lot of different ways to get there. It doesn't have to take one track and that's what's so important with the other income areas that are growing significantly, Judith just mentioned International growth being more significant than it's been in the past. There's so many initiatives going on at Sam's Club that are driving sales and profit and membership. And then go to John's area, and there's so many things from talking about, again, the new revenue streams but also the general merchandise business, marketplace, and there's just a lot of ways to get to the place we want to be. Greg, if I go back several years ago, maybe that wasn't quite the case. I just like the optionality that we have as a company. I think it's -- it just opens up opportunities for us.\nJohn Furner\nAnd Greg, on your question on mix, it reminds me back years ago when we were in general merchandise businesses and the Division 1s -- what we call Division 1 stores and then we bought grocery chains and we added those together and we created this magic mix of the supercenter. And as the formula started to work, we accelerated investments up to about 350 stores a year. And then if you think over the last 8 to 10 years or so, we had the Orange app, which we talked about, which was the copy of the Asda app.\nWe had our Walmart.com app does have come together and that same sort of mix equation, it's really exciting to see it play out and for our merchants and we've got a fantastic merchant team. Now that they are in a position to have a category or a group of items or group of categories and be able to mix those across channels and channels being everything from 3P that's fulfilled by us 3P fulfilled by the sellers, then we've got our 1P commerce business which was strong last year and our store business, the lines are really starting to blur. And it's all about resetting how we think about the customer and offering the customer the very best experience across all the channels.\nAnd so having a 3P business, it's growing like it is and fulfillment services we see demand from sellers is accelerating. And we are really making sure that we think about sellers as a customer. I\u2019ve been spending time on Zoom calls, unfortunately we can't have meetings together, but my team and I\u2019ve been meeting with some of our largest sellers and we are listening to all the things that they need from us and we are enabling those capabilities so that Walmart can be a great platform for them, just like it is for suppliers and customers and all of our associates. So, this ability of our team -- for our team to be able to mix across channels in addition to the categories they serve is really exciting as we look forward.\nDoug McMillon\nJohn, maybe a little bit more on last-mile. Our current arrangements includes Spark, our own independent contractor platform, which has been scaling and growing. We also have relationships with others that do this similar type of work. You've had some experiments going on with AV here locally there is a vehicle that's running around some experience with drones now trying different things, anything more on density or how you see last mile going forward?\nJohn Furner\nYes. For sure. Look, the customer is the boss and customer is number one. We've said that for years and what we\u2019ve to be able to do is deliver the way the customer needs to have a delivery done or fulfill the way they want to and it really depends on what's going on their life. So thinking about taking a neighborhood where we have got a number of customers who are customers of Walmart, who need to stay in stock or need to be delivered to, in addition, the same neighborhood will have people who are looking for a gift for a birthday for that week or they are inspired by some sort of content they saw online, whether it's someone else's platform or on our platform to be able to have density in neighborhoods is really important.\nAnd that includes items that will come from fulfillment centers and sellers and local stores, all of that down to the experiment, Doug, you mentioned which is we have got mans that are delivering in density here locally. We need great partners like FedEx for their runs that run from fulfillment centers, straight to people's homes. And then we are experimenting with aerial delivery, including drones. We have done COVID tests this year in communities. We have been able to launch some new items and deliver the first units sold from stores to places with drones.\nAnd so, Greg, I think the answer is, we're going to keep learning as we go. Some of these things we know are ready to scale. We have talked about mark fulfillment centers, our last mile businesses, it's over 1.5 million deliveries a week now, which is up about seven times from last year, which is exciting. And it's a really healthy blend of service providers and the Spark platform which enables people to drive on our behalf and behalf of others like Sam's Club in the future.\nDoug McMillon\nGreg, like we do with our private fleet there are loads that we want to move. There are times when we use third parties to move those. I think, there'll be a hybrid approach here. Some mix of our assets and a whole lot of relationships with others to build out the entire network.\nDan Binder\nThanks, Greg. Next we will go to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett, and then to Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan after that.\nChuck Grom\nGood morning. Great, Thanks, everyone. Couple of questions from me. First, for Brett, COVID costs last year were around $4 billion, curious what's the embedded run rate this year and the guidance that you provided this morning? And then also how would you size up the wage costs headwind that you also announced this morning, relative to that $4 billion?\nAnd then second for, John, on related, I'm curious how you are planning the year from a category perspective, which areas do you think are going to do well and what areas of your business do you think we could see the release of some pent-up demand? Thanks.\nBrett Biggs\nYes. I will kick off, Chuck. Good to see you. So what we tried to do with guidance this morning, we said we are trying to give you best view we can given what we know is pull you up a little bit to a higher level. As we get down into the individual pieces of that guidance, there's a lot of different things that could happen in the year and how quickly do the vaccines take over and how quickly do we need to continue the cleaning and maintenance that we are doing that will continue for some time, we know that.\nSo out of the $4 billion, there was a number of one-time bonuses that obviously is in that number and then there is a run rate in there. So, we do have a run rate going forward, obviously we have run rate on wages, getting into the details of that is not something that we are prepared to do this morning. But it's taking all of that, and looking at the variables that could cause one to go up, one to go down and then just looking at the most likely scenario and that's what we feel like we gave you this morning on sales and profit and breaking it down further in that, just we are trying to do that this morning.\nDoug McMillon\nProbably the number one thing we need to get done is we need to get the country vaccinated.\nBrett Biggs\nYes.\nDoug McMillon\nSo, there's a lot of effort and -- time and attention into how we can help scale that effort. I think John, we are maybe 22 states last week, you might talk a little bit about vaccinations and the role we're playing as you talk about categories.\nJohn Furner\nYes, sure. Well, Chuck, good to see you. And, Brett, the year last year was extraordinary in a number of ways, and I do want to just thank our team for being so committed to safety and cleaning and it was an enormous lift everything from sourcing mask and like we've got today putting up plexiglass in 5,000 locations. They move mountains and we really did great job, they really did a great job of prioritizing associate safety customer safety and serving communities now which leads to vaccinations.\nWe are here ready to help all across the country we've got close to 20,000 pharmacists and pharmacies ready to participate. And we've got capacity, well over $10 million, maybe up to $14 million per month that we can help to do so, we want to help to get the country vaccinated because it gets us moving back in the right direction. And the sooner we're able to do that the better it is for the economy and every part of the country.\nChuck, on your question on mix, just think back to last year, the swings are pretty wild and they had impacts that stayed with us for some time. Last year in February, we saw people buying more OTC, in March, it was a big run in grocery in the stock up phase and then the general merchandise really took off at the end of April and into the second quarter and which resulted in a very, very high number of out-of-stocks and we really struggled with conditions and in stock for a couple of months because of the surges.\nSo reflecting on what's happened this last quarter, it was a strong quarter. Growth was up 8.6% and they're also really proud of the team that the plan we put together, they were able to not only beat the -- the plan that they had, but grow at that level while being closed at day that we were open last year. We closed on Thanksgiving Day and that had an impact. We were just short of $100 billion for the quarter and I think that just a few more hours, Brett, probably would have made the difference.\nBrett Biggs\nYes.\nJohn Furner\nBut if I had to make the same decision again, I'd make the same decision and I would close for our associates who needed some time off. But in this last quarter, mix was pretty balanced. The food business, the consumable business was stronger. Health and wellness had a great quarter, and general merchandise also had a great quarter, which we saw nice share gains in November, December in general merchandise. So, what happened late in the quarter was a more balanced mix of categories than probably what we saw back -- different points of the year last year.\nDan Binder\nThanks, Chuck. Next we will go to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. And then the Paul Lejuez at Citi.\nChris Horvers\nThanks. Good morning, and thanks for all the information. So, first, a question for Brett, and then I'll have a follow-up on PhonePe. So, in the 4% plus sales contract beyond this year, how are you thinking about the Walmart U.S. comp? And bigger picture, historically, you've been sort of a mid single-digit type earnings grower. Is the message today that with faster sales growth and the potential for more margin expansion that we could be thinking about more like a high single-digit type earnings algorithm long-term?\nBrett Biggs\nYes, Chris. Good to see. As you think about the 4% given the size of the business in US, you're not going to get to that number with pretty good growth in the U.S and you're seeing a lot of the capital that we're putting forward in fulfillment, innovation, automation, making sure that we can grow the top line in the U.S as quickly as we can. That's what we want to do. But having said that, International still being a big part of the business and having now a higher growth mix inside of International, that also helps as well.\nOn the profit side, as I said this morning, we expect over time to grow operating income faster in the sales and that\u2019s what you should expect from us as investors. There is a lot of different ways to do that. One of the things that I believe will look a little different going forward is the pieces on gross margin and higher margin businesses, these evolving and growing new businesses we have higher margin mixes, general merchandise business getting stronger, helps mix that out as well as our contribution margin gets better in eCommerce that helps us well. So it's all these pieces starting to come together that gives us the opportunity to grow operating income faster than sales, which has been a little different than we've been in the past few years.\nChris Horvers\nUnderstood. And then as a follow-up on PhonePe. Can you talk about what are your longer-term thought process there on the strategy? Are you thinking about this as an opportunity to scale it globally to take some of the learnings back to other markets. And so thus it's a longer term commitment, or do you see this over the long-term as a monetization that provides fuel to reinvest in the core business. Thank you.\nJudith McKenna\nHi, Chris. Listen, PhonePe is an amazing business in its own right. It's -- Doug, and I were just reminding ourselves, it's just 4 years old and this time last year, when we were talking to all of you, I was wowed at the fact I could say it was doing 0.5 million -- 0.5 billion -- sorry, 0.5 billion transactions a month. And now I'm talking about them doing a billion. I think that just tells you the scale and the way that it's growing.\nWe are really excited about what the long-term future for PhonePe looks like. That continuing on that strategy, which is send, spend, grow and manage, and we're supporting them through that strategy, as well. This has been a year where they consolidated and really thought about India. It's been a remarkable year in India overall and digital adoption in all its forms have stepped on, in particularly, on digital payment. So they\u2019re very much focused on the Indian market. At the moment, what the future looks like, they\u2019re helping us, advising us the markets like Mexico. But at the moment we want them to focus on India.\nThe thing I think that we did this year which is interesting for them is we did a partial spinoff for them. And the reason for that is we\u2019ve two amazing business with Flipkart and PhonePe and what we were trying to do is set both up to maximize their potential in the long-term, so they can both build value. They can also really think about having dedicated capital which helps growth opportunities.\nNow, PhonePe is monetizing, as it goes through this. Like you\u2019ve heard consistently today, it's got an Ad Tech platform, many of the new areas such as mutual funds and such as insurance are accretive to them. But they are still in a growth phase at the moment. And one of the things actually that we shouldn't overlook and what we did this year is that we have now been able to create their own ESOP for that business, which best aligns them and the management team to what the future for them will look like. So we are very much interested in the long-term for them, but, yes, there will be a lot of learnings around the world.\nDoug McMillon\nI think financial services is core. And we've got a great opportunity in India. We've had a financial services business obviously in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, other places. And it's so integral to commerce and create so many different use cases and opportunities to deepen the relationship with the customers save the money, which we've done well over time, but it's been more store-centric than what the future will look like. And because we want PhonePe to be focused on India primarily, we've taken a different approach in the U.S. John, you might elaborate more on it.\nJohn Furner\nYes. So, we announced a FinTech start-up with Ribbit Capital. We are really excited about that. I think ultimately having a great platform like Walmart, where people are looking for better ways to pay and pay in an omni-channel way, just really opens the doors for us to think creatively about a marketplace of products and services that are great for customers' financial wellbeing. And that's all possible because of the underpinning of our ability to create a trusting environment where people buy their food, they get their health and wellness services, including clinics from Walmart. And ultimately, this along with some of the other businesses we talked about, which I heard in your question, we're really confident that not only we have a path forward in some of these new areas but also in others, we've really got to path to scale. Things like the ad business, it's a sizable business that's growing fast and has a lot of room to scale.\nAnd just putting us at the center of the question, why is it possible because you have suppliers, you have sellers, and you have customers, all looking for ways to connect. So suppliers need services to reach customer groups, sellers need to reach customers and sellers need to buy from suppliers. And at the center, that was the reason that we decided to rename our business, which was we referred to previously as Walmart Media Group to Walmart Connect, because it connects those three parties together where they can get on with it and have a great business together.\nDan Binder\nThanks, Chris. Next we will go to Paul Lejuez at Citi.\nPaul Lejuez\nHey, thanks guys. Lots of attention on wages tends to be on the SG&A piece of the equation, but I'm curious if you could talk about what you see from a top line perspective in seats where there has been some wage pressure in recent years. Do you see a sales lift in those areas. And then separately, just curious how you're thinking about the top line drivers in 2021 from a store over eComm perspective, traffic versus ticket perspective. And I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you comment on what you expect in terms of e-Comm profitability in 2021 versus 2020. Thanks, guys.\nJohn Furner\nProbably a few things in there to unpack. So maybe, let's start with the associates at Walmart. And for years we've been really proud of the fact that we provide career opportunities, over 70% -- almost 75% of our managers start as hourly associates. I started as an hourly associate in 1993. And we're really proud of the career ladder. And as we step back and looked at, Chris, what's really happened in the last couple of years in stores specifically, we've seen that the work has changed because the way the customer shops has changed.\nSo when Doug was talking about starting pickup back in the U.S., Judith probably 6 years ago or so, around 2015, that was a pilot experiment. It's now a sizable part of not only how customer shop, but it's what we do every day. So we took a step back and looked at the store and broke the store into really four big work groups. And the announcement this morning is to invest in two of the most critical work groups as we look to the next few years and that's stocking the store, maintaining inventory levels, and I'll talk about that in just a second, and then our digital business. What we're referring to it as the omni business, but it's really the pickup and dispense business, which includes dispensing to customers' cars or to delivery drivers. And so that's the way the customers are going to go. We're going to stay ahead of it.\nBut When it comes to inventory availability, we've got to be right each and every day in stores for the in-store shopper and the picker who is trying to put an order together and dispense to a customer. And last year, different parts of the year, we had times of the year where we were proud of our in-stock position. We had other times where we had extreme pressure in the supply chain. And that would include availability, surges in business, we had the stock up phase, which left us in a position of out of stocks for a long amount of time.\nAnd so it's the right time for us to invest in those groups of associates and create a great career map for them. So that they not only want to come to work and stay with us, but they see future opportunities, including being a store manager, or being a regional operator, or being the CEO one of the businesses. So what we're trying to make sure we're doing is invest in a way that it's really clear to an associate who starts at Walmart this week, what their opportunities are, and how they accomplish it.\nDoug McMillon\nWage inflation generally speaking is good for us in every country where we operate, it's good for us in the United States. If a market is going up, it's also good for us if our associates wages are going up and they have more disposable income we're obviously the first place they think of. Many of them are working there every day. So we do want to see wages go up. We just got to get the pace right all things considered. And as it relates to eCommerce, Brett, do you want to comment on that?\nBrett Biggs\nYes. So as we said, that's been moving definitely in the right direction. We reduced losses this year significantly in the eCommerce business. And it's such an integrated part of our business. You did not miss it. We did not give guidance going forward on that. But you can imagine with the growth and profit algorithm that we laid out this morning, without continued progress in that, it would be tough to grow operating income faster than sales. So that should give you some indication of -- we assume that progress will continue.\nDoug McMillon\nWe just these days think of it as an omni P&L \u2026\nBrett Biggs\nYes.\nDoug McMillon\n\u2026 even more than ever. So we are -- I think Brett's done a nice job explaining it today, all these different pieces and variables. And we look at it holistically. And as we've shared before, we've got a cadence that we work through to manage the financials to decide where we're going to step on the gas, where we're going to be more conservative. The eComm P&L we won't lose sight of. We will still track obviously GMV sales, contribution profit by category, the fixed costs. We've got great visibility into that. But the customer relationship pulls stores and eComm together. And generally speaking, we are thinking about this as a holistic in omni business, not in silos anymore.\nDan Binder\nThanks, Paul. That's going to conclude our Q&A session. We do appreciate all of your good questions. Doug?\nDoug McMillon\nYes, I'll just close by saying thank you. I mean, we know so many of you and appreciate the time and attention you pay to the company. Hopefully, most of you are aligned with our view. We are building this for the long-term, we are going to manage the short-term. There have been times these past few quarters where we've been able to have a positive surprise to the upside. We are going to go to work. We are going to execute. We are going to build for the long-term and manage the short-term as we go and you guys can give us feedback and hold us accountable based on the actual results. So we will get back to work. Hopefully, we will see a little bit of a warmer temperature around this part of the world and get a lot of our stores back open and get customers back in them and build from there. Thank you all.\nBrett Biggs\nThanks, everybody.\nDan Binder\nThat will conclude our program. Thank you.\n\n",

My name is Connor, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the HubSpot First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nCharles MacGlashing, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nCharles MacGlashing\nThanks, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to HubSpot\u2019s first quarter 2016 earnings call. Today, we\u2019ll be discussing the results announced in the press release that was issued after the market closed. With me on the call this afternoon is Brian Halligan, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and John Kinzer, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we start, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement included in today\u2019s press release. During this call, we\u2019ll make statements related to our business that may be considered forward-looking, including statements concerning our financial guidance for the second quarter of 2016 and the full-year 2016, our position to execute on our growth strategy including development and adoption of our sales platform, and our ability to maintain existing and acquire new customers and partners.\nThese statements reflect our views only as of today and should not be considered our views as of any later date. Please refer to the cautionary language in today\u2019s press release and to our Form 10-Q, which was filed with the SEC on May 4, 2016, for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nDuring the course of today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. There is a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results, currently available in our press release announcing financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, which is located on our Investor Relations website at HubSpot.com.\nNow, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to HubSpot CEO and Chairman, Brian Halligan.\nBrian Halligan\nThanks, Chuck. Hi, everyone and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call.\nLet's jump in and get straight to our results. HubSpot kicked of 2016 a very strong no. First quarter total revenue grew 54% and subscription revenue grew 57%. In addition to that outstanding growth we delivered 10 points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement and 7.5 points of operating cash flow improvement over last year, really good start.\nUnderneath these results we're seeing some exciting progress with our serum product in the sale side of our business but before we dive into that let's take a moment to talk about our marketing business.\nThe HubSpot core marketing platform is growing strong and I believe we're still in the early innings for our marketing product. We had 1206 customers in the quarter bringing us up to 19,322 total marketing customers.\nOur average subscription revenue per customer grew an impressive 18% year-over-year. Our customers are spending more with this upfront and then succeeding in moving into higher contact tiers and purchasing second URLs in our new add-ons.\nOur revenue retention was just a hair under 100% in the quarter as those up-sells nearly completely offset customer trend. Those are all great financial results but even more rewarding the opportunity here have a combination of HubSpot software, our service in our inbound methodology continues to just work for our customers. It's not just here in the U.S. we're doing it all over the world.\nOur international business continues to see phenomenal growth. In fact HubSpot international revenue accelerated to 80% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of 2016 and now represents 26% of HubSpot's total business overall.\nOur Dublin and Sydney offices are cranking. Our news office in Singapore is ramping up fast. And our Japanese office is on track to open in the third quarter of this year.\nOur product is now fully functional into five languages and since December we've actually seen a fivefold increase in the usage of our non-English versions of the HubSpot marketing platform, Laza [ph].\nNow, many of you have heard me describe the three eyes of our go-to-market strategy. They give us such an unfair advantage in the mid-market and gives us a lot of confidence that our model will scale over the long haul.\nWe use inbound versus outdated outbound tactics. We use inside sales versus hiring expensive outside sales reps and we have an amazing indirect channel that gives us great region scale with our customers that would be pretty tough to replicate.\nAs for our indirect channel, we welcomed over 180 new partners to the HubSpot program last quarter bringing us to over 3,100 total partners that are signed up to grow with our business and help our customers embrace inbound with HubSpot.\nWe're really excited be welcoming a bunch of our gold, platinum and diamond partners to our offices both in Cambridge and Dublin next month for our partner days. I love, love, love working with our great partners.\nOkay. Let's talk about the CRM product and what\u2019s going on with the sales business. Let's start by talking about why we decided to go into the sales business in the first place? First, I'm the first to admit that I'm a bit of a sales geek. I grew up my career to the sales ranks, cold calling leads and banding on doors. And back in the mid-90s you could make your career of doing that. Work like a charm.\nThat playbook just doesn\u2019t work anymore now. The change we saw was that the buyer today keeps gaining more and more control over the sales process, the Internet and social media have produced a wealth of information that buyers never had access to before. And that\u2019s the three big shifts that are changing everything for the sales professional of 2016.\nFirst, prospecting has changed. Not long ago everyone had phones on their desk and none of those phones had caller ID. It was a golden age for cold calling and back in the 90s I spent every Tuesday cold calling all day at a really good connect rate and I filled my funnel that way.\nIn 2016, not a lot of people have phones on there desk. Here at HubSpot I sit with the marketing department out of the 40 people that sit in my wing of the office only four of them have phones on their desk including the executives. And of the four who have phones every one of them has caller ID. If they do not recognize the number that\u2019s going I bet you they don\u2019t answer. Call me crazy, but I think old-school prospecting is dead.\nSecond, account control has changed. Back then I had everything I needed to help my prospects make a decision; pricing, product specs, connections with other customers, connections with executives in my company and more. Every time I give them a piece of information I leveraged it to gain more control on the account.\nBut in 2016 the prospect of all of that information from the company's website, from LinkedIn, from core, the list goes on. I don\u2019t control access to that information at all anymore. Call me crazy, but I think old-school account control is dead.\nThird, we used to live in a buyer beware world. The buyer needs to do tons of due diligence ahead of time and if they made a bad purchasing decision, well it was to just too bad for them. It was a buyer beware world.\nToday it is the exact opposite. We now live in a seller beware world, where if you twist the arm of the buyer and the product doesn\u2019t live up to what you said it would do, two really bad things happen.\nFirst, the buyer complains, loudly. There's an unlimited amount of outlets for people to say they are unhappy about a product or company. On top of that huge change, many industries have moved from large upfront purchase prices to everything in your life being much more of a subscription based sales. So it is a lot easier for them to cancel and you are out of a sell when that happens. Call me crazy, but I think the old-school buyer beware world is dead.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to build a new type of sales tool that works with, not against the shift in the world. The HubSpot sales platform empowers your company to treat customers with the respect they deserve. This radical change in the balance of power is so similar to the transformation we saw in marketing a decade ago. That's why we're investing so heavily in this business.\nSo we're now a year or two into the building of our sales business and boy we have learned a lot. When I think about any business I like to visualize and analyze it from an S-curve perspective. The first phase of development of the S-curve is getting to product marketing.\nCan you build something that leads one human being on the planet will spend some money on? Once you get there, the second phase, is can you make the math work to grow the business, can you acquire X number of customers consistently show at least a 3 to 1 return on investment.\nThen the last phase, the growth phase, does the math actually scale. Can you pour a lot of investment in the top of this thing and not have the math fall apart. We are big on unit economics around here.\nSo where does our sales business sit on the S-curve today? Well, we have nailed product markets if the product is selling, what's even better is you can actually sell it off, hefty portion of our sales business comes by the way of nearly touch less sale.\nFor phase 2, can you make the math work? Our lifetime value to cost to acquire customer ratio in particular has continued to strengthen over the last several quarters which is the key component of success in phase 2.\nBecause of the time and effort we put into this phase, we are increasingly confident as we step on the gas and invest in phase 3 this business will scale and scale economically too. The model is solid and based on the progress thus far the math is really working.\nAlong the way at the S-curve we also learned that while the $10 sales product showed some promise in attracting the customers the economics just weren't there for us to scale in the long term.\nSo we made the decision last month to stop selling the $10 product to new customers and focus all of our investments on our $50 product which we recently re-branded from sidekick to HubSpot sale.\nNow let's talk about our go to market approach for HubSpot sales. It all starts with the HubSpot CRM. Our CRM product which is a free product is really the channel that feeds the $50 HubSpot sales product not unlike how our direct and indirect channels powerfully feed our marketing business.\nSo now you're probably thinking, come on Brian, everyone in the brother offers a CRM nowadays. How can HubSpot differentiate itself in such a crowded market? Well, I'll tell you, the cost to evaluate, adopt and purchase CRM systems for many mid-market businesses can be prohibitively expensive.\nIn contrast HubSpot CRM is free and offers a simple, no or low cost installation. Our features, price point and seamless integration with our sales and marketing products are unmatched and just tailor-made for a small or medium size business looking for their first CRM.\nThe last points incredibly important at the end of 2015 nearly 60% of the users that adopted our CRM product were not using a CRM at all before that. And all of this up and it is not hard to see why HubSpot has the second most popular CRM offering on the market according to G2 Crowd, only a year after we launched the product.\nSo the proof is in the pudding as they say and I think our approach to CRM for the market starting to really pay off. So what does this mean for our $50 sales business? Well, it turns out the CRM users tend to be an incredibly good fit for our paid sales product. This has put us on track to exceed the $10 billion revenue run rate exiting 2016 that we discussed just a quarter ago. While it still early innings, in mid to high teens percentage of our marketing customer base has already purchased a HubSpot sales product.\nThis is an incredibly important trend for HubSpot over the long term as the early dated suggest that we can expect to see a couple point uplift in revenue retention when a customer subscribes to more than one HubSpot product.\nOkay, enough of me talking about the sales business. What better way to hear about our early success in CRM and sales than from a customer who is using this stuff every day. You know by now how much I love sharing our customer stories.\nThere was a point where I have even invited a customer to join in an earlier investor call. But what you probably don\u2019t know is that the senior leadership team holds customer calls each month so we can all hear directly together from our customers what\u2019s working and what isn't.\nWe recently had the pleasure of catching up with Rosie Moth, a co-founder of Telux HD, a B2B voiceover IP telephony platform based in the U.K. Personally I found Rosie\u2019s journey with HubSpot over the last couple years to be the most fascinating part of the conversation, because it is so clearly illustrated the power of our premium go-to-market approach we have taken with our sales and CRM products.\nA few years ago, Rosie's cofounder Murray came across the HubSpot marketing platform. He showed it to Rosie and wondered out loud if it was worth taking a look. Despite being somewhat interested, Rosie actually decided to stick with what they had cobbled together with point solutions on the marketing side. Telux had already invested a ton of time in making those puzzle pieces fit as best they could in time the resources were tight. It happens, we cannot win them all.\nWell, a few months later, HubSpot released our Sidekick product, Rosie's prior due diligence in this nifty little Sidekick tool makes a decision to purchase it much easier. So, hey, HubSpot it is. Telux adopted Sidekick, rolled it across the team and became a HubSpot customer.\nAnother eight, nine months went by and Telux was ready to start growing their sales team, so it was time to get serious about a CRM system. After little bit of research in Rosie's words, quote, \u201cIt is a no-brainer. It is a highly rated free CRM and they are works with this tool that we love, who is going to say no to that so we didn't.\u201d\nOkay. Fast-forward another six months and Rosie happens to be at a Grow with HubSpot event where she witnesses firsthand the whole HubSpot stack working together and she just gets it. She is sold. She leaves mid presentation to find her HubSpot rep, schedules a full demo for her team, within a few weeks Telux is up and running on the professional version of the HubSpot marketing product as well.\nAnd then a few weeks after that, when they see how well the marketing product is working for them, Telux sales team upgraded their Sidekick license to our HubSpot sales product and they are off. I could go on and on about how much we love customers like Rosie. And of course, we are thrilled the teams like hers keep increasing their spend with HubSpot overtime.\nBut what I really love to see is how this demonstrates again the power of inbound, the product stack and our go-to-market approach. We have seen the number of customers that adopt the sales or CRM product first and then purchase our marketing product doubled since late 2015.\nProducts like HubSpot Sales Pro and HubSpot CRM help customers like Rosie and her team get better every day which just further validates the whole inbound business model. Be helpful be human, it\u2019s all for the customer every day.\nThanks to Rosie and the Telux team for taking the time to share their story with the HubSpot team. Again we just love to your customer success stories, what HubSpot lives for.\nSo to wrap up, we a quarter into 2016, I feel very good about the momentum we have in both our marketing products and our sales products. I'm particularly excited to see the seeds of our early broad platform strategy taking hold. We are in this for the long haul.\nIf you have heard our investor calls before you probably heard me paraphrase the Warren Buffett quote about sitting under a shade tree today because the seeds planted years ago. Well I am optimistic that the seeds we are planting today will be providing shade for us for a long, long time.\nLet me turn it over to John now to take us to the financials and our guidance.\nJohn Kinzer\nThanks, Brian. First quarter was a great start to the year for HubSpot. As Brian mentioned, first quarter revenue grew 54%, driven by 57% subscription revenue growth while services grew 25%.\nKeep in mind that 1Q and 2Q 2015 benefited from one time large services engagement. HubSpot ended the quarter with 19,322 marketing customers, up 31% year-over-year.\nCustomer growth remains robust even as we have seen the anniversary of the improvements we saw in the underlying customer retention. Average subscription revenue per customer continue to grow rapidly, increasing to a $11,494, up 18% from the first quarter of last year.\nSubscription revenue per customer continues to benefit from customers adding contacts to their database, upgrades to our add-on products and an improving mix within our install base, as our smaller customers tend to churn at a higher rate than those that stick with us.\nDeferred revenue continue to grow strongly at 57% in the quarter. Calculated billings defined as revenue plus the change in deferred revenue for 1Q 2016 came in at $67.8 million, up 55% versus the first quarter of 2015.\nSimilar to the benefit that average subscription revenue per customer is seeing, calculated billings continues to benefit from our smallest customers with shorter billing terms turning at a faster rate than our larger customers.\nAs we have discussed in the past, billings growth will vary from revenue growth due to factors such as billing terms and the timing of revenue recognition versus billing. Given this dynamic, investors should be careful relying on billings growth as the direct predictor of the port revenue growth.\nNow, let's take a look at margins. Non-GAAP gross margins improved 200 basis points sequentially to 77% in the first quarter, driven primarily by a 270 basis point improvement and subscription gross margin to 84%.\nThe improvement in non-GAAP subscription gross margin came from new IT automation tools we rolled out in the quarter and a consolidation of our resources that allowed us to take advantage of new Amazon server types.\nNon-GAAP services gross margins came in at a negative 18% and were lower in the first quarter due to higher expenses, as we ramp up headcount for our sales business, international expansion and to deliver recurring services in our marketing businesses.\nMargin pressure will continue to in Q2, but services gross margin should improve in the second half of the year, as services revenue starts to catch up with the investments we are currently making.\nLonger-term, we expect steady state services margins to range from a moderate loss to breakeven. Despite headwinds from the beginning of the year payroll recess, non-GAAP operating margin improved 200 basis points sequentially to a negative 6% margin in the first quarter of 2016, which exceeded our own expectations. The sequential improvement came primarily from the 200 basis point increase in our non-GAAP gross margins.\nInternational performances continue to be strong in the quarter growing 80% year-over-year. International now represents 26% of our total revenue and should continue its strong growth given our recent global expansion. We achieved this growth even with the impact of the weaker euro, which had a negative impact of two percentage points on our overall revenue growth.\nIn the first quarter 2016, we had 250 employees outside the U.S. and a total of 1,312 employees at HubSpot. As I discussed on the last call, we continue to build up space to meet the needs of our expanding headcount and in the quarter we invested heavily in our facilities in Cambridge, Dublin and Singapore. CapEx including capitalized software was a $8.1 million in the quarter.\nOperating cash flow was $3.2 million in the quarter given our strong bottom line performance. Given that over performance we expect 2016 operating cash flows as a percentage of revenue to come in at the high end of a previous guidance of 4% to 5% while CapEx as a percentage of revenue will run closer to 8% versus our prior forecast of 7%. The slightly higher CapEx is largely result of our ongoing office space build out in Cambridge, Portsmouth and Singapore.\nWith that, let's dive into guidance for the second quarter of 2016. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $61 million to $62 million. Non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of a loss of $5.8 million to $4.8 million.\nNon-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.14. This assumes approximately 35 million basic shares outstanding. For the full year guidance of 2016, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $256.5 million to $259.5 million.\nNon-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of a loss of $24 million to $21 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.59. This assumes approximately 35.2 million basic shares outstanding.\nA couple of items to keep in mind as you adjust your models. As you think about 2Q revenue growth keep in mind that 1Q revenue growth benefited from the extra leap year day. Our inbound conference is in 4Q this year instead of 3Q which will impact marketing expenses and cash flow timing relative to prior years.\nIt will also impact 3Q billings as the third quarter will not have the same tailwind as the prior years from the inbound conference. CapEx will continue to run high into Q2 due to the facilities build out and then moderate in the second half.\nIn summary, as we discussed when we went public we will continue to invest to grow our business as long as our customer economics remain strong. At the same time, we're committed to delivering ongoing margin expansion.\nYou can see this playing out in the quarters we delivered 54% revenue growth, narrowed our non-GAAP operating loss to 6% and delivered over $3 million of operating cash flow.\nAs Brian discussed, we have a tailor-made go to market model with the three eyes, in bound, indirect and inside sales. They continue to grow and scale the marketing business. And now we're adding a whole new rapidly growing sales business, well, you can understand why we're so encourage for our future.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Brian for his closing remarks. Brian?\nBrian Halligan\nAnother month HubSpot will reach an interesting milestone we will celebrate our 10th anniversary as a company. When Dharmesh and I started down this path we have big ambitions. Somebody told us back end we would have a publicly traded company with 1,300 employees, nearly 20,000 customers worldwide.\nWell, I am pretty sure we would say we thought they were crazy. For all 10 years, we basically have the same mission. Help transform the way people market and sell to match the way modern humans actually shop and buy.\nEvery year at our inbound conference we get to meet these folks and see how we have impacted there lives for the better. It's a noble mission and we're very proud of it. Along the way we have accomplished something else I'm incredibly proud of.\nAlong with the entire HubSpot team we've created a remarkable place to work in an enduring culture that inspires and enables people to do their best work. It\u2019s the secret of our success and success of our employees, of our partners and our customers speaks far, far louder than words.\nSo, thank you to our customers, thank you to our partners and employees and thank you to our investors. And we hope you'll stick around to see what the next 10 years will bring for HubSpot.\nThank you, operator you can open the call for Q&A.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills\nWell thanks guys and congratulations on the nice quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit about ASP, you said contacts and upgrades were good, our channel checks are telling us from partners that ads and the websites in particular are also ramping nicely. I wonder if you could comment a little bit on how those two ramped during the quarter.\nBrian Halligan\nBrad, it is Brian, thanks for the question. The add-ons are going well. We announced the reporting add-on at inbound version 1 reporting add-on and we announced the ads add-on which was embedded inbound and that is in addition to the website add-on. So, those three add-ons and sort of the technical add-on we have as well have gone pretty well.\nThe reporting add-on has gone very well, the website add-ons continue to do well. We have added a bunch of functionality there and have made a very solid, very happy with the website add-on.\nWe just added to the ads add-on the ability not only to buy advertisements on LinkedIn but also Google AdWords and we really just did that a couple of weeks ago so we expect that to really pick up. So, overall feeling pretty good about the add-ons, it is going pretty well and we expect a bright future there.\nBrad Sills\nGreat, thanks. And then one if I may also on the sales business, you mentioned that about 60% of those customers weren\u2019t running anything prior. How easy is it for you to make that pivot from marketing into sales, is there a different selling motion there, if you can comment a little bit about how you're kind of go into market with sales versus your traditional marketing? Thank you.\nBrian Halligan\nYeah, that is a really good question. It is a different sales motion and it\u2019s a very exciting sales motion. So on the marketing side, there\u2019s really two channels. We have a direct inside sales model that works very well and we have an indirect reseller model that works really well.\nOn the sales business, we have a lighter touch model and a much lower cost to acquire a customer and a large percentage of those sales customers are coming in with little or no touch. So it\u2019s very exciting for us in we sort of developed a third go-to-market highly scalable model to bring to market.\nI think one of HubSpot's real keys to success so far has been that we are very good at matching our go-to-market strategy with our target market. We're focused on that mid-market and we've got a really fine tune, nearly perfect sort of new type of go-to-market to match it. So, stay tuned, I think a lot of exciting things are going to come out of that sales product.\nBrad Sills\nGreat. Thanks Brian.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStan Zlotsky\nGreat. Good afternoon guys and thank you so much for taking my question. Two questions if I may. First one, for Brian, maybe, we all saw the momentum around subscription revenue for customer but maybe just qualitatively characterize first the momentum you're seeing within the size of the customers that you\u2019re bring on board now versus maybe a year ago?\nAnd then a question on renewal rates, very impressive just a hair under 100% on renewal rates, what are your expectations of as we go through the rest of the year and that's obviously not for Brian. So, thank you very much.\nBrian Halligan\nI'll take the first one. Good question, Stan. In terms of the target market, still similar sized companies and they're just buying more products from us and they're buying a little bit more upfront and then they're buying more as they go along.\nAs they grow, their contact database grows, they pace a little bit more money. We come out with some additional compelling products like our reporting add-on, or ads add-on in our sales products.\nSo, its more we're getting a larger share of wallet and delivering more value and the pricing has come up to kind of match that. I'll hand it to you to completely that.\nJohn Kinzer\nYeah. So, Stan, its John. So, on the retention side, we had just over 100% in the fourth quarter just under 100% in the first quarter. We feel comfortable in that high 90s around 100% for the foreseeable future. I think if you think about it at longer-term, what it would take to get it up above those it would be a couple of things.\nOne, continuing to add new products, we've just come out with add-ons; it's the first time we've really had new things to sell into. We're starting to sell the sales product back into the marketing business, that's a nice lever for us going forward.\nAnd finally, there could be new products, we could bring out in the future as well. But I think in the high 90s around the 100%, we can grow really fast and we don't have to replace that part of the business that\u2019s its leaking out when your base can be neutral, everything you sell just leads to growth.\nStan Zlotsky\nPerfect. Thank you very much guys.\nJohn Kinzer\nYes.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.\nBrendan Barnicle\nThanks so much, guys. Brian, I want to follow up on the comment you had on sales. You said, I had my notes here mid to high teens percentage, is that the target of where it will be in terms of sales?\nBrian Halligan\nSorry, can you clarify the question?\nBrendan Barnicle\nYeah. You had mentioned about your goal of getting to a $1 billion and in that, I think you said something about the sales product as a percentage of that sales was -- and I had like mid to high teens. Is that what you were referencing? Or is that that's not a portion of the install base your current revenue that's coming from the sales product, correct?\nBrian Halligan\nCorrect.\nCharles MacGlashing\nYeah. So\u2026\nBrian Halligan\nThis is Chuck.\nCharles MacGlashing\nThis is Chuck. We didn't mention anything about a $1 billion run rate in sales or what sales would be as a percentage of that pace to the extent that we do reach at, or else maybe you misheard the prepared commentary.\nBrendan Barnicle\nYeah. No, I must have misheard it because I \u2013 that\u2019s what I have here in my notes and I have to see the transcript and see where I confused. So, sorry about that. John, when we look at Q2 billings, I know you're not guiding to that, but given some of your commentary any reason at all that wouldn\u2019t continue to grow sequentially?\nJohn Kinzer\nYes. Sequentially, yeah, obviously, we do not guide to billings as a number. It takes \u2013 there is a bunch of things that go into that. I think that the underlying business is still growing strong, we've seen nice uplift to the revenue per customer, customers are still growing strong and we feel good about where that is, but we don't give a specific guidance to billings growth.\nBrendan Barnicle\nLastly then lastly John on Professional Services margin those were a little bit weaker this quarter anything going on there that we should be aware of?\nJohn Kinzer\nYeah. So that\u2019s -- Brendan we obviously are mostly focused on our subscription revenue growth and the subscription margins and it was really great to see the up-tick on the subscription margins given some of the things we are able to do on the hosting side. So we are pretty encouraged on that front.\nOn the services margins, we talked about breakeven to a slight loss, a little higher this quarter on the loss side. There is a couple of things ramping up for international, some of the, we did invest a little bit on the services side for the sales business as well. But we expect those margins to improve throughout the year but we are never going to maximize those margins.\nOur services business is really to make sure that our customers get up, get running and are successfully on boarded, so that they can continue to be really successful with inbound marketing.\nBrian Halligan\nAnd Brendan this is Brian.\nBrendan Barnicle\nTerrific.\nBrian Halligan\nI think what you may have -- maybe miss heard was what we said was a mid- to high-teens percentage of our marketing customer base has already purchased the sales product, that might have been the mid- to high-teens.\nBrendan Barnicle\nYeah. That\u2019s what I was looking for. Perfect, thank you.\nBrian Halligan\nYou got it.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill\nThanks. Brian just back to the annual subscriber revenue, that 18% was the highest you have had in two years. And I think when you look at more buying, more clients buying more add-ons but also have the mix shift from Pro to Enterprise was the -- are you seeing any difference between those up taking Enterprise or is it just the same proportion taking Pro but they're starting to add-on a few of these new solutions around the fringe?\nBrian Halligan\nI'm not sure the answer. Do you have the answer to that?\nJohn Kinzer\nYeah, the mix of the people buying the product is pretty similar. It is Brent, it is more people just buying more of our products, as well as Brent we do have that phenomenon where our smallest customers churn which from a mix standpoint helps that revenue per customer as well.\nBrent Thill\nOkay. And just in terms of your go-to-market this year I know the partner channel has been hugely influential and helping you as say create more shade for the business. When you think of any changes you made in Q1 and the go-to-market, were there any fine tunes or tweaks outside your normal playbook or is the existing playbook that you have been using for the last year?\nBrian Halligan\nYeah. On the margins little tweaks, nothing major or notable on the partner channel, really happy with it, we signed up 180 new partners in Q1. A lot of our partners are getting big. They have 50, 60, 70 account with us and we are really growing well together. So, very, very pleased with the progress we are making on the partner side and we will continue to innovate and continue to tweak it as the time goes on.\nBrent Thill\nOkay. Just really quick Brian I know you love all your products equally, but if you had to pick one or two that were jumping out, you think this could be bigger needle mover for you during the year what would you highlight in terms of that one or two names in the portfolio?\nBrian Halligan\nIn terms of products?\nBrent Thill\nYeah, in terms of the add-ons which ones do you think could be the most meaningful that maybe you haven't seen that are ramping nicely right now?\nBrian Halligan\nSure. So, let's just go to them. The website add-on has been around a while. It\u2019s going well. We love it when customers host their whole website on HubSpot. They are far happier and stickier when that happens it's really great. The reporting add-on for inbound, gone really, really well, the products is getting better receptions has been good.\nThe ads product is still in beta but we just made a huge improvement by including Google Adwords that's going to be really key because you are going to be able to create your ad inside of HubSpot, advertise within HubSpot then track the results and do closed loop ROI reporting on your ads inside of HubSpot so that will be really nice and that's just starting.\nBut the biggest one is likely the ads business \u2013 sorry the sales business, that's going to be a large business for us over time. Still early stage we are running it like a startup and then start up in an economics are looking pretty good and it's growing very fast. So that's the most meaningful one over the next couple of years and that's the one to really keep an eye on.\nBrent Thill\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMatt Coss\nHi. Good afternoon. This is Matt Coss calling in for Mark Murphy. So your new customers that are adopting your tools they're replacing existing tools or in some cases they\u2019ve never even had a solution in the case of a lot of your CRM customers.\nSo how do you ensure they adopt the new processes and workflows and best practices that will ultimately strengthen the products stickiness, so basically how are you driving the change in behavior new customers that will make them successful with inbound marketing? Thanks.\nBrian Halligan\nYeah. Hi, Matt, that's a good question. We try to do as much of it as we can with software and rather than put a lot of humans in there and I kind of think of it as let's say you want to get money out of the bank, 10 years 15 years go. You would walk into the bank and you talk to the teller and you wait in line to get your money out and it was sort of bad for the customer, bad for the bank.\nNow you've go to your ATM. It's over 24 hours a day, it's very good for the bank and it's good for the customer. I like, like in the sales businesses more like an ATM. Very easy to do business with this, much of it is automated and so we take them to a very structured work flow to try to bring them up to speed.\nEach customer that purchases our sales product gets a very small amount of consulting and handholding while we try to get them perfectly set up and on the right path. So it's a very light touch model, it's largely done with software it's a very modern approach and seems to be working.\nPeople who \u2013 we noticed that people who install the CRM and start using it and get multiple users on it, its sticks with them and they really enjoyed the product and they end up buying the sales product from us so, so far so good. Very early though, it's kind of startup within a startup but making very good progress on that front.\nMatt Coss\nGot it. Thank you.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Eric Lemus with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nEric Lemus\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Nice job in the quarter. Question for you John as far as the business mix for prepaid for the annual prepay versus quarterly, where does that sit now and how does that progress over the next couple of quarters or next couple of years?\nBrian Halligan\nYeah. So, on the number of months we are getting up front that's what we look at. We \u2013 it's a combination of monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual. We're still continuing to get about 6 months to 7 months upfront but what's actually happening is we do once again I was talking about from our retention standpoint that we end up having our smallest customers churn out.\nWe also have our monthly customer or our small customers more likely our monthly build and it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to understand that once those people churn out, you actually get a little uplift on the billing side.\nSo it\u2019s not huge, but it is a nice little uplift to cash flow where the base is coming up a little bit which cites for cash flow, helps us to get a little bit more up front, but we always balance that. We don\u2019t want to slowdown velocity from a sales standpoint, but obviously we want to get as much cash up front as we can.\nEric Lemus\nGot it. Thanks for color. And then one last question, as far as ARPU is concerned for new customers, you have a lot more products and more add-ons, how is that ARPU for new customers trending versus the overall company average?\nBrian Halligan\nThe ARPU of the new customers has trended up a little bit. As Brian said, where people are bracing inbound. They are buying more of our products upfront and then ongoing. So that\u2019s been a nice trend for us, and that is helping both the new ARPU, but also ongoing. Those customers are about the same size as overall ARPU, but as they grow over time that has been a nice lift as our revenue per customer trends up.\nEric Lemus\nGot it. Thanks guys.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to HubSpot's CEO and Chairman, Brian Halligan for closing remarks.\nBrian Halligan\nThank you all for joining the call. And mark on your calendars for inbound in November. We look forward to seeing you all live in person. Thank you again. Bye.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\n\n",

These forward-looking statements involve uncertainties and risks that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements.\nFactors that may affect our results are summarized on our quarterly release and described in detail in our SEC filings. Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.\nBefore we begin the call, we wanted to announce that we plan to hold our 2018 Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York on the morning of Thursday, March 8. More information on the meeting, including a link to where you can register for the event is available on our Investor Relations webpage.\nI will now turn the call over to Andy.\nAndy Reinland\nThank you, Jason. Fiscal Q1 was a quarter of disciplined execution. We delivered Q1 \u201818 revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of the ranges we provided in October and executed another quarter of strong gross margin and cash flow. We continue to see strength in our software offerings, particularly deployments in the public cloud and our services business delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth.\nFirst quarter revenue of $523 million, up 1% year-over-year was above the midpoint of our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. Driven by the recent U.S. Tax Reform Legislation, GAAP EPS of $1.41 per share was below our guidance of $1.47 per share to $1.50 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.26 per share was above our guidance of $2.02 per share to $2.05 per share. I will discuss the impact of the tax law changes in more detail later in my comments.\nProduct revenue of $227 million in the first quarter was down 5% year-over-year and accounted for 43% of total revenue. Services revenue of $296 million, grew 7% year-over-year and represented 57% of total revenue.\nOn a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 2% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 7% year-over-year and accounted for 27% of overall revenue. APAC, which accounted for 14% of the total, decreased 5% year-over-year and Japan at 4% of total revenue decreased 12% from a year ago.\nSales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 20% and government sales were 16%, including 8% from U.S. Federal. In Q1, we had five greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15% of total revenue, Tech Data accounted for 12%, Arrow and Cynics each accounted for 11%, and Westcon accounted for 10% of revenue.\nMoving on to our operating results, GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 83.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.7%. GAAP operating expenses of $294 million were within our $288 million to $298 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $258 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 27.1% and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.5%.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.6%. GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were impacted by the recently-enacted Tax Reform Legislation.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate of 38.7% was primarily impacted by two large non-recurring items; an estimated $7 million tax related to deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign tax earnings, and a $11.6 million impact from the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets due to the change in the U.S. tax rate. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 24.6% reflects the benefits from the reduction of the U.S. tax rate.\nTurning to the balance sheet, in Q1 we generated $190 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.35 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 50 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.5 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $29 million. Deferred revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $991 million.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately 4,375 employees, up slightly from the prior quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.24 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $120.73 per share for a total of $150 million.\nMoving to our guidance for fiscal Q2, we continue to see enterprises and service providers adopt our software and security offerings as core components of the next-generation application architectures.\nWhile this trend has lengthened sales cycles for hardware-based solutions with some organization in the middle of this transition, it is driving substantial growth opportunity in both private and public cloud deployments, providing a solid foundation for improving product revenue as we progress through the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond.\nWith this in mind for the second quarter of fiscal year \u201818, we are targeting revenue in a range of $525 million to $535 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%.\nWe estimate GAAP operating expenses of $296 million to $306 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 26% for the second quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 25%.\nWe anticipate tax rates to remain at or around these levels for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and will continue to update on a quarterly basis and while we are not yet providing tax rate guidance for fiscal year \u201819, it is worth noting that we would expect another small step down in both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in fiscal year \u201819 and beyond, reflecting full calendar year impact from the new tax legislation.\nOur Q2 GAAP earnings target is $1.66 per share to $1.69 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.24 per share to $2.27 per share. As a reminder, we will be hosting our Investor and Analyst Meeting in New York on March 8.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Fran\u00e7ois.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nThank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter, we saw continued momentum with our virtual additions and another strong quarter from our services business. We are increasingly seeing security lead the conversation in new opportunities with customers and our cloud activity is growing as more customers look to our solutions for help in deploying applications across multi-cloud environments.\nEarlier this month, we released our annual State of Application Delivery report. With over 3000 respondents, the report provides a comprehensive view into the application trends impacting enterprises, service providers and government organizations across the globe. The results show digital transformation is at the forefront of our customers\u2019 minds as they look to optimize their IT infrastructure and evolve how they develop and deliver applications.\nMulti-cloud architectures are taking on growing relevance as most organizations pursue a best-of-breed strategy for each application deployment. Nearly nine in 10 respondents reported using multiple clouds with over half saying cloud decisions are made on a per application basis.\nOur customers are increasingly looking to automation and orchestration to realize leaner IT with the goal of reducing OpEx and better scaling applications to meet user demand. Trends around supporting multi-cloud deployments and the growing importance of automation align with areas where we have increased our development investment over the past year.\nDuring the first quarter, we introduced per application VE offerings supporting traffic management and web application firewall services, and we made platform enhancements that reduced the boot time and footprint of our software by 50% for public cloud deployments.\nThese offerings are building blocks for enhanced central management and automation capabilities we will introduce later this year that support elastic provisioning of VE capacity. Executing in these areas will extend the number of applications we can address, whether these applications reside on-prem or in the cloud.\nTaking a closer look at first quarter results, revenue was above the midpoint of our guided range with strength in our software offerings. We saw a rebound in our EMEA theater as initiatives we undertook in 2017 to improve execution in this region are paying dividends. We continued to deliver strong profitability and cash generation even as we accelerate our development and go-to-market investment in software, public cloud and security.\nWe are not satisfied with the current level of product revenue growth, but we are encouraged by improvements in execution and the continued strength in the fastest growing areas of the business.\nAnd while we have seen instances of longer sign-off periods for hardware-related sales within some organizations, our overall appliance revenue was in line with our expectations entering the first quarter. We continue to expect the iSeries platform will be a growing part of our appliance mix in the coming quarters.\nWe believe these product family offers compelling performance and customization advantages versus competing offerings, and will enable us to take market share in the appliance segment as we progress through fiscal 2018.\niSeries provides advantages and key use cases for customers including efficiently managing encrypted traffic and scaling to support high transactional applications such as IoT. We have several significant customer wins in the quarter driven by the SSL capabilities enabled by iSeries.\nThese include seven figure deals with the government organization and a large financial services organization where our ability to efficiently inspect and re-encrypt SSL traffic was a clear differentiator overcome competing offerings.\nA large pan-European managed service provider will utilize our hardware, security and IoT protocol capabilities to support the need for securely scaling applications to better manage customer premise equipment and data.\nThese include inspecting SSL traffic, providing DDoS protection, load balancing and authentication of IoT traffic. F5\u2019s ability to innovate around scaling to support bi-directional communication in an IoT environment was a key contributor to this win.\nDuring the first quarter, our VE sales grew over 25% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Driving this growth was increased activity within the public cloud from both bring your own license and utility offerings.\nWe are present within all three major public clouds in providing advanced application services and security across multi-cloud deployments is becoming a priority to customers as they move forward with their digital transformation efforts.\nWe accelerate growth within the public cloud. We continue to deepen our partner relationships. In December, we earned Amazon Web Services networking competency designation by showcasing our ability to ensure performance, availability and security for business critical applications hosted within AWS. This follows our security competency recognition by AWS in October.\nWe joined a select group of partners to meet the qualifications set forth by AWS for technical proficiency and customer success in multiple competencies. As we look to extend our solutions to a broader set of our customer\u2019s applications, we are focused on creating more flexibility in deployment and consumption.\nOver the past six months, we launched our subscription offerings on large scale and launched enterprise license agreements. Initial customer response for these consumption models has been very positive, with a building pipeline, including net new opportunities across on-prem and cloud environments.\nOur enterprise security momentum remains strong in the first quarter driven by our WAF and identity access offerings. We believe we are uniquely positioned to address our customer\u2019s growing needs around Application Security.\nOur F5 core is a non-matched level of application fluency with large complex applications. Our security capabilities are increasingly leading the way in opening new opportunities across our customer base.\nWe continue to expand our application security portfolio across private and public cloud environments. Building on our market leading position in WAF, we are partnering with AWS to make our WAF security rules available to our common customers through the AWS marketplace.\nToday, we announced several new additions to the senior management team. We are excited to welcome Ana, Kara, Ram and Tom to the F5 team. These additions put into action the plans from the business review process we undertook last year and discussed on our Q4 earnings call.\nFocus on clearly aligning our product roadmap with customer needs through ADC and security business leadership is a key priority that Kara and Ram will drive. Tom will be responsible for driving the business long-term strategy, as well as overseeing corporate development and our incubation areas, which we will discuss in more detail in March.\nWe are pleased with our execution in the first quarter and we are well-positioned to evolve with our customers as they make their digital transformations. To better reach the next tier of applications in the enterprise, we are reducing frictions associated with purchasing, deploying and managing our solutions.\nWe are excited by our growing traction within the public cloud and the role our application security solutions are playing across our customer base. Driving improved product revenue growth remains our top priority and we expect to show progress on this front as we move through fiscal 2018.\nIn closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the first quarter.\nWith that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.\nPaul Silverstein\nThanks. First one, Andy, from a, I guess, two perspectives, one from a macro in the health and in-demand perspective where it looks like the objective numbers relative to U.S. growth, EU growth, et cetera, have been trending up and [indiscernible] right now to be quite favorable.\nAndy Reinland\nYeah.\nPaul Silverstein\nAnd so there\u2019s a favorable economic backdrop. And then, in terms of the company specific issues or product market specific issues, especially relative to the product refresh from a year ago that hadn\u2019t transpired and we still don\u2019t see the product revenue growth picking up, the question being, can you give us more insight, more detail on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of customer behavior, their willingness to spend, as well as your particular issues in the ADC market?\nAndy Reinland\nThank you, Paul. So, I\u2019ll start, on your first question as it relates to Europe. I think you heard that we had some challenges in Europe in 2017, which we felt were linked both to some macro issues around the environment, Brexit, some uncertainty around regulation, and we also felt that some of it had to do with our own organization and some execution challenges we were having.\nOver the last, I\u2019d say, two quarters, we felt the number of these have gotten -- have moved in the right direction, so a lot of the macro uncertainties in Europe I think are resolved. There\u2019s more clarity around Brexit, generally the European economies in Continental Europe are doing much better.\nAnd so we feel that the macro environment is generally better, and we\u2019ve made some changes in our own formation in Europe. We\u2019ve made some leadership changes. We\u2019ve also realigned our teams towards what we perceive to be the best opportunities for growth. And as a result, we\u2019re doing better. We are really encouraged by the results we saw in Europe this quarter. We\u2019re cautious because we had several quarters of challenges there, but we\u2019re also optimistic about what we\u2019re seeing with our pipeline generally in Europe and our execution.\nYour second question was on product revenue growth; and generally, the customer behaviors that we\u2019re seeing. There hasn\u2019t been much change on that front since last quarter that -- we\u2019re seeing two things specifically on the iSeries refresh.\nNumber one, the adoption of the product continues to be very strong. It is a very high-quality product. Our customers really see actually new use cases for the product and really love the performance of the product, so we\u2019re continuing to see strong adoption within our customer base for the platform.\nOn the other hand, we\u2019re also continuing to see some delays in decision-making related to hardware, in part because of the complexity of the architectures that our customers are dealing with now.\nAs they move applications across multiple clouds, some in hybrid cloud, some in private cloud, some in public cloud, the variables in the decision-making process are just more complex and we\u2019re seeing elongated cycles of decision-making and that\u2019s one of the reasons. I think the key reason, why we don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the growth acceleration that we would have expected at this point in past cycles.\nPaul Silverstein\nAnd Fran\u00e7ois, just a quick clarification, if I may, on your commentary about seeing strength in public cloud with respect to enterprises adopting multi-cloud architecture, I know you don\u2019t quantify it, but I am asking you if you would be willing to quantify it for the benefit of all of us, I think it\u2019s awfully important?\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nYeah. So we don\u2019t quantify it, Paul. I think we\u2019ve said it is growing fast. These numbers are still small relative to our overall revenues. They\u2019re growing very fast, and we\u2019ve actually exceeded our own expectations again this quarter in terms of the growth we\u2019re seeing in our solutions in the public cloud. We\u2019ll probably say more about -- overall our public cloud strategy, the solutions we have in there, and the traction we\u2019re seeing in the public cloud at our Analyst Meeting in March, Paul.\nPaul Silverstein\nAnd you don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any cannibalization or meaningful cannibalization?\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nActually I do think so, you have to part that into two domains. There are some applications that are -- that we support that are moving to the public cloud and generally we have a very strong attach rate to these applications. But I think in these use cases, it is substitutive to something we would have done on-prem in the past, so that -- there\u2019s definitely an element of cannibalization or if you will, just a change in deployment model of on-prem versus public cloud.\nBut we\u2019re also seeing net new use cases, so we do acquire and we did again this quarter acquired a number of net new logos, so these are companies that have never bought from F5 before and bought for the first time in our public cloud partners AWS, Azure, or Google.\nAnd we\u2019re also seeing some types of deployments that we would have not had access to before. So a number of our deployments in the public cloud are utility based. This is where customers are essentially renting F5 Virtual Editions for hours, and we\u2019re already billing several millions of hours of Virtual Edition in public cloud today, and that\u2019s net new incremental for us. That\u2019s not opportunities we would have had access to before.\nPaul Silverstein\nI appreciate. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nThank you, Paul.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Tim Long of BMO. Your line is open.\nTim Long\nThank you. Just two for me as well, if you talk about, a little bit about the service line, it was very strong again, a little stronger than expected here, was there any kind of one timers or anything abnormal with seeing the growth reaccelerate there? And then on the telco vertical, a little bit less than normal seasonal in Q4. Could you point a little bit to what might have held that business back and talk a little bit about the outlook for the telco piece looking out the next few quarters? Thank you.\nAndy Reinland\nYeah. Tim, so I\u2019ll start with the service line and I think a couple of things is when we tend to see seasonally just based on calendar end contracts align and things like that and that helps drive business. We also had a program in place for really focusing on going after business in Europe that we felt we weren\u2019t focused on enough and actually had a pretty effective quarter in recapturing a lot of maintenance contracts that for lack of a better description slipped through the cracks. So those one-time things helped drive the strength that we saw. So we\u2019ll see that pullback a little bit in Q2 along with normal seasonality but that\u2019s built into the guidance.\nJohn DiLullo\nYeah. This is John DiLullo. Also I can answer the question about the carriers. We saw as per normal a little bit of lumpiness last quarter and it didn\u2019t come exactly where we\u2019d expected. But aren\u2019t reading anything long-term into that and continue to see a lot of activity in both the software and the hardware environments in that vertical.\nTim Long\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nMark Kelleher\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back to the product revenue. I want to probably stick on that a little bit here. The last three quarters we\u2019ve seen continued deceleration and in this quarter despite the iSeries kicking into its cycle and strong Europe, we\u2019re seeing that deceleration again. So what are the headwinds that you\u2019ve been facing that are -- that you see going away that will allow that topline to grow into next year -- this year?\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nThank you, Mark. So I think actually from an iSeries refresh perspective, we don\u2019t see a change. We think the demand for the product is very healthy. As I\u2019ve said we\u2019re seeing new use cases for the product in IoT, high transactional applications, et cetera, and we think that\u2019s going to continue for the longer term.\nThere are though some product drivers of product revenue growth that we think are kicking in and probably will accelerate in the second half of the year. Virtual editions will continue to grow. We expect our public cloud revenues to continue to grow.\nWe continue to see strong demand for our security solutions, in particular driven by WAF and the increasing trend towards to encryption of all traffic that we deal with. And our SSL capabilities position very well -- position us very well to deal with that. So security, Virtual Editions and public cloud, I think will continue to be a driver in the second half of the year.\nAnd then there\u2019s some changes we\u2019ve made, we\u2019ve talked about our realignment during our earnings call three months ago. There\u2019s some changes we\u2019ve made structurally in our sales channels, go-to-market and some consumption models that we have started offering that we expect to have also an impact going into the rest of FY18. So when you factor all of that, I think we feel pretty good about what we\u2019ve said last quarter, which is continued improvement in product revenue performance throughout the year.\nMark Kelleher\nOkay. Just as a quick follow up, the -- Europe was very strong but the U.S., the Americas was kind of weak, was there anything particular going on in the U.S.?\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nNo. Nothing -- I would say nothing in particular. I think the demand in service providers in the U.S. was, it\u2019s typically lumpy but it was weak this quarter. So you factor all that in, it made up for I\u2019d say a decent performance in North America but not particularly strong. I\u2019d say North America enterprise was stronger than North America service provider.\nMark Kelleher\nOkay. Great. Thanks.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nThank you, Mark.\nOperator\nThe next -- I am sorry, the next question is from James Fish of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.\nJames Fish\nHi guys. Thanks for the question here. Not to keep beating a dead horse but with product down 5% and it looks like actually on a billings basis you guys were down as well for the first time in a little while. At what point do you guys think that as we progress through the year that we could see stability in the product line, if at all and potentially what concerns you on sort of services billings potentially being down then on a year-to-year basis?\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nSo I\u2019ll take your question on the product and Andy will touch on the services, James. So you know, on the product first, this was an execution quarter for us. The product revenue came roughly in line with where we expected it to be.\nAs you know, we don\u2019t guide product revenue specifically for the other quarters, but the drivers that I\u2019ve just gone through around software, security and cloud, as well as the initiatives we undertook both on the product and the sale side give us good visibility into where we think we\u2019re going to be going into FY18.\nAnd we expect our product revenue performance to improve sequentially from what we had in Q1 throughout the rest of FY18. I think that\u2019s what we said three months ago and we still feel pretty good about that.\nAndy Reinland\nYeah. And then on the services business, yeah, that -- because most of our services business and revenue is driven by maintenance and renewals, and given where our product revenue has been over the last year and a half, many times we talked about we\u2019re going to see that pull down our services billings overtime, and therefore, the revenue. We think returning to product revenue growth will then pull that back up.\nSo year-over-year we are seeing it pull down a little bit on a percentage basis, it was expected, it\u2019s directly correlated to our products business. That\u2019s just how it is and as Fran\u00e7ois said, as we expect to see that improve as we execute through the year, we\u2019d expect that to see services pull from that as we return to product revenue growth.\nJames Fish\nGot it. And then just a quick clarification, I am not sure if I\u2019ve missed it, but did you guys mention what the average deal size was this quarter, I think last quarter it was about $122,000.\nAndy Reinland\nYeah.\nJames Fish\nAnd then, Andy, any color as to any change in the renewal rates?\nAndy Reinland\nYes. So to the average deal size, this quarter it was about $113,000, so still within that kind of band that we see. We think a little bit of that\u2019s seasonality, if you look a year ago Q1, it was $110,000. We\u2019re not seeing any dynamic in the deals combined with that that would lead us to any other conclusion that we\u2019re still in that band and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s pulling up or down deals. And as far as renewal rates, we saw that tick up because of the cleanup in EMEA, but overall I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty normal.\nJames Fish\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura | Instinet. Your line is open.\nJeff Kvaal\nThanks very much. I\u2019d like to change the subject a little bit and get to tax. Part of that, Andy, is for you in terms of what can you tell us about how we should be thinking about the benefits to your free cash flow from the tax reform? And then, Fran\u00e7ois, for you to some extent this gives you an even more powerful balance sheet to work with, what are the triggers that you might consider to deploy that? Thank you.\nAndy Reinland\nYeah. So what we expect is we will see -- as we see the benefit of that through the year, the majority of it we think is going to fall through and now it\u2019s still early days. We\u2019re evaluating it against our strategy. But and we\u2019ll talk more about this at AM. But there\u2019s a reality to how we view our business and where -- how we value our business model, and we\u2019re going to take all of that into consideration, and we think by March 8 we\u2019ll be able to talk in more detail about what we\u2019re going to do with that free cash flow. But again, as I started out, we\u2019ll see a lot of that flow through, but reluctant to give anything more specific than that right now.\nJeff Kvaal\nI can tell. Yeah.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nAnd Jeff, on your -- to the second part of your question, so we will talk more about capital allocation at our Analyst Meeting in March, but I would say this, generally, access to capital has not impacted our capital allocation strategies historically and I don\u2019t expect this tax rate to fundamentally impact our capital allocation strategy.\nAnd it has been and our view will continue to be that we want to return a fair amount of capital to shareholders and that\u2019s been our practice. I think we have one of the strongest buybacks in the industry. But we\u2019ve also said that when we have opportunities for M&A, we will be disciplined about these opportunities, but if we see opportunities to accelerate things that are strategic to us, we will do that. And that philosophy is not fundamentally changed by the benefit we\u2019re getting from the change in Tax Legislation.\nJeff Kvaal\nOkay. Thank you both.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nThank you, Jeff.\nOperator\nThe next questioner is from Alex Henderson of Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson\nThanks. Two quick questions, one, just looking at the March quarter guide on the revenues, is it reasonable to think that the rate of decline in products has hit the trough in the December quarter is down 5% or is it possible that we could see a similar decline or more in the March quarter given it\u2019s against a tougher comp?\nAnd then the second question I had was really on the security side. I was wondering if you could give us some sense of, is WAF the vast majority of what you\u2019re selling in security and if so, it looks like that\u2019s becoming more and more of a feature on most of the security platforms that are out there. Has competition increased and made it more difficult in that space as a result of that becoming a more widely distributed feature on more and more platforms? Thank you.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nThank you, Alex. I\u2019ll take the first one. John will take security. So, yes, I mean, if you look at our guidance for the March quarter and you -- I think you do a good analysis on the midpoint of the guide, et cetera.\nYes, it would imply that we have -- that the product revenue performance in Q2 will be better than what it was in Q1. And in fact, generally, when we look at our -- at the progress we have, the pipeline we see in our product revenue and the execution we see, we actually do feel we are turning the corner on product revenue growth in Q2, and frankly, we would be disappointed if we did not return to product revenue growth in the second half of \u201818.\nAlex Henderson\nHow much is your comps there?\nJohn DiLullo\nAnswering -- Alex, answering your question on WAF. So this is a really a great market for us and as you know, we have a leading product there. We have also a very differentiated product especially in our installed base, which is still a very large market for us to go after.\nAnd then, as it relates to greenfield opportunities with competition, I think we have some competitive differentiators, but we also have a lot of mobility and our product works in a multi-cloud environment and all the public clouds as well, and that\u2019s one of the fastest areas of growth for us, people trying to standardize their security posture across the multi-cloud environment. So it\u2019s mostly been a positive for us.\nAlex Henderson\nSo you haven\u2019t seen any erosion in that market or any increased pressures in it as a result of additional competition?\nJohn DiLullo\nNo. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a greatly increased demand and some of our competitors are raising awareness and that\u2019s generally been a positive.\nAlex Henderson\nThanks for the explanation.\nOperator\nThe next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette\nHi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions for me, first, just wondering with the kind of bringing some of the customers through service and maintenance contracts that expired back into the fold, if you will on those. I am wondering if we should think about that potentially hurting the chances that they will upgrade to the newest versions of product or does that help, just trying to think about like how that may impact it?\nAnd I guess as part of the improvement in Europe, any evidence from your perspective that the weakening dollar may have helped a little bit either in terms of accelerating close times or expanding product or deal size, excuse me?\nAnd then, I guess my last question is, Fran\u00e7ois for -- with the appointing of Ram to be Director of Security, can you talk a little bit about how you would like to have kind of what his to do list is and what impact you\u2019d like to see him have on security and tied to the existing F5 product portfolio, and over what timeframe we should expect that? Thanks a lot.\nJohn DiLullo\nThank you, James. That\u2019s a lot in there. Which is the first question again?\nAndy Reinland\nWell, I\u2019ll start with the first one on the service and maintenance. Do we think that hinders customers upgrading and John can add on to this if he has additional commentary from his perspective, but really this was a program put in place, because we think we lost a little focus there. This wasn\u2019t anything more than smaller deals were just not getting addressed. We regrouped the team and where they thought they were lost we said they\u2019re not lost, go after them, and get renewals.\nAnd when we renew, we can capture the revenue for the period of time that\u2019s gone by between the expiration of the contract and the renewal and we think that was the main driver there, not anything that you could correlate that that\u2019s directionally how they might be thinking about upgrading their equipment.\nJohn DiLullo\nBut I would add to that that it\u2019s very powerful from a sales go-to-market perspective to continue to have that commercial relationship with those customers. It doesn\u2019t inhibit future sales. In fact, it gives us lots of visibility in the challenges our customers are having and really sets up the next generation sales, so it\u2019s hugely positive to have a high renewal rate for us.\nAndy Reinland\nYeah. And then on the foreign currency, could that be helping us, I mean, clearly because we bill internationally primarily in U.S. dollars, it makes our equipment more affordable. Anecdotally, I am not hearing anything that would say that\u2019s driving business. I would contend this really is more about projects that were delayed as they worked their way through everything going on from Brexit to GDPR and it\u2019s getting to the point where it\u2019s freeing up again. So I wouldn\u2019t correlate those two things personally.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nAnd then to the second part of your question, James, so Ram and his priorities. Firstly, on his background, RAM has a long experience in the security industry, both with more traditional security companies and more sort of next-generation cloud-oriented security companies.\nAnd so he has a very broad perspective of the industry and that is going to be very valuable for us, because in security we have no shortage of opportunities, and a key part of the mission for Ram is to really prioritize the opportunities that we go after.\nOne of the immediate elements of what Ram is working on is we have been quite successful selling security attached to our ADC and we see opportunity more and more, and demand from our customers to take on some of our standalone security offerings that would appeal more to a sec ops buyer. And so Ram\u2019s looking at what\u2019s the best way to capture that opportunity and which offerings should be first versus offerings that would follow on later, and that\u2019s an immediate priority.\nAnd then more broadly, in the space of application security, we\u2019re seeing a lot of new complexities emerge. Those were validated again by the research we did in our State of Application Delivery report, where we\u2019re seeing that, as people adopt more and more multi-cloud environments, their confidence in security solutions is actually decreasing.\nAnd really, there\u2019s an opportunity to emerge as a partner to solve these new complexities. Where we start in this journey to multi-cloud application security, again is a set of priorities and investments that RAM is going to define for us.\nJames Faucette\nThat\u2019s great. Thank you so much.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nThank you, James.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Michael Genovese of MKM Partners. Your line is open.\nMichael Genovese\nThanks a lot. Can you help us quantify some of these things in your security, for instance, security appliance attach rates? Do you have any kind of metric we can track there and even more importantly, standalone security sales as a percentage of revenue, and are we targeting that to grow over time, what can you share with us there? Thanks.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nHi, Mike. And so the last question is easy. Yes, we are targeting standalone security offerings to grow over time. To the first part, no we don\u2019t break that out. I can tell you an important portion of our security or even of our ADC business is driven by security and I would say qualitatively that that portion of the business that\u2019s driven by security is growing every quarter.\nThe other data point I\u2019d give you is that, as our public cloud business grows, the security attach rate in the public cloud is about double what it is on-prem and that\u2019s because of the complexities of securing applications in the public cloud. So that\u2019s as far as I\u2019ll go as far as quantifying our security business, generally the trends are up and more important for us.\nMichael Genovese\nOkay. That\u2019s fair. Thanks, Fran\u00e7ois. And then you just hired a new Strategy Corporate Development Manager and so my question is how do you think he and his team can help you drive the topline growth in the company and do you think security will kind of be over weighted portion of that?\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nYes, Mike. So there are multiple responsibilities for Tom Fountain who\u2019s joined us last week as our Chief Strategy Officer. One is we have initiated a number of incubation initiatives where we\u2019re looking at new developments that would have potentially long-term growth opportunities for F5 and these are under Tom in part, because Tom has also a background in venture capital and can help us provide the right oversight for this part of the business.\nTom also owns our Business Development Group and our relationships with a number of companies with whom we have partnerships in the IT space. And these partnerships are actually quite important for the topline, because we co-market, we co-sale, we do certifications, we are integrated in their environments, whether it be SDN environments or next-generation IT architectures. And so those partnerships are key to short-term revenues and Tom\u2019s going to help drive that with the Business Development Group.\nThen the last portion of Tom\u2019s responsibilities is in fact corporate development and in that Tom has the experience to help us with the build versus buy decisions that we think we will be making as we assess opportunities in security and elsewhere around developing our portfolio.\nMichael Genovese\nOkay. Thank you, Fran\u00e7ois.\nJason Willey\nOperator, I think, we\u2019ll take one more question.\nOperator\nCertainly. The next question is from Jayson Noland of Baird. Your line is open.\nJayson Noland\nOkay. Great. Thank you. Fran\u00e7ois, I wanted to ask about your comment on architectural change causing decision-making delays. Public cloud isn\u2019t new and SaaS isn\u2019t new, so maybe there\u2019s an inflection point that\u2019s happened of late, but could you talk to that statement a little more?\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nYes. So what we\u2019ve seen is a number of customers are when they\u2019re making decisions and this comment was specific to the refresh cycle on iSeries, and specifically, on hardware purchases, where we\u2019re seeing a number of customers before making these decisions as part of the decision-making cycle undertake a review of what assets do they want to have where.\nYou will see that one thing that has changed year-on-year and we\u2019ve reported on that in this State of Application Delivery report, is that customers are embracing multi-cloud and as part of that they\u2019re having a sort of best cloud for the app strategy. So they\u2019re making decisions on where an app is going to reside on a per app basis in cloud versus non-cloud.\nAnd as they go and make these decisions and have to make significant commitment on infrastructure assets, that decision-making cycle is elongated. Cloud is not new. You\u2019re correct about that. But I think multi-cloud and per app decision-making around multi-cloud is a trend that we are seeing becoming reality.\nFor us, frankly, while this has given I would say short term headwinds specifically on hardware and as we said, I think, last quarter, we didn\u2019t see on hardware the uptick that we would have seen at this part of the cycle.\nOverall, we think over the long run it bodes very well for us, because we feel that we\u2019re probably uniquely positioned to serve these needs across multi-cloud environments with our hardware, on-premises, our software on-premise and increasingly our software in the public cloud with multiple consumption models across all these environments. There aren\u2019t -- there isn\u2019t any other company that really has this breadth of offerings for supporting these multi-cloud strategies.\nJayson Noland\nOkay. And then to finish things up you\u2019ve called your growth areas cloud, security and then Virtual Editions. Is -- which of those is receiving the most investment or which offer has the most opportunity across those three?\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nSo that\u2019s a good question. So there are different stages of growth. I would say our Virtual Edition software is already a meaningful business for F5 and we continue to shift more investments in that direction.\nSecurity also I think is at scale for us at F5. Public cloud is more nascent. So in terms of growth in investment, public cloud probably has the highest growth of investments in these areas, but the two other areas are if you will larger to-date and with increasing investments year-on-year.\nJayson Noland\nOkay. Thanks a lot, Fran\u00e7ois.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nThank you.\nAndy Reinland\nThank you everyone for participating today. We hope that we see many of you in New York in March. Good afternoon.\nFran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou\nThank you.\nOperator\nThat concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n\n",

Gallagher & Company's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nSome of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that will be discussed on this call and which are also described in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.\nPatrick Gallagher\nThank you, Christine. Good morning, everyone and thank you very much for joining us this morning. This morning I'm joined as normal with by Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions.\nI\u2019ll make some comments on the quarter, add some perspective to our press release, discuss our mergers and acquisitions, discuss the rate environment, and give my thoughts on how I feel about future, then I will turn it over to Doug to make some comments and we\u2019ll go to questions and answers. \nI just have to tell you, I could not be more pleased with our second quarter that I am, this is unbelievable. What our team accomplished is just outstanding. On April 1, we announced our acquisition of Oval in the United Kingdom. \nIn April, we entered into an agreement to acquire Crombie Lockwood in Australia, New Zealand and we closed it June. We issued a secondary offering and raised just short of $1 billion in April and we did a $700 million debt offering in June and with all that going on, we completed 17 total mergers including the ones I just mentioned for almost $500 million in annualized revenue. We grew our adjusted brokerage revenue 34%, we grew adjusted brokerage EBITDAC at 43%, expanded our brokerage margin of 190 basis points through our Risk Management revenues of 8% and grew Risk Management EBITDAC 9%. \nOur organic growth in the quarter all in our operating units was 4.4%. Brokerage base commissions and fees were up 3.1%. Our brokerage supplemental commissions were up organically 9.1%. Our brokerage contingence commissions organically were up 9.7% and our Risk Management organic growth was 7.6%. By all measures, a terrific quarter. I just could not be prouder of our team. \nLet me discuss mergers and acquisitions. 17 mergers completed in the quarter is incredible work by our team. Remember, in order to get 17 mergers done in a quarter, we have to show these successful entrepreneurs why they\u2019ll be more successful after the deal is done with Gallagher than either going it alone or with another strategic partner. \nAs competition for these firms and they chose Gallagher. I say this every quarter, welcome to our new partners and thank you for choosing Arthur J Gallagher & Company, welcome to our growing Gallagher family. \nWe\u2019ve been a very active acquirer for 28 years. We\u2019ve built our company by finding compatible firms and proving that one plus one can equal three, four, or even five. What we have accomplished in the last couple of years has truly transformed our company. Consider this, we bought Heath to get it started in the UK retail. This led to Giles, Oval and other bolt-on acquisitions making us one of the top brokerage firms with over 70 offices throughout the UK. \nWe became the largest broker in New Zealand. We joined the top five in Australia. We joined the top five in Canada. We continued our merger and acquisition strategy in the US maintaining our spot at number three. And let me say this about the firms that we have acquired. \nThere are middle-market, niche focused, producer-centric insurance brokerages right in our sweet spot. And I\u2019ll tell you, once they join our company, they are like kids in a candy store when they get access to the resources and capabilities that Gallagher brings to them. \nWe have built a truly global platform with all of our people committed to responding to our clients and prospects needs utilizing our top talent wherever it resides around the world without any barriers. \nOur integration work streams are all on track, we are winning new accounts, serving our existing client base and we continue building out our world-class company. And the thing that\u2019s incredible is that our pipeline for acquisitions remains very, very strong. \nLet me move to the property casualty rate environment. We did a mid-year survey of our property casualty renewals and you\u2019ll read in that release that it shows about a third are getting increases about a third are flat in terms of rates and about a third are getting decreases. So let me peel that back a bit. \nFirst recognize it\u2019s really tail two markets, property and casualty. So I\u2019ll talk about property first. 20% of our clients in the property arena are renewing up. But these are single-digit type increases. 25% are seeing no change in rate, 40% are renewing down, but single-digit type decreases and that about 20% are renewing down with decreases greater than 10%. And frankly this is not unreasonable given the fact that we\u2019ve had no real major catastrophes in the last few years. \nAs for domestic casualty lines, we are seeing what I consider to be rational account and coverage underwriting, 40% of those clients are renewing up, but these are single-digit type increases. 30% are showing no change in rate, 30% are renewing down, but again, single-digit type increases and very, very few casualty renewals are getting decreases greater than 10%. \nBeneath that, we are seeing workers comp, commercial auto, and professional lines more moving on the upside, general liability an umbrella of more flattish to slightly down. Internationally, as for the UK, we are seeing a similar property rate pressures in the US and casualty lines are flat to slightly down. \nHowever it\u2019s important to note that there really wasn\u2019t much of a firming market over the last several years in the UK, so we believe underwriters are beginning to take on a more disciplined underwriting approach and are asking for some inflation level rate increases. In Canada, a similar story, the property rates are not as challenged as the US because of a couple of large weather events in the last year. \nIn Australia and New Zealand, property is up single-digits, casualty is flat slightly down and carriers are not really showing any inclination for price increases. Remember this is important. \nOver the last three to four years, our results have been influenced by rate and exposure growth by less than 1%. Our professionals help our clients mitigate costs and they are very, very good at it. We do not need rate increases to grow this company. \nGive us a flat rate environment and AJG will sell a lot more business than we lose. We are a sales machine. Everyone at Gallagher understands, nothing happens till somebody rings the cash register. I believe today\u2019s environment shows continuing discipline on the part of our insurance carriers. \nAll of our major trading partners have been telling us for years they want to account by account underwrite. In other words what they are saying is, if the account deserves a rate cut, give it to them. But if it needs an increase, get it. And we are seeing that discipline continue in the market. I do not feel any lessening of that discipline. I realize there is rate pressure on lines that have produced significant returns to carriers and frankly that\u2019s only fair to our clients.\nSo, I believe this is anything but a soft market. In fact, it\u2019s a great environment for us to grow the business going forward. Let me talk a little bit about our benefits business. Our employee benefit brokerage business continues to pose some of our best organic growth and margins and also has a robust pipeline for acquisitions. And we are right in the middle of one of the most complex and constantly changing challenges basing American businesses which is the new Healthcare Act. \nThis presents us with new opportunities to demonstrate our capabilities to existing clients and prospects. It\u2019s also important to note that medical insurance is just one portion of what we provide to our customers. We offer solutions to the full spectrum of problems around controlling benefits cost, retaining expedite and productive workforce and offering a range of retirement alternatives. \nThis is \u2013 it\u2019s just a terrific business for us. Let me move to our property casualty wholesale operation which we brand as Risk Placement Services, as a domestic wholesaler RPS has impacted significantly in the quarter by the rate environment. However, we continue to grow our business nicely and the programs in the MGA arena. Our underwriting expertise continues to deliver solid revenue growth and contingent increases. \nAnd finally, I want to talk about our Risk Management business which is Gallagher Bassett. We see excellent growth opportunities around the globe. In the US, we continue to enhance our base workers compensation product with unmatched loss control analytics. \nIn the UK, we have tailored our systems and processes allowing us to move from a strong position with governmental customers to commercial customers and in Australia our development of new IT solutions has positioned us to increase our market share with governmental work care covered programs. \nSo, by and large, a terrific quarter. Operations are getting stronger every quarter and I want to talk just a little bit about the future. I think that we are positioned for a terrific close to 2015 barring any change in the economic environment or the rate environment. We should have a solid end of this year and I think we are well set up for 2015. Doug? \nDouglas Howell\nThanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. It's really nice to report a solid quarter and a solid first half for that matter. We'll start on the first page with the Brokerage segment. Our top-line $0.66 per share was aided nicely by the addition of Crombie/OAMPS which we closed on June 16. You read at the top of Page 4 that it added about $0.06 to EPS and now that they earn about 60% of their second quarter earnings in the latter half of June. \nSo that was great work by the team to get closed fast enough to nearly overcome the seven-tenth of dilution that arose in the 60 days between the secondary stock offering in April and the close on June 16. That\u2019s really good work to the team. \nMoving down, you\u2019ll see the integration line which is in line with our forecast, and you heard Pat say that our efforts are going very well. \nStaying with brokerage, but turning to Page 2, to the organic revenue table at the bottom. First, while we continue to believe that transparency into the components of brokerage revenues that\u2019s base supplemental and contingent is that we believe that\u2019s important and useful, please remember that our mission is to work hard on growing all three. \nWe encourage our team to get appropriate compensation for our services and not to worry at all about where it gets classified on our financial statement. Second, underneath the organic numbers, our global retail operations grew nearly 4%, yet our global wholesale operations were about flat. Within retail benefits were a touch better than the P&C business and within wholesale, those operations in particular felt pressure from the property market as Pat said. \nProperty renewals are seasonally skewed somewhat to the second quarter, so we don\u2019t see much \u2013 such a level of headwinds coming into the third and fourth quarter related to property. Third, let me add a bit more to Pat\u2019s statement that historically, the firming rate environment wasn\u2019t contributing much organic, basically less than 1% of our organic growth. \nYou\u2019ll read on the first page of their earnings release that the property rates negatively impacted commissions, but casually rates had a positive impact. Numerically, property pulled down our overall organic by about 80 to 90 basis points and casualty helped our organic by about 20 to 40 basis points. \nSo you can see the headwind there on the property side. \nLet\u2019s move to the brokerage comp operating and adjusted EBITDAC margin tables on Page 3. You\u2019ll see that we have added in the footnote to each table the impact of the four larger mergers we completed since last year second quarter. \nThe punch line is that those four deals in aggregate bolstered our margins by about a 140 basis points and we got another 50 basis points of margin expansion from the balance of our operation. We think that\u2019s terrific in this environment. \nNow, looking over the next couple of quarters, please note that the four larger deals and now with the Canadian operation closing on July 2 in aggregate our seasonally smaller in the third quarter and will actually produce a drag on overall margin of about 40 basis points. That flipped in the fourth quarter and that will actually bolster overall margins by a point to a point and a half. \nMoving to the brokerage segment non-cash line items for the remainder of 2014. For amortization assume about $48 million of expense per quarter. And for acquisition earn out amortization, assume about $4 million of expense per quarter and depreciation were around about $14 million of expense per quarter. \nThen as we do move on M&A, for every dollar we spend, you\u2019ll need the increased amortization about 1% of the purchase price per quarter now get to pretty close. \nAll right, let me shift now to the Risk Management segment on Page 4. Across the board, a great quarter. Revenues up 8%, margins nicely above our 16% target. They are doing well integrating the carrier book and we are still making a lot of client-centric investments at the same time. \nLooking towards the third and fourth quarter, please note that we\u2019ll give back a little of that margin, because as we have said before, we are holding ourselves to a 16% margin target for the year. After non-cash items, the Risk Management segment and I just assume about $7 million a quarter for depreciation and about $1 million a quarter of amortization. \nLet me shift to Page 5 to the corporate segment. In aggregate, right in line with the mid-point of the range we gave last quarter. However, when you look at the separate lines, you will see that there was a strong quarter from our clean energy investments that cover the additional M&A costs that we spent to close the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canadian operations. \nLooking forward, as you know when modeling the corporate segment, we encourage you to use the shortcut table format we provided on Page 14 of our investment supplement. Not a lot of movement since the first quarter and in terms of our guidance looking out for the next few quarters. But as I say, when it comes to clean energy, earnings for the year can be difficult to predict, so it does have a wide range. Please make sure you consider that when you are doing your model. \nFinally, some comments on capital management, with our secondary in April, and in the debt raise in June behind us, as we look out towards the end of 2015, we would like to have our net-debt-to-EBITDAC ratio back down into the low 2X position. \nThat said, our free cash flows, the dribble out shelf we have, our line credits and the ability to use stock in tuck-in acquisitions, we\u2019re still well positioned to continue our smaller tuck-in M&A program for the rest of this year and well into next year. \nAnd as you\u2019ve heard Pat say our pipeline is full. So we won\u2019t have any problem keeping busy. So, when I step back and take a look at it from the CFO\u2019s chair, we are doing really well, organically, carriers are actually pricing on account and line of cover basis. The economy is moving forward. \nWe are working hard on integrating the larger M&A operations and having success there. We are still closing a lot of smaller tuck-in acquisitions and we have an exciting \u2013 we have a lot of exciting operational improvement and productivity initiatives going on. And our culture is variety. So let me simply put, I think the team is delivering on all fronts. \nBack to you, Pat\nPatrick Gallagher\nThank you, Doug. As Doug said, I think we are hitting on all cylinders. And with that Christine, we\u2019ll go to questions and answers. \nQuestion-and-Answer Session \nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.\nSean Dargan \u2013 Macquarie Research\n \nYes, thanks. Doug, I guess, first thanks for breaking out the impact of raising equity early in the quarter and not really layering in the earnings till the end. I am just wondering what your thought process was around pulling the trigger at that point on the equity raise versus really. \nDouglas Howell\nSimply that, we are committed to do that with Wesfarmers on the deal since we committed to do an all-cash deal with them and frankly we just didn\u2019t want to get caught between the boat and the dock having a large equity raise sitting out there for 60 days waiting to get done. \nSo we sat down with our advisors and they thought it was a good time to go. It wasn\u2019t a bad time in the market given the financial sector that weak, but I was really happy to get it done and get it behind us. \nSean Dargan \u2013 Macquarie Research\nGreat, thanks and what\u2019s your view on using the market option that you have available to you and what factors into using that to I guess, fund further acquisitions?\nPatrick Gallagher\nWell, first of all as we mentioned, it\u2019s not very much, it\u2019s only \u2013 what we have left down is a $196 million on it. So it\u2019s not like it\u2019s that bigger, but of a shelf sitting there. Typically, if we have in the international deal that\u2019s a little bit more difficult to use our stocking acquisitions if we choose to do that. \nSo we\u2019d probably use the dribble out if it comes up in order to do smaller tuck-in international deals or they aren\u2019t necessarily positioned well to take our stock in the deal. But it\u2019s there, just as a liquidity measure. \n\nSean Dargan \u2013 Macquarie Research\nThank you, very much. \nDouglas Howell\nThanks, Sean.\nPatrick Gallagher\nThanks, Sean. \nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. \nAdam Klauber \u2013 William Blair\nThanks, good morning guys. Good quarter. \nPatrick Gallagher\nThanks, Adam. It was a great quarter, Adam. \nAdam Klauber \u2013 William Blair\nSorry, Pat. Couple different questions. How is organic outside of the US?\nPatrick Gallagher\nInternationally, Adam, organic is \u2013 last year at this time, we are running at about 10% organic if you go back and listen to it. But it\u2019s basically running about the same as our domestic operations right now. And if we are going to look for any particular soft spot in international, I would say that then a very small affinity programs we had kind of a game buster quarter last year on it, that didn\u2019t produces quite as much as we reach with some products there. But by and large, we are having some nice large account wins there, but if I were going to try to break it apart, that\u2019s where it would be. \nAdam Klauber \u2013 William Blair\nOkay, okay. And then \u2013 and you mentioned, RPS clearly does a lot of property CAT, does that have an impact on organic coming down this year compared to last year. \nPatrick Gallagher\nOh, yes. That\u2019s why I made it \u2013 in my prepared remarks, that\u2019s why I mentioned it. I mean, our biggest quarter for property placements is the second quarter and property is one of our largest lines in the quarter and it was impacted by probably over 10% reductions. \nDouglas Howell\n\nYes, that\u2019s the one thing caught it just a little bit flat, but if I were going to back and look at our expectations, just a slide in the property market and how it impacted to be \u2013 to pull our overall down 80 to 90 basis points of organic. I guess, that\u2019s looking on the bright side of it casually rates still being up mitigated some of that overall. But that\u2019s the one that, I\u2019d probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to predict that six month. \nPatrick Gallagher\nTo put this in perspective, Adam, we are the largest placer or excess and surplus property risks in the State of Florida. \nAdam Klauber \u2013 William Blair\nRight, yes, and I know RPS is one of the biggest property acquirers out there and they are very \u2013 extremely good. \nPatrick Gallagher\nAnd by the way, this is completely appropriate for our clients. There is no \u2013 about this. They deserve a decrease. They paid up big time after the last catastrophe and this is what the market should do.\nAdam Klauber \u2013 William Blair\nYes, I know, again, it\u2019s normal up and down. What was \u2013 what kind of in your access in Wesfarmers, clearly they\u2019ll not include in organic, but how are those organizations doing on an organic basis? \nDouglas Howell\nNew Zealand doing terrific, Australia, hanging in there kind of flattish from what I can tell, the measurements are little different because as we pull those companies out of where they were before, and Canada is on fire. We think that there is good results up in Canada. \nAdam Klauber \u2013 William Blair\nGreat. Great and one more question on Wesfarmers, Wesfarmers \u2013 particularly I mean, both good sized organizations out of the US. How are you changing your management structure? How you are staying on top of those organizations?\nPatrick Gallagher\nWell, I mean, first of all, Adam, at the detailed level of integration process management that we have is, it\u2019s really unbelievable. It\u2019s like being in a construction truck on a job site. We know every single item that is supposed to occur every single month whether it be a lease renewal or whether it be some account that should be transferred from a different London brokerage into our London operation. \nAnd those work streams are laid out way in advance. These organizations remember, they are very similar to what we\u2019ve been building here in the United States. We got terrific leadership that has been doing acquisitions of bolt-on acquisitions over the last decade. So I said in my prepared remarks, these are niche focused, producer-centric organizations that look and feel just like us. \nAnd they fold into our organization nicely. I mean, in terms of how we manage them, they report into our structure through our international business, but it\u2019s headed by my brother Tom Gallagher and by our CEO in the UK, David Ross and we fold them and move on just like we\u2019ve done for the last 30 years. \nDouglas Howell\nAdam, deals on the back-office side, as you know that there is strong reporting as we manage that, and so what I\u2019d say that the non-production layer, they are strong reporting response lines between the CFOs and me the IT folks and Eric Dean our Global IT leader. \nSo when you look at it, there is the production side of leadership and then there are local management leadership. They are responsible for everything. But with reporting in every reports into their kind of functional leader also. So, just illustratively, for the first 60 days, I had a call almost every day with a CFO of Australia, highly confident for those that might have met her on the secondary road show. Just a terrific, terrific CFO there illustratively. \nAdam Klauber \u2013 William Blair\nOkay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. \nPatrick Gallagher\nThanks, Adam. \nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \nSarah DeWitt \u2013 Barclays Capital \n\nHi, good morning.\nPatrick Gallagher\nGood morning, Sarah. \nSarah DeWitt \u2013 Barclays Capital \nOn the three big deals that you\u2019ve done this year, could you give us an update on how the integration is going? Are you on track to achieve the synergies and could there be any upside there? \nDouglas Howell\nWell, let me hit that. The integration side of it now uses an illustration Bollinger. When we bought Bollinger less than a year ago, they are up completely on our agency management systems. We\u2019ve all of their centralized payables have been moved into our operations already. \nAll the carrier payables have been moved into our central core. We\u2019ve got a ton of their real estate consolidated. The teams are working together and the last thing that really needs to go up is just the phone system to go up on our Voice-Over-IP system. \nIt\u2019s pretty well up, but we\u2019ve got some tweaking to do on it. Clearly, none of these things happen without a lot of hard work. I just want to make \u2013maybe with this opportunity to talk, we understand that we\u2019ve got professionals around the globe that are \u2013 their sole job is to integrate acquisitions. \nThey\u2019ve got the integration experience. They are assigned full time to the process. And also, together our company that has done so many acquisitions, almost all of our systems are built. That\u2019s not only systems but also processes are built to plug in new partners and new organizations into our system. So it\u2019s not like we have \u2013 I\u2019m going to use this is word closed architecture that isn\u2019t receptive at all for new partners. \nSo that is \u2013 basically you can plug and play the new operation. So that\u2019s going \u2013 Bollinger illustratively is going very well. Similar stories with Giles and Oval in the UK. But remember in Canada and Australia too, we are basically using their system. We don\u2019t have overlap to it, really any degree in New Zealand, Australia and Canada. So, we are basically going to be using their systems. So there is not a lot of integration that goes along with it. So\u2026 \nPatrick Gallagher\nLet me take the ball and a little bit, Sarah, on the different angle. What I look at is selling and holding on to clients. Right, so what I am really pleased about is with Noraxes is an example. We have already got people and resources from the US in areas like mining and natural resources, working together with our new offices in places Nova Scotia, working on clients. \nThat is exciting. We are already writing new business throughout Australia on areas that in places that we didn\u2019t have an opportunity before, but with our capabilities now, our people are out calling on clients, saying, hey, this is a whole new world and that\u2019s what is the bell weather to me. Are we holding on to clients? Are we selling more new business? And if that\u2019s the case, that generates excitement and in all three cases, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, very, very good energy. \nDouglas Howell\nAnd then, financially, there is nothing that makes me think that we won\u2019t see our expectations be realized on these financially. So, I think they are delivering to our early measures, there is still lots of synergies and frankly, as we start working more and more with them, we see tremendous opportunities. \nIf you look in the press release to the operating expense table, actually, there we put a footnote in there, the fact that these larger deals run kind of higher operating expenses than what we do. \nThat\u2019s a great opportunity for us to go in there. It doesn\u2019t really impact the people are doing the business we\u2019ll just be able to procure goods and services, will be able to use our offshore centers of excellence better, will be able to our volumes purchasing, health. So, I feel that is a great opportunity to realize our synergies. \nSarah DeWitt \u2013 Barclays Capital \nGreat, that\u2019s a great answer. And then, secondly on the insurance brokerage organic growth, I know you said that prices were flat, you still grow organically. But if we were to look out a year and prices are down mid single-digits, is that still an environment where you think you can grow organically and expand margins? \nPatrick Gallagher\nAbsolutely, again, in my prepared remarks and in Doug\u2019s remarks, we mentioned the fact that even with rate increases in some instances up 5%, 6% over the last three years. The impact on our results has been less than 1%. So our people do a good job of helping our clients renew coverages at cost that are less than what\u2019s been requested, that\u2019s by change in deductibles, changing structure, et cetera. So, if the market is flattish to down single-digits, we\u2019ll do great. \nDouglas Howell\nRemember, some of our clients they are still not buying to our recommended level of exposure cover. I mean, there is lot of on that during the great recession opt to not have covers that they are going to take the risk on. We still see lots of opportunity for our clients to. \nIf there is a slight rate decrease, we will pick up that plus reduce the deductible of that that will increase the top end, Maybe you think about buying another line or two that you opted out. \nSo that\u2019s what our guys are doing there. Every day they say, is your insurance program matching to your risk appetite and then decreasing prices that people tend to buy a little bit more insurance which kind of knocks the downside off of that a little bit. So, we see good opportunity for it in this up two, down two, up three, up down three type environment. \nSarah DeWitt \u2013 Barclays Capital \nOkay, great. Thanks for the answers. \nPatrick Gallagher\nThanks, Sarah. \nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed with your question. \nMark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey \nThank you. Hey, Pat that was a fabulous quarter. Congratulations. \nPatrick Gallagher\nHey, Mark. Good start. \nMark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey \nThe \u2013 would it be possible to share the \u2013 just rough percentages of property, the revenue from property in 2Q versus what you would see on a full year basis, so we get a better sense of that seasonality? \nPatrick Gallagher\nYes, I think that property, if I look at it and our brokerage business, let me give my sheet here that \u2013 let\u2019s stick with wholesaling that in the second quarter wholesaling really 60% of their property placements come in as a percentage of the revenue come in the second quarter and you are down into like the 30% or 40% range in terms of their mix. \nAnd when you look at overall, and you are seeing kind of 30% to 35% as a mix of business in the second quarter but the rest of the year property comprises maybe 20%. So there is a \u2013 depending on which business, but overall for us, the mix of business is, maybe 30% of our business in the second quarter and then 20% for the remainder \u2013 for the other quarters during the year. \nMark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey \nAnd then, revenue seasonality within the acquired businesses are \u2013 I\u2019ll ask that question then I\u2019ll also ask under the circumstances, any just general commentary about the 3Q EPS if you did roughly $0.80 this quarter. \nHow should we think about the Q3, you\u2019ve given us some ideas on the margins and that\u2019s appreciated, but just given the magnitude of the movement in the business this quarter. How should we think about the Q3 relative to the number that you just put up? \nDouglas Howell\nWell, we\u2019ve always shyed away from providing any EPS discussion with respect to our Brokerage and Risk Management segments. So, I hate to say a few markets, I\u2019d rather not do that. In terms of how we see seasonality, with respect to the bigger deals, like I said in my comments, we see maybe a 40 basis point drag on margins in the third quarter because of the lower seasonality of the big \u2013 four actually the five acquisitions that will be in our numbers in the third quarter this year. \nAnd then in the fourth quarter, we see that to be a point to a point and a half up and then when you get out to next first quarter, they have an impact of greater than 150 basis points margin expansion. So, I\u2019d rather not comment on EPS. But there is seasonality in those larger deals and I think if you run it through your models, I think you\u2019ll get to a pretty close answer. \nMark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey \nOkay, thank you. \nPatrick Gallagher\nThanks, Mark. \nDouglas Howell\nThanks, Mark. \nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of John Campbell with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. \nJohn Campbell \u2013 Stephens Inc.\nHey, Pat and Doug. Good morning. \nPatrick Gallagher\nGood morning, John.\nJohn Campbell \u2013 Stephens Inc.\nGreat quarter.\nPatrick Gallagher\nThank you.\nJohn Campbell \u2013 Stephens Inc.\nSo, good Risk Management results, I\u2019d say particularly on the margin line. So, just first, what\u2019s driving that near 17% EBITDAC margin? And then Doug, I know, you guys said, you are still targeting the 16% for the year, which does imply little bit of dating over the back half of the year. So just still assign on some of them that\u2019s opportunity in risk and then maybe just assuming greater scale and maybe even tapering investments which you guys see as peak margins longer-term?\nDouglas Howell\nWell, then I think that business longer-term we like 16 to 17 points of margin in the near term. All right, so we think this is kind of a \u2013 we are at kind of full margin on that business. Again to expand margin on that business, you really need at least 5% to 6% organic growth to expand. It\u2019s not quite as leveraged as it is on the brokerage side. \nOr we say, you need 3% or more in order to expand margins. So, for us, the back half of the year purely it\u2019s the amount of investments we want to make in modernizing our product offering, enhancing our quality, improving our productivity and then adding product lines to \u2013 services to our customers. \nSo, the reason why we \u2013 we are above 16 points of margins and the team held off a little bit in making those investments until we see the organic showing up and it did at 7.6%. So, the rest of the year, we\u2019d like them to give back into continuing to make some product enhancements. \nGetting ready to rollout of new analytics worked in here over the next \u2013 the version three of that, here in the third quarter. But this is just product enhancement, product improvement, client service enhancement and so. And we see ourselves in that mode into 2014 and 2015. A little too early to talk about 2016, but that\u2019s where we see ourselves. \nPatrick Gallagher\nAnd John, let me comment. These are world-class margins in that business and the \u2013 there is heavy investments in IT and in people. When you bring on a client, a large commercial client or a large insurance company, you better have the people at the desk as the claims are coming, trust me. \nJohn Campbell \u2013 Stephens Inc.\nGot it, got it. Thanks for that color guys. And then just on a housekeeping item. It looks like that international quarter \u2013 the flow through is driving up, the brokerage tax rate down and I might have missed this from earlier from you Doug, but just curious about how to think about that brokerage tax rate going forward? I assume the annualized impact from the recent international deals? \nDouglas Howell\nJohn you roll on the lower tax jurisdictions of Canada, get the full impact of the UK with Oval and a lower tax rate again with Australia, you could see that move another point lower in the near term. \nJohn Campbell \u2013 Stephens Inc.\nGot it. Thanks guys.\nPatrick Gallagher\nThanks.\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Farrell with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question. \n\nDan Farrell \u2013 Sterne Agee \nHi and good morning. \nPatrick Gallagher\nGood morning, Dan.\nDan Farrell \u2013 Sterne Agee \nThere is going to lot of focus on the large deals, but while you\u2019ve done these, you\u2019ve also been very active in the smaller transactions. And I was wondering if you could just talk about the current environment and pricing that you are seeing on those smaller deals? \nPatrick Gallagher\nLet me talk about the environment and then I\u2019ll let Doug talk about the pricing. The environment for doing acquisitions just continues to be incredibly strong. And what we see globally is there are literally thousands and thousands of smaller agents and brokers around the world. \nMost of these agencies and brokerages are run by baby boomers. It\u2019s clearly their largest asset and at some point in time, they\u2019ve got to monetize our life\u2019s work. And so, the pipeline just regenerates itself literally month-after-month with people that are considering and some of these things take years to get done. \nI mean, some will move in a couple months but others will be sort of kicking the tires, looking at whether they want to do it, discussing that with it for literally years. And we just are constantly going through the process of looking for number one, people that know how to run a good business. \nWe constantly say, if you don\u2019t make money for yourself and your family you won\u2019t make money for us. But if you run a good business, if you are really good at clients and have a culture that fits \u2013 another thing people say is, how can you put on 17 acquisitions in a quarter and change their cultures? \nWe don\u2019t. If the culture doesn\u2019t fit us, 99% of our due diligence, once we get over the fact that they make money is all about whether the culture match is going to be right. And once we get that set, it\u2019s we can literally show how one plus one can equal a lot more than two. \nAnd so, it\u2019s a \u2013 I think it\u2019s an interesting business situation right now on a global basis. Our opportunities are literally, I mean, just every single month the list just gets longer and longer people who are talking to. And I\u2019ll let Doug talk about the pricing. \nDouglas Howell\nDan, I think that, a good question, we did 14 deals in the quarter for $55 million of revenue that\u2019s back up for about $4 million of revenue per shop. Just terrific sales folks have joined us. We are paying about 7X for that in terms of the pricing. So I see that moving higher not on the smaller deals, I think that\u2019s a pretty fair price for what we are paying right now. \nOver a longer time, we\u2019ve kind of always been in the 6 to 7 times EBITDA range. So we see that holding in there. Some of the larger platforms, if they are large geographical folks may won\u2019t pay a little bit more on that, but right in line with what our expectation, nice asset deals where we get amortized the purchase price that brings our tax rate down on those. \nSo I don\u2019t see a much of a different environment. And I look at the deal sheet, there is hundreds and hundreds of those folks on there. So I see lots of opportunity continue to do that. And the teams are working on it every day. \nDan Farrell \u2013 Sterne, Agee \nOkay thank you very much. \n\nPatrick Gallagher\nThanks, Dan.\nDouglas Howell\nThanks Dan. \nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question. \nMeyer Shields \u2013 KBW \nOkay, thanks. Good morning guys. \nPatrick Gallagher\nGood morning.\nMeyer Shields \u2013 KBW \nWhen you talk \u2013 you talked in the past about how 3% organic growth is generally enough to produce margin expansion. Is that the bright sort of threshold for the international deals as well?\nDouglas Howell\nGreat question. I think so. I think that in the \u2013 most of the environments in which we are operating there, if you take our perhaps Toronto and Sydney and the operating areas I think have enough low-cost environment and I think growth of 3% or more so is a margin expansion opportunity. \nThat said, please realize that New Zealand runs terrific margins, Canada already runs terrific margins. Australia, there is opportunity there. That\u2019s where we see the opportunity to grow margin there. And then, most of the places that we see margin opportunity is because of having more volume, so more premiums that we\u2019re writing that we can negotiate better compensation arrangement. \nAnd then also on the operating side, I think there is opportunities in real estate consumables, co-sharing of IT systems et cetera. So, that\u2019s really where we see the margin opportunities in the operating expense line more than in the compensation line. \nMeyer Shields \u2013 KBW \nOkay fantastic. When you look at the major deals you have done over the last year or year and a bit, are you keeping all of the people that you want? \nPatrick Gallagher\nAbsolutely. \nDouglas Howell\nYes, we\u2019ve really had good retention there. \nPatrick Gallagher\nI have to tell you, Meyer, when we\u2019ve been able to buy people from a private equity concern, five years ago I would have said, we didn't really want to do that. I was wrong. When they get a board \u2013 a brokerage run by brokers, they like it.\nMeyer Shields \u2013 KBW \nOkay fantastic. Good to hear it. \nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. \nKai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nGood morning. \nPatrick Gallagher\nGood morning Kai.\nKai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nJust for the underlying margin expansion for the quarter, Doug, you said about a 40 basis points? \nDouglas Howell\n50 basis points from the \u2013 190 in total, 50 that came from the underlying business, 140 from the four big deals. \nKai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nOkay so it just sounds that 50 \u2013 that sort of 50 basis points underlying margin expansion, given that you sort of that was pretty offset by only like 3.4% in organic growth. So, I just wonder, if you maintain 3%, 4% organic growth, do we expect to see 50 basis margin expansion going forward?\nDouglas Howell\nMaybe, but I think that what field some of our margin expansion this quarter were the increased contingence in the supplemental that have a little bit better impact to the bottom-line. But the big question is, what\u2019s happening with inflation? So, I am not dodging the question. I just don\u2019t know. Right now, wage inflation seems to be under control. \nWe start productivity, opportunities that we can use productivity less the paper raises that our folks deserve. We saw our opportunities on real estate and consumables, IT systems are getting \u2013 there is more demand for IT systems. So, I can\u2019t guarantee if it\u2019s not above 3% that we are going to have margin expansion. \nKai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nOkay, great. Then on the acquisition front, you did like four big deals in very short amount of time. Is it time to take a pause, step back and to focus on integration and running your core business? Or are you still accounting on the lookout of \u2013 remain for the larger deals? And secondly, it looks like you have been planted your flags around all the major English speaking markets. So I just wonder do you have any appetite outside the \u2013 in other markets as well?\nPatrick Gallagher\nWell, let me answer that, Kai, first of all, yes, it\u2019s time for us to digest and focus on integration. We are doing that every single day. So when I talk in my prepared remarks for work streams, we are on top of what\u2019s going on in every office, 70 offices around the UK, 50 new offices in Australia, New Zealand. A bunch of new offices in Canada. We are looking at that every single day and yes it\u2019s time to digest a bit and we are not looking at any substantial new large deals as we speak. \nHaving said that, are we open to doing acquisitions? Absolutely, especially, our bolt-on acquisitions around the world, one of the reasons we are excited about what we did in Australia is even with the size that we\u2019ve accomplished in Australia will have less than 5% market share. \nTerrific opportunity to do bolt-on acquisitions and we\u2019ll continue to do that in Australia, UK, America and Canada. And those bolt-ons will be, as Doug said, on the smaller side. As it relates to non-English speaking territories, you\u2019ll recall, we took a 21% interest in our Mexican trading partner Grupo CP. We\u2019ve opened a small operation in Chile. \nWe will continue to invest in Latin America and we look to continue to expand our global footprint. We are a global company. Over 27% of our revenue and 27% of our people are now outside the United States and we see that as a great expansion opportunity. \nDouglas Howell\nYes, I think the dimension at size-wise here, just that that we are saying, we think it\u2019s really important to put our toe in the water in some of these other countries. We did that in the Caribbean initially with a small deal we did it in Perth, Australia with a small deal that leads the other opportunities. \nBut plunging into non-English speaking countries in a large way right now is not on our strategic plan. Putting our toe in there with a nice $4 million to $5 million agency there that we can learn the country, learn the business, get some smarts on the ground there. I think that\u2019s a nice step over the next couple of years. \nIn the US, when we talk about smaller deals, remember, there are some nice $75 million to $100 million transactions or brokers out there that we think might be coming to market. We would definitely take a look at those. \nWe don\u2019t see $500 million deals out there, $1 billion deals out there that are really percolating around. So when we look at this, you have to think of us not doing something greater than the $100 million in purchase price. But there is a lot of really nice $50 million, $60 million shops out there that are looking to join Gallagher. So we\u2019ll continue to look at those. \nPatrick Gallagher\nRemember though, if you take a look at the \u2013 this month\u2019s business insurance, if you look at the US top-100 to be number 100 in terms of an agency in the United States you got to be $23 million in revenue. So, couple that with the fact that we believe there is something like 20,000 agencies in America. So that is consistent around the globe as well. \nKai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nWell, thank you so much and good luck. \nPatrick Gallagher\nThank you, Kai. We make our luck. \nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski \u2013 BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. \nCharles Sebaski \u2013 BMO Capital Markets \nGood morning. Thanks for getting me in. \nPatrick Gallagher\nThanks Charles. What\u2019s up?\nCharles Sebaski \u2013 BMO Capital Markets \nI wanted to know, just sort of follow-up there on the acquisitions on the benefit side versus the broker side and how you see that queuing up?\nPatrick Gallagher\nWell, that\u2019s a great question. Thank you for answering that or asking that rather. The benefits business right now, let me speak to first domestically in the United States. The new law, basically in my opinion puts smaller benefits brokers out of business. \nWe have 26 people at our compliance department here in Itasca is supporting our US business and 20 of them are attorneys. I mean, you think about the compliance issues for anyone with a 100 employees or more and that\u2019s a huge number of employers in the United States. \nThey cannot contend with this law and their brokers and agents can help them. The simple \u2013 and they are figuring that out. So our pipeline, as it relates to smart, consulting and broking firms in the United States that realize they need our capabilities is extensive and we are clicking off literally an acquisition almost per week when it comes to benefits. \nAnd these are great firms with great clients who know that they need the capabilities that we have to be able to serve those clients. Those that are recognizing that will die, they will be done in the next decade and so, what an opportunity for us. Internationally, the opportunity to expand our consulting as it relates to benefits in the UK, in Canada, in Australia, New Zealand, those are territories for us that are just wide open. \nAnd I think we offer a great compliment to people who would consider joining us in those regions. And we have been very successful. We had a very nice acquisition closed in the UK this quarter and we are very excited about that. Those are capabilities that will actually help us in the US. So, it\u2019s a great business for us. It\u2019s our next multi-billion dollar business in my opinion. And we provide a great home for those professionals that want to join us. \n\nCharles Sebaski \u2013 BMO Capital Markets \nDo those international consultant benefits businesses have a similar margin profile to your current business? Or is it different in anyway? \nPatrick Gallagher\nNo, it's very similar.\nCharles Sebaski \u2013 BMO Capital Markets \nOkay and one of you have any color of \u2013 in how the cross-selling has been working between \u2013 I would especially in the US as you talked about these 100% firms and getting benefits leading into brokerage or vice versa? Any additional insight on that?\nPatrick Gallagher\nAnother good question, Charles. That\u2019s an area that we focus on intensely and it\u2019s significantly improving quarter-by-quarter. And the opportunity is unbelievable. If you take a look at our property casualty brokerage operation in the US and our benefits operation, about 90% of those businesses are not cross-sold. And where both operations are up on salesforce.com and we are looking at that every single week and the opportunities are huge. \n\nCharles Sebaski \u2013 BMO Capital Markets \nI appreciate the answers. \n\nDouglas Howell\nThanks, Charles.\nPatrick Gallagher\nThanks, Charles\n\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs \nHi, thanks. Just \u2013 most of my questions have been answered, but I have one question, just in thinking about M& A, can you talk about how your tax credit fact is into M&A decisions and sort of how scalable those benefits are to the extent that you are able to grow EBITDA through acquisitions? Thanks. \nDouglas Howell\nYes, I think that the ability to repatriate money from overseas in order to bring it into the US and then not pay the US tax on it. There is opportunity there. We did that with the Canadian deal and we did it with the Australian deal and it brings our multiple down on what we paid by about one turn. So we think there opportunities. \nIn the US, obviously generating more US taxable income, there is opportunity to use more of our tax credits to do that. We are running up towards $100 million of earnings a year off of that business right now, we think there's still some more opportunities to move that higher. \nBut, I think after about 2015, 2016, that will kind of be a terminal velocity there. So we see it as an opportunity, but \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we still have done the Australian and Canadian deals without and absolutely. The multiple we paid still was a fair multiple. This was a little bit icing on the cake. We try not to ever do a deal on that, \u2013 we\u2019d never do a deal just because we can use more tax credits. \nThat\u2019s something so you got to get the right deal. But frankly, the ability to grow our US taxable income and use more of our tax credits is an opportunity for us over the next seven years. Remember these programs run out in 2021 and we can produce enough credits maybe to get us to 2023 or 2024. But by and large, it's a nice cash generator to fund these acquisitions for this next six or seven years. But we don't do a deal just because of the credits.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs \nNow, that\u2019s fair. Great, thank you.\nDouglas Howell\nThanks, you Mike.\nPatrick Gallagher\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\nOur next question is a follow-up question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey \nYes, thank you. Any updated thoughts on the exchange opportunity? Is any business changing hands because of the exchanges, either for you or competitors? \nPatrick Gallagher\nMark that's a great question. Let me have that. We take a very strong position on this which is, A. We do have a private insurance exchange that we help to start in partnership with liaison and we offer that as one of the many things that we\u2019ll do for clients. \nBut we look at exchanges as just more of the same, frankly. I mean, our entire history is, going into client offices and helping them sort through what they should do with their risk and what they should do with their benefits. \nAnd these are new opportunities to move to new combined \u2013 new contribution approaches as opposed to defined benefits or defined contribution approach and there are lots of different exchanges. So, really what it does, is it provides again some confusion to our clients. \nIt's difficult for our clients to sort through all of these options on their own. And so it's just more of the same when it comes to sitting down with clients and helping them sort through what should they do the benefits. And remember, it's not just the health insurance spend that clients are dealing with. \nProbably, in most businesses, compensation and benefits is one of their leading largest expenses, right? And benefits as part of that, so what we are helping our clients sort through is, what they do about their workforce. \nWhat\u2019s the strategic approach to keeping their people and making sure that they're giving them the benefits package that\u2019s competitive. That includes health insurance and it may include an exchange and it may not work and that just makes for more work for us.\n\nMark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey \nThank you. \nOperator\nMr. Gallagher, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. \nPatrick Gallagher\nThank you, Christine. I just have one very brief thing to say and that is thank you again everyone for joining us this morning. I already said this, but I think it bears repeating. I could not be prouder of what our team continues to deliver, first to our clients and then secondly to our shareholders. \nAnd the thing that\u2019s kind of fun about being in my seat is that while I am pleased with the quarter, I am incredibly confident that this franchise is just getting started. So thank you for being with us this morning. Look forward to talking to you in the quarter. \nOperator\nThis concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. \n\n",

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, October 26, 2018. Thank you.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Frank Boykin. Mr. Boykin, you may begin your conference.\nFrank Boykin\nThank you, Katherine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor conference call. Today, we'll update you on the company's results for the third quarter of 2018 and provide guidance for the fourth quarter. I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nThank you, Frank. In the third quarter, we generated sales of $2.5 billion, up 4% compared to the prior year. For the period, our adjusted operating income was $314 million or 12.3% of sales with an adjusted EPS of $3.29. In the quarter, start-up costs related to new capital projects were $20 million, in line with our plan. Our third quarter results fell short of our expectations. Sales growth in all segments was lower than our estimates. Price increases had less impact, and we experienced more inflation than predicted. Transportation costs continued to rise due to limited availability of common carriers and higher fuel prices. Additional manufacturing reductions were required during the period to control inventory. Our LVT sales were up significantly, but were constrained by internal production. Our margins were further impacted by a decline in product mix from customers trading down, import competition due to the strengthening dollar and higher volumes in channels which use lower-value products.\nIn the U.S., we continued to execute additional pricing across most product categories to offset ongoing pricing inflationary pressures. Our LVT sales are expanding from both greater internal production and sourcing programs. We announced price increases on products that we import from China to pass through the new tariffs and other inflation. We are increasing our internal trucking to enhance service to our customers and control costs. Approximately 40% of our sales are outside the United States, and most of the major markets have experienced weakening. Sales growth in most of our European products slowed from the prior period, along with the economy, and margins were impacted by cost inflation and a weakening product mix.\nThough political uncertainty has led to a decline in the Mexican ceramic market, we are increasing our sales with product innovation and expanded distribution. In the period, the acquisition of Godfrey Hirst added revenues of approximately $70 million, even as the Australian market slowed due to lending restrictions and reduced exports to China.\nIn our non-U.S. businesses, we are increasing prices as conditions permit, introducing innovative products, expanding our distribution and reducing our costs. We have many investments in new products and geographies that are in various stages of completion from presently being constructed to ramping up with limited utilization and lower product mix. Over time, these projects will progress from starting up with losses to a breakeven position and finally, to achieving our planned margins when sales productivity and product mix are optimized. The combined sales of these potential investments will exceed $1.2 billion and when optimized, should contribute margins similar to our existing businesses. Some benefits of these projects will be realized next year, but most will occur in 2020 and beyond when operating at anticipated levels.\nThe projects already starting up are rigid LVT and premium laminate in the United States, ceramic in Mexico and rigid LVT, carpet tile, porcelain slabs, technical tile and premium laminate in Europe. Other projects under construction include quartz countertops in the U.S., porcelain tile in Poland and sheet vinyl premium laminate in Russia. Even as we addressed the current environment, we are positive about the long-term value of these investments and our sales and profitability. We are confident about Mohawk's position in the global market and our aggressive strategy to deliver long-term profits and returns. Our Board of Directors has approved a new plan to purchase $500 million of our company's stock.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to review the segments. Chris?\nWilliam Wellborn\nThank you, Jeff. For the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment sales decreased about 1% as reported to $886 million, with challenges from inflation, pricing pressures and lower growth in most of our markets. Adjusted operating income for the segment was approximately $119 million or 13.4% of sales. During the period, our U.S. volume expanded, while margins were pressured by price, mix and higher transportation costs. Increased competition from imports due to a strong dollar and the growth of LVT continued to impact the U.S. ceramic industry. We have announced a price increase to recover freight and are taking other actions to improve our mix and margins. We're expanding our larger-size tiles, increasing our technical porcelain collections and growing our porcelain slab offering. Our patented technology to enhance the durability in slips and falls is being well accepted in both residential and commercial channels.\nWe're introducing commercial LVT into Dal-Tile's offering, and we are testing a number of new innovations which could be significant, including a patented technology to reduce the time and cost of ceramic installation and a patented porcelain roof tile system.\nWe are improving our processes to make it faster and easier for customers to place orders and pick up their products. We're enhancing our regional galleries and local showrooms to increase our premium porcelain sales and commercial specifications. In addition, we have consolidated eight service centers and are improving the efficiency of our administrative and logistics organization. As an alternative to imports, we are increasing our direct sales to larger customers who buy in truckload quantities, enhancing their supply chain.\nTo improve our inventory turns, we are presently manufacturing fewer units than we are selling, which is negatively impacting our costs. Next year, we anticipate that production levels will increase and approximate our sales level.\nGiven the changing transportation market, we're revising our distribution strategy to lower our costs by reducing the number of stops we make on each trip. A limited amount of our U.S. ceramic sales is sourced from China, and we are raising prices on these collections to offset recent tariffs. The imports from China had been the lowest-cost alternative from around the world. Because of this, our competitive tile position will improve as U.S. tariffs rise even as purchases shift to other countries.\nIn quartz countertops, the U.S. has initiated total duties of 44% due to tariffs and Chinese subsidies of these products. And additional penalties for dumping are expected. During the period, our countertop sales increased 15%, with quartz growing substantially more. Our quartz countertop manufacturing in Tennessee is preparing to start up in the fourth quarter. We have moved our quartz sourcing to countries that are not affected by tariffs. We should be well positioned to utilize our new quartz production as it ramps up over the next year.\nEven with the Mexican ceramic market declining this year, our sales have increased as we expanded our distribution and introduced additional innovative products. We are currently launching our 2019 collections to enhance our share, improve our mix and better utilize our new capacity. We've expanded our commercial sales organization to increase specifications in large projects with designers and end users. We continue to grow the sales for our products in Central and South America. Next year, our margins should increase in Mexico with better mix and higher volumes as our business expands.\nOn October 15, we executed an agreement to purchase Eliane, one of the largest ceramic tile manufacturers in Brazil for approximately $250 million. Brazil is the world's third-largest ceramic tile market, where Eliane is a leader in the premium porcelain, with annual sales of about $215 million. We anticipate the acquisition closing in the fourth quarter. With additional investments from Mohawk, Eliane's strong management team will upgrade manufacturing assets, enhance product offerings and lower cost.\nMargins at our European ceramic business had been under pressure due to lower industry demand and pricing as well as increased inflation. To manage this, we've introduced more differentiated collections and expanded our commercial offering to improve our mix. Our commercial sales are expanding as we open new design centers and increase our specifications with a more direct sales strategy. In residential, we are increasing our larger-size offerings in porcelain slabs as well as introducing decorative small sizes and unique thin wall tile.\nWe are realigning our sales force by market and channel to optimize our position in each segment. To broaden our distribution, we are offering exclusive programs for our large retailers. We are gaining traction with our new large slabs that were used in countertops, walls and floors. These slabs have industry-leading visuals and are easier to install than existing alternatives.\nIn Bulgaria, we are enhancing our mix with larger sizes and moving into a new warehouse to improve our service and distribution cost. We are transitioning production of lower-value ceramic from Italy to our Polish and Bulgarian operations to improve our competitive position. We are increasing our productivity and reengineering our material formulations to lower our manufacturing cost. In the fourth quarter, we will decrease our production levels to align our sales and inventories for next year.\nIn our Russian ceramic business, sales and volume improved but were partially offset by higher inflation. We have announced price increases of 4% to recover material and labor increases and the impact of a weaker ruble. In the period, our growth has been limited by our capacity, which we are increasing. We are expanding our design centers in major markets to increase our retail position and commercial specifications. Our differentiated products, commercial sales organization and national distribution have made us the leader in the premium commercial channel.\nIn the third quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were approximately $1 billion, increasing about 2%, with an adjusted margin of 9.9%, including start-up cost of $9 million. Sales and volume did not improve as we had anticipated, and mix declined from growth in polyester carpets, customers trading down and higher sales in lower-value channels. Our realized price increases have taken longer to implement and were lower than we anticipated in the quarter. We're seeing a greater impact from our price increases as we enter the fourth quarter. In the quarter, production on our new LVT line was lower than anticipated, but recent improvements have increased output more than 30%. Due to all of these factors, it will take longer than anticipated for our margins to improve. We have announced additional carpet price increases for the end of the fourth quarter to offset further material increases from rising oil and chemical prices. Given this extraordinary inflation, we are enhancing our processes to manage pricing and ensure a more consistent execution.\nOur new home construction in multifamily channels had the strongest performance during the period, and LVT continued to capture a greater share of the flooring market. We anticipate continued growth in LVT as our product offering expands, both with greater local production and sourced products. To better align our new European and U.S. LVT start-ups, the U.S. operation is now reporting to our European vinyl management, and we have transferred an experienced manager from Belgium to lead our U.S. operations. After initiating these changes, we are already seeing significant improvements in the processes and volume of our LVT production. In the U.S., we have successfully produced rigid LVT, which we'll begin introducing into the market.\nOur proprietary SmartStrand Silk Reserve and patented Air.O soft flooring and luxury Karastan collections are continuing to gain share of the premium market. Our waterproof RevWood flooring is gaining share in the retail, builder and home center channels with their superior visuals and performance features. Our consolidated residential sales management now coordinates all retail products, making it easier for customers to satisfy all of their needs with Mohawk.\nOur commercial sales improved as we progressed through the quarter, with hard surface sales significantly outpacing carpet. Our education, government and main street channels outperformed during the period. We're expanding our specialized sales forces to enhance our penetration in all channels. In the period, our sales backlog increased as we expanded the specifications for our innovative new offerings. We are consolidating multiple warehouses and closing two higher-cost manufacturing options - operations to improve our efficiencies.\nOur Flooring Rest of the World segment delivered third quarter sales of $612 million, an increase of 17% as reported or 19% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted margin for the segment was 15.8% of sales, including start-up cost of $8 million.\nAs we moved through the quarter, overall market conditions softened. Our segment sales rose substantially with the recent acquisition of Godfrey Hirst. The segment's legacy growth was 4.6%, slowing from the second quarter's very strong results. In operating income, our higher sales and product mix improvements during the period were partially offset by currency headwinds and higher start-up costs. During the period, LVT led the segment's growth, along with insulation and wood panels. We are increasing prices in product categories impacted by inflation and currency headwinds.\nOur LVT sales grew significantly, even though our new LVT production was constrained as we started up our new line. Engineering solutions have been implemented on the new line, and daily output has risen about 30%. We anticipate continuing incremental improvements throughout 2019 until we match the performance levels of our existing LVT lines. We do not expect to fully load the plant at the optimum mix in 2019. We are producing additional rigid LVT collections to broaden our offering and enhance our market position. These new products feature state-of-the-art realism, dimensional stability and noise suppression.\nIn laminate, our patented waterproof technology, combined with our unique surface textures, are enhancing our mix. The differentiated features and benefits we offer command a significant premium in the market. With our new Belgium production line, we are expanding the offering of these products. In Russia, a similar laminate production line is starting up, and we're introducing the same features to expand our distribution and capture greater share.\nOur European sheet vinyl business is operating at capacity, as we bring to market innovative residential and commercial products with easier installation methods. We have announced price increases of 4% to 7% to cover cost inflation. Our new Russian sheet vinyl plant will start up by the end of the year and provide more product to sell in Europe. Our new carpet tile plant is ramping up production, and we're expanding sales by increasing our sales force and customer base as we bring greater styling and value to the market.\nOur wood panels business continues to show strong results, driven by price increases and improved mix. Our manufacturing productivity has improved from investments we've made in our facilities. In the insulation business, demand for our products is increasing as material costs fall back to more normal levels.\nIn both Australia and New Zealand, the integration of Godfrey Hirst is well under way. The Australian housing market has weakened because of stricter lending standards, higher mortgage rates and slowing exports to China. SG&A efficiencies are being created as we merge Godfrey Hirst's operations with our local Mohawk distribution businesses. We added new carpet tile capabilities to expand our commercial business in both markets, and we've started supplying raw materials from the U.S. to broaden our product offering and reduce cost. Operational best practices are creating new ideas to improve both our U.S. and Australian operations.\nI'll now turn the call over to Frank, who will cover our financial performance for the third quarter.\nFrank Boykin\nThank you, Chris. Starting with the income statement. Sales for the quarter were $2,546,000,000, growing 4% as reported, with our legacy business at 2% on a constant basis. Our Flooring Rest of the World segment had the strongest growth during the quarter. Gross margin as reported was 28.3% or 29%, excluding charges, and was down from 32.5% last year. Inflation of $63 million, higher start-up cost of $10 million, FX headwinds of $9 million and plant shutdowns of another $9 million offset increased volume of $29 million and productivity gains of $5 million. SG&A as reported was $433 million or 17% of sales. Excluding charges, it was 16.6% of sales and compares to 16.3% last year.\nUnusual charges during the quarter were $27 million and primarily were related to the Godfrey Hirst acquisition and plant consolidation. Our operating income, excluding charges, was $314 million or 12.3% of sales. That was down from 16.2% last year. Negative mix offset our price increases, and inflation of $69 million was a drag in the quarter. Higher volume of $17 million was offset by start-up costs of $14 million, FX of $6 million and $9 million for plant shutdowns. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $445 million, and we estimate full year to be about $1.7 billion.\nThe income tax rate improved to 18.8% from 27.6%, as the 2017 U.S. tax reform drove the overall rate down. We estimate a fourth quarter rate of 19%, and in 2019, a full year rate of 22%. Earnings per share, excluding charges, was $3.29, a decrease of 12% compared to the prior year.\nTurning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of $886 million, down 1% as reported, with our legacy business up 1% on a constant FX basis. Our Russian business reported the strongest growth in this segment. Operating income, excluding charges, was $119 million, with a margin of 13.4%, down from 16.8% last year. Inflation of $29 million and declining price and mix of $8 million was offset by $15 million of incremental productivity. In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $1,048,000,000, up 2% over last year. We had our strongest growth in LVT, which impacted most other product categories.\nOperating income, excluding charges, was $104 million, with 9.9% margin compared to 16.7% last year. Lower mix offset price increases with negative productivity of $24 million and inflation of $36 million, influencing our results. Productivity was impacted by lower manufacturing and efficiency levels and higher depreciation, employee cost and SG&A. Incremental start-up costs were $8 million.\nIn the Flooring Rest of the World segment, sales were $612 million, up 17% over last year, with the business up 5% on a constant FX legacy basis. Operating income, excluding charges, was $97 million, with a margin of 15.8%, which was slightly less than 16.2% last year. Increased volume of $9 million and productivity of another $9 million, along with $6 million of higher price and mix, offset inflation of $4 million. Incremental start-up costs were $5 million during the quarter.\nIn the corporate and eliminations segment, the operating loss, excluding charges, was $5 million. We expect the corporate expense to range from $30 million to $35 million for the full year.\nThen jumping to the balance sheet. Our receivables ended the quarter at $1,756,000,000, with DSO of 59 days in the third quarter. Inventories were $2,214,000,000. Inventory days ended at 118, which improved from 119 days in the fourth quarter of 2017. Inflation and backwards integration negatively impacted the calculations. Fixed assets were $4,586,000,000 and included capital expenditures of $145 million and depreciation and amortization of $133 million in the third quarter. We are estimating capital expenditures for the full year of 2018 to be $800 million, and depreciation and amortization is estimated at $520 million for the year. Next year, we estimate capital expenditures to range from $550 million to $570 million, and we anticipate D&A to be $570 million.\nWe look at our long-term debt. Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong. We had total debt of $2.9 billion, with our leverage at 1.5x debt to total EBITDA. We expect free cash flow of $450 million for the full year of 2018.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nThank you, Frank. We anticipate fourth quarter results continuing the soft trends we experienced in the third quarter. We expect sales to be slightly slower than the prior quarter in most markets and product categories. Even with price increases across the company, we will not offset inflation, and our results will remain under pressure. Our margins are being impacted by more competitive environments, declining product mix and lower manufacturing rates. We're introducing new products and executing cost reductions to improve our performance. In the U.S., we are expanding our internal transportation and optimizing our distribution. The Godfrey Hirst acquisition will benefit our results as we integrate our Australian and New Zealand businesses. Taking all this into account, our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter is $2.45 to $2.60, excluding any onetime charges. Based on this estimate, our EBITDA for 2018 will be approximately $1.7 billion. In the first quarter of 2019, we expect some improvement from the fourth quarter, with operating income of $225 million to $250 million.\nPresently softening market conditions, significant inflation and declining product mix are hurting our results. LVT has an opportunity to expand while also impacting the volume, mix and pricing of our other products in the United States. We're reacting to a stronger dollar, which has compressed our margins.\nGoing forward, our results should improve as we align pricing and enhance our product offering. Our new investments are on track with construction start-up and acquisition of customers and will provide profitable returns when optimized. We will continue acquiring premier companies like Eliane to expand our offering and geographic presence. Mohawk is the largest flooring company in the world, with low-cost positions in our products. Mohawk's operational depth, innovative products and strong balance sheet provide competitive advantages to create long-term value.\nWith that, we'll now be glad to take your questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet.\nMichael Wood\nJeff, I wanted to start with getting your opinion on a very high-level argument. As we sit here today, it looks like 2017 was really as good as it gets with high profit margins because of an ideal portfolio mix and pricing power and stable input costs. And now we're in an era of these increased import competition, cost inflation and excess capacity and perhaps declining flooring demand outside of LVT. So what's your perspective on that argument? Why - is it wrong? And are you managing the business to that \"best days are behind us\" philosophy?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWe're going through temporary conditions where you have inflation and the dollar strength and the market conditions, as you said, are negatively impacting it. It has taken us longer to align our pricing with the cost structures than we had expected, and we're adjusting those as we can with price increases everywhere. I think, as we look forward, it will take us this next year to adjust to it. But I think we're putting the right things in place to expand our business. We haven't got the benefit of all these investments we've been putting in, in different categories which, when we get the volume up to a certain level with the right product mix, will significantly enhance our long-term profits. We believe that the profitability of the existing businesses will improve over time and get back closer to where they were.\nMichael Wood\nOkay. And then maybe a specific question. The $24 million productivity - negative $24 million productivity in Flooring North America. I'm assuming that's a net productivity. Is that correct? And what do you think the normal Flooring North America run rate productivity can be when growth stabilizes? And I'm curious on what it'll look like when you begin to lap the heavy destocking period in 2Q to 4Q 2019.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nSo productivity was impacted by lower manufacturing levels and efficiencies, higher employee costs, depreciation, higher SG&A and even some uncovered freight, among others. In the productivity, anything that gets worse ends up in the productivity category. We think it'll continue to lag in the near term, but we expect it to improve over time.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates.\nJustin Speer\nI just - unpacking that fourth quarter guidance a little bit more and in thinking about the big - particularly in the third quarter, this productivity line. I think most - and I think you were looking for that to improve from the $3 million drag in the second quarter. And then you look to the fourth quarter, the guidance implies about 500 basis points plus of margin degradation year-over-year across the business. So I guess, unpack that Flooring North America piece, how much of that is that productivity continuing into the fourth quarter? And then maybe what's your implied margin guidance across the rest of your businesses? Because it seems we need some handholding around how you're going to exit the year and how to shape that as we think about next year in terms of the margin profile and your math as best you can provide it.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWe anticipate continuous soft trends as we go into the fourth quarter, with sales slightly slower. We are continuing to assume that the price increases will lag our raw material inflation. In various markets, as - such as in the U.S., as the markets have slowed somewhat, we're seeing more competitive environments. We have declining product mix, and we're assuming lower manufacturing rates all the way through. With this, we're increasing prices further in almost every product and marketplace. We're putting out new products that'll have higher margins, and we're executing cost reductions to improve where we are. But it will take time to change the margin.\nJustin Speer\nSo in thinking about the price - so we have tariffs rolling in, we have productivity drag - or you have productivity drag, particularly in Flooring North America, that should continue into at least the next couple of quarters. Thinking about getting price, how are you going to be getting price in a down volume environment and then maybe couch that with what you're seeing with tariffs? How, maybe, much price you're going to be requiring to get versus maybe your competition across your businesses?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nThe costs in most of our product categories demand that we increase the prices. And we believe, from the announcements of the other competitors, that there's increases going on in those. The tariffs are - have limited impact so far, but there are increases in Chinese imports announced by others in the marketplace, which should help us implement a price increase in ceramic at the end of the year. The tariffs could rise to the 25% level in January. We think there's a reasonable probability they'll go in because we don't see the countries reaching a rational compromise. So as those occur, they should help improve our manufacturing positions in addition.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Kim\nSo in addition to some of the longer-term questions that obviously people are going to want some handholding on. I guess, one of the aspects that I wanted to zero in on your term was the inventory dynamic. I think you had indicated that you think that sales would be a little lower in the 4Q. I wanted to clarify, did you mean down year-over-year? And I assume you mean down like low single digits year-over-year in 4Q. And then on - but within inventory specifically, I was hoping that you could help us understand or break down what we see in the overall inventory number because it still seems kind of high. In other words, are there big pieces, like was there a buildup of LVT ahead of some launches? Was there - is there any kind of acquisition impact from that inventory that you can break out for us? Or can you break out the inventory build internationally, let's say, versus domestically. Anything that you can give us regarding the inventory and the likelihood that, that will come down relatively quickly would be very helpful.\nFrank Boykin\nFirst, Steve, I just wanted to clarify. You had said sales would be down in the fourth quarter. Is that what you said? Was that...\nStephen Kim\nI thought that was what Jeff had just said, but clarify me if it's wrong.\nFrank Boykin\nNo. No, we don't expect sales...\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nI said sales would be softer. But what's happening is we are cutting back on the production of the piece because at the third quarter, we started cutting back. And we're assuming it's going to be softer going into next year. So we're being more aggressive in the production rates going into the end of the year. Let me get some of it. And Frank, you can fill in the rest. What I'm saying also is that with the raw material inflation, you have the raw materials hitting the balance sheet before the sales prices have gone up. So the inventory turns get worse because the raw materials have increased, and it's showing up in the inventory dollars, in addition to having nothing to do with the units as the prices go up.\nWilliam Wellborn\nStephen, I would just add that we're increasing some of the source materials, like an quartz, for example, and we're taking down our manufactured inventories.\nFrank Boykin\nAnd that was a long question. Did we leave something out there, Steve?\nStephen Kim\nWell, in particular, I'm looking for some numbers, either ratios or something that can give us a sense for what we can - how - because that's ultimately what I think The Street needs, is some confidence around your 4Q and 1Q guidance because we're starting to establish a scary pattern here, where we're sort of getting disappointments on guidance. And so one of the key aspects is your inventory issues - your inventory seems to be continuing to build even though that's something which I know you've been trying to address. So we just want to get a sense of are you being conservative enough in your sales expectation in 4Q and 1Q? And why do we feel confident that the inventory build is going to turn the other way and, therefore, not create all these other problems in 1Q? So it would be helpful if we could get some numbers around what the inventory build looks like, let's say, in the U.S., for example, or breakout pieces that were sort of not part of the regular flow.\nFrank Boykin\nThe inventories are expected to go down in the fourth quarter. And we would expect to continue to see improvement in our inventory turns as we move to the next year.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.\nMichael Rehaut\nFirst, just a question on the $1.2 billion of sales that you expect from all your different new investments over the next year or two. I just wanted to get a sense, the $1.2 billion numbers seems to be a little bit lower than the $1.4 billion, I believe, that you've talked to in the last year or 2. I just want to understand what - if that's correct, what the difference is there. And also, from a timing perspective, how are you thinking about that $1.2 billion fully coming online and \"being optimized\" so that you can generate margins similar to the business? Would that - is that more of a 2020, 2021 event? Any thoughts around when do you think those investments could get up to full strength would be helpful.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nOkay. The difference in the numbers comes from two places. Some of the projects, we have moved out of this additional piece and into the other. We've been talking about this for about two years, so as some of the projects have been moved over. The second is the stronger dollar has impacted the translations of the sales back into U.S. dollars as the dollar has strengthened, is it - so that's the difference in the two. All of the projects are in all kinds of different states. In the remarks we sort of talked through, there are certain ones that are along in the process. There's other ones that are just getting started as you go through. They're all in various stages of completion and ramping up. Then with each of the investments, it depends on the cost of starting and stopping it. In some cases, we go out and sell it at lower margins to try to get the volume going through it, which doesn't help the profitability, but it gets the thing started up faster. In other cases, if the costs are lower, we will ramp it up as we put the sales on in each other. So in all the cases, they go through the stage where you're first underutilized and the mix is poor. Then they get to a point where there's enough volume going through it that they move from a loss to a breakeven, give or take.\nAnd then it usually takes at least a year to get the volume up where you want. And then the next year, we start working on the mix between the two. So it takes periods of going through them depending upon - they're all in different spots a little bit as we start. Some haven't even gotten finished coming out of the ground yet. The new quartz plant in Tennessee, which is going to get helped by all the tariffs that are going on and countertops, the tariffs are for Chinese assisting their suppliers. And there could be future dumping charges on top if they're already up high. That should help us fill up the plant faster, for instance. But all the projects have to go through this process, which is - it takes several years to get them to the optimized point.\nMichael Rehaut\nJeff, I appreciate the color there. Second question, just maybe a couple of points of clarification, again, on forward guidance. In terms of 4Q, when you say the sales slightly slower than the previous quarter, do you mean sales less going down sequentially? But should we still expect sales growth up sales growth year-over-year just - but you're talking about sales declining sequentially? And then in terms of first quarter, with the operating income guidance, does that reflect any of the pricing that you're talking about, trying to set in motion with the additional price increases as you try and offset some of the headwinds?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nSo the sales, we meant that the sales rate relative to the third quarter would be lower because we're seeing softening trends in many of the markets as we go through. Is it - and then what was the rest of the question?\nFrank Boykin\nRest of the question?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWhat's the other part? I forgot.\nFrank Boykin\nI think he's gone.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel.\nJohn Baugh\nI was curious on the guide on Q1 improving. I think it was an EBIT guide. Are you saying that the Q1 EBIT will be above Q4 EBIT?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nThe guidance, I think, was saying that the decrease in - relative to the prior year would improve over the fourth quarter.\nJohn Baugh\nOkay. So that's not saying EBIT in Q1 will be higher than EBIT in Q4?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nQ1 is always a much lower volume than the fourth quarter, and I don't think we're going to change that.\nJohn Baugh\nOkay. Jeff, on LVT and in pricing, I'm curious as to what you're doing, what you're seeing your competition do currently. We've got the 10% in place. And then you've got to contemplate if you're importing the stuff, the 25% at this even as early as now. Do you think if we see materially higher LVT pricing as we go into next year that, that will slow down the rate of growth of that product or not? And I'm curious as to how you think about that and then how that may or may not impact the rest of your business in the U.S.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nThe tariffs, it takes a while for the marketplace to adjust to the changes. And in the marketplace, some people have raised it already. I'm not sure all have at this point because of some inventory pieces, but I think most are going up. If the tariffs go up to 25%, you're going to change the value relationship of it versus other products in the marketplace. And it should have an impact on its use in the marketplace relative to where it is and should change the growth rate and change the alternatives for it. And people may start using other things more. But we'll have to see. But again, it won't happen like a light switch. It's going to have to change over time.\nJohn Baugh\nOkay. And I was curious, Jeff, on the ceramic installation patent that, I believe, you discussed in your release. What - is there any way to - what is it? What are you doing? How revolutionary is it? And maybe your ceramic install cost X per square foot, this process would cost Y per square foot. Some kind of reference to what it is you're doing there.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nIt hasn't hit the market yet. We've been testing it for a period of time. It looks like it's going to work. We have a small production starting up that we're starting ready to introduce it. What it does is when you put in ceramic, it usually takes at least two days to prep the floor, put it in and go to different stages to get the job done. This will cut the time in half by at least half, and you can get the whole job done in a day that would take you two days. Is it - and so the product's going to cost more, but the total install cost should be a benefit and it should cut the time significantly. So we think it has an opportunity to make the industry more competitive and make it easier to train people to install it. And we're on the initial stages of it today, but we think it's going to help the industry be more competitive.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.\nKeith Hughes\nA question on inventory and production rates. On the inventory, it was up about 16% year-over-year. Can you kind of separate how much of that was units and how much of that was from the inflating raw materials? And then, I guess, as we look at production rates in your current planning, I assume it's worse - I assume it's lower in the fourth than the third. What are you looking to begin the year? Does that flatten out in the first quarter?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWe don't have the units and volume here to give you. The fourth period will be significantly higher than the third quarter going into it and in multiple markets and product categories, as I said, as we go into next year with a lower expectation of the volume. And I forgot the last part of your question.\nKeith Hughes\nSorry, so you're saying production - you're lowering your production capacity?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWe're lowering the production below the selling rates in the third quarter. And then I'm hesitating a little bit, the first quarter is always a slower quarter, so it's typically - we don't run as hard in the first quarter, in general, just because it's always lower.\nKeith Hughes\nWhen I say in the fourth quarter, it will be a slower production period than the third, correct?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nYes. In the United States, we have been running the ceramic underneath the sales rate for a period of time, lowering the inventories in it. But - and come next year, we expect to run the rates aligned with our selling.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Clark with the Goldman Sachs.\nDouglas Clark\nThe first one is on the U.S. LVT facility and then actually the new European one as well. How loaded are those at those - at this point? I know you mentioned that 30% increase in the capacity, but I guess, I'm just circling a little bit because I don't know what that base is off of ultimately. So where are we in getting that fully ramped up and utilized?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nYou're dealing with a process that has never been run before and going through. So it's - what happens is you start up the plant running at slow speeds with very simple products. And then over time, you keep speeding it up and you keep adding new products to it. It's not unusual as you go to each incremental stage that something that worked at a slower speed or with less things going on, that things don't work as they're supposed to. And you have to adjust things. What we had in the quarter, we had both software problems, that the software as we tried to speed it up and make it work, the software was not talking to itself properly, and we also had physical mechanical failures where things broke and we had to replace them. These are normal things as we go through. What we believe is that we'll keep going through these incremental changes all through next year and by the end of next year, the production lines should be operating at the capabilities that we expect. Even with that, you're still increasing the market, and you're still adding product to it. So I don't know if - as these things incrementally pick up, it takes time to balance the increased speeds with an increased output with the sales. So you're adjusting the sales strategies. And then typically, you're also - the product mix, when you start, is lower. And we probably will be working more on the product mix in 2020, as it - as you've gotten it settled down and you're putting higher-value products, the product mix will change, So you won't - we won't get the full benefit until sometime in 2020.\nDouglas Clark\nAll right. That was super helpful. And then just in terms of the 1Q guide, I was curious, number one, does that include the acquisition Eliane? And then also, does that include the 25% tariff and the costs potentially associated with the source product on that?\nFrank Boykin\nIt does not include the accretion from Eliane.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nAnd it doesn't include anything for the tariffs since we're not sure that - what's going to happen. And then if the tariffs are put in, again, it's not going to happen overnight. The market just isn't going to flip from one to something else in 1.5 minutes.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.\nKathryn Thompson\nFirst, focusing on margins and understanding there have been a lot of puts and takes, the margin impact in the quarter by reporting segment and by geography. But first, focusing on Flooring North America. We just had the widest and most consistent step-down in adjusted profit margin in 28 this year. So stepping back and looking at the force for the fees, how much of the Q3 and the year-to-date impact is driven by investments or plant start-up, inflation, lower volumes or the other - the other headwinds that you've laid out in the prepared commentary. And really the spirit of the question is to understand what are the internal issues of the controllables versus external and how these can be managed more effectively going forward.\nFrank Boykin\nKathryn, the two largest headwinds in the third quarter for the North American segment were, like I mentioned, $35 million of inflation and then the negative productivity of $23 million. We had shutdowns that hit the P&L for about $4 million, and then we had incremental start-ups that hit us for about $8 million. But the two largest were productivity and inflation. And we're - as Jeff said, we are putting in a fourth price increase at the end of this year to help continue to offset inflation, introducing new products to help with mix.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nThe mix has been a significant piece as the - our sales have traded down from higher-value, more differentiated products with higher margins to lower-margin products as some of our customer base tries to hold price points in the marketplace. And then the other part of it is we have sold more in lower-value categories, so our sales in multifamily and builder, which is lower-value products at lower margins, has increased relative to the total versus the remodeling business on the other side, is it, which is the LVT's impacted the remodeling business at a greater amount.\nKathryn Thompson\nBefore I move to my follow-up question, just to clarify, it sounds like these are more - the majority are more internal-focused and fixable versus external. Is that a - would that be a fair statement?\nFrank Boykin\nWe've still got the pricing and the mix that we've got to address, and some of that has external influences.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nIt's a combination of both.\nKathryn Thompson\nYes. Just on ceramic, how much of trading down on products, in terms of that mix that you talked about, is being impacted by large home builders shifting from ceramic product to lower-priced LBT. And do you see this as a trend going forward? And any thoughts you have about that shutdown from a mix shift for ceramic to LBT?\nFrank Boykin\nThe margin on ceramic is impacted by LBT and the pricing. But it's also being impacted by our mix, we're selling more into the builder channel, for example. And the other thing that's impacting our margin is higher freight cost which we've not been able to recover in pricing. We are taking a price increase in the fourth quarter that should help us a lot.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nSo part of it is that we are taking a larger share of lower-value products as the ceramic industry has slowed down. So that's part of the mix shift. And then this freight piece that he talks about, the freight part we sell ceramic all landed. And we haven't recovered the freight. But we think with the tariffs and pieces, it offers us an opportunity to recover part of the cost.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley\nSo on the price side, Jeff, you've generally been successful in mostly offsetting inflation historically. So could you just elaborate on what is different this time? Why is there seemingly limited ability to improve pricing here? Is it really that mix is just a full offset or - I mean, ultimately, what visibility do you have to getting traction on the pricing side?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nTwo things. One is on the carpet side, the amount of it and the frequency of it has made it difficult to continue to get them through there. It's made it harder to read the competition and to react in the marketplace as we go through. And then they all don't go in on day one, they flow in overtime as you go through. So all those things have made it more difficult than usual. And because of the amount of changeover time, it's increasing the amount of trading down to lower-priced products to keep the price point which is also affecting the mix, which is offsetting a lot of the price increase. On the ceramic side, the biggest impact is this cost of freight. It is heavy and you move it, and the U.S. freight rates have been going up dramatically. And with the dollar strengthening, we haven't been able to recover all of the pricing. But we think we're going to get more of it in the fourth quarter than we have all year. And at the same time, we've talked about the same thing going on with mix. As the volume has been impacted in the United States, we're selling more lower-value products, all of which end up impacting the margins. And it all looks like price, but it's not all exactly price.\nMatthew Bouley\nOkay. Second question just on productivity in North America. Jeff, you made the comment that several items, obviously, end up in North American productivity. So I mean, is the suggestion that really you need to see a volume recovery there to kind of see that swing around? I guess, in other words, I mean, what would be the right way to think about the level of volumes you would need to return to generating productivity in that segment?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nThe productivity is impacted by the unit volumes, but there are also other inefficiencies of things going on as we go through. We talked about even some of the freight charges end up in productivity. If they're not billed to the customer, they end up as a difference in last year versus of this year internal cost, which ends up in productivity. So I think the productivity will improve over time, but it's not going to improve tomorrow.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Dahl\nThe first question goes back to the topic of kind of a trade-down effect in pricing. I guess, I'm curious, just the pricing has been consistently met over the last couple of quarters, at least with this trade-down effect. As you're thinking about kind of customer behavior and what you're hearing back from the customer, what gives you the confidence that this will improve as you look at your 2019 pricing actions? And ultimately, the second part of this is, you've talked about slower growth, but do you expect organic growth to be positive in '19?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWe expect to get more price increase in all the different product categories, and every dollar we get helps improve the margins and offset the raw materials that we have. So we're expecting that to better align as we go through. We're taking actions with the new products to put out products that have higher margins, which should help it. But selling lower-value categories will continue in the piece from where it is today. I don't see that changing as we try to operate the business and get whatever share we can in the marketplace as we go through.\nFrank Boykin\n2019 sales growth.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWe expect it to be up.\nMichael Dahl\nOkay. And I guess it...\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nOne more thing. Part of the up to though, with the margins, all these new pieces we talk - I've gone over a few times of how they go. So in some cases, the volume's going to go up, but the margin's going to lag until the plants hit the cost structures they need and the mix.\nMichael Dahl\nWell, that's my second question, Jeff. Because if you look at the 1Q guide, your operating income down about $60 million year-on-year. You've made those comments consistently through the call about this is still going to be a transition year. 2020 is the optimization year. And so if you think about that where you're positioned after 1Q, again to try to put a finer point on things, do you expect operating income to improve in 2019 versus 2018 in dollar terms?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nThe business - I think what we try to put forward is that the business will continue to be pressured next year, that the prices will not cover all the mix, inflation and pressures that we've been talking about. That - we have said that the income in the first quarter will be down. Over time, we expect the pricing mix and inflation to be better aligned. But the industry pressures across the market would have to improve for us to exceed 2018 earnings next year.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America.\nJohn Lovallo\nThe first one on the CapEx guide for 2019 of 550 to 570. That's a pretty good step-down, kind of brings you back to 2014, 2015 levels. Now I realize that the past couple of years have been elevated given some of the spend. But are you guys delaying any spending in 2019, given what you're seeing in the market?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nFirst is a portion of that is still paying for those new investments. Even though the equipment's put in, typically, you pay for it in some time to make sure it does like it's supposed to. So there's lags in the investments. So it could be 20% or more of next year's budget's paying for the stuff that's going in, in the third and fourth quarter of this year. So the ongoing pieces, you have to take those out. And then if you look at the other parts, almost all the investments were very little going into increasing capacity anywhere is going into improving efficiencies. And then you have the normal maintenance and things you have to invest in as a typical thing. But that's the big chunk, so...\nJohn Lovallo\nOkay. And then next question is just on your - the $500 million of repurchase authorization put in place. How quickly can you guys get in the market? And how aggressive do you intend to be given where the stock is?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWe think the stock is undervalued, and we - the window opens on Monday. And we plan to be in the market, purchasing stock.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo.\nStephen East\nThe first question. I guess if you look at your major product categories, how much are raw materials roughly up year-over-year? And then here in late October, I know you're still seeing raw materials go up. But if inflation stopped today on those major products, how long would it take you all, do you think, to get flush with your pricing versus how much raw materials have gone up?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nIf inflation stopped today, I would hope that we would get most of the increases through in the first quarter and be more aligned. But some of the things are at different levels than they were. You got - I got to keep putting apart, one's inflation and one is this change in the channel mix and change in the product mix that we're doing. So as we go through the market, we are changing - the average value of the products is lower and the average margin on the lower mix is lower. So it's a combination of both. The mix won't change even if we could magically get rid of the inflation today, which is causing the compression.\nStephen East\nYes, sure. I appreciate that. And then the other thing I had is sort of a compound question. If you look at the U.S. end markets, are you seeing - could you sort of give us an idea of which ones are behaving the worst, which one's behaving the best? And then if you look at your cap utilization rates right now of your major product categories, however you want to answer it, whether it's at what level are you running today, or how much below a normalized level, like maybe earlier this year you're running - just so we can have some magnitude of what type of capacity flexibility you may have as we go through '19.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nYou guys are asking the questions so long, by the time I get to the end, I get confused what the questions were.\nStephen East\nExactly. The first one's the U.S. end markets, what are you seeing?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nOkay. The U.S. markets, what's happened is that a large part of the remodeling business is being impacted more, so the retail remodeling business, there's more pressure on the other products as LVT takes a bigger share, in that one versus the others. So you're seeing less of it in the new construction and the multifamily. But it's there, but it's not at the same levels as that one. So that's probably about what's happening with the channels. And the second half was?\nStephen East\nThe second half, just looking at your major products, where your capped utilization rates are right now and trying to understand how much flexibility and expansion you may have as you go into '19, ignoring your CapEx that you're putting in place. Just really trying to understand how much you've had to pull back from, say, where you were earlier this year.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nI mean, all the different product categories, if you say LVT took 100% of the industry growth, and everything else is about even. And then we're seeing lower unit volumes in most of them. So all of them are being cut back everywhere. And that's where you see us moving into lower-value products, which we might not have taken as much of in prior years or period, that's compressing the mix, and they're all interrelated.\nFrank Boykin\nSteve, in some cases, like ceramic, we're taking down in the fourth quarter, both in the U.S. and Italy because it's the most economical time to take out inventories for us.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nYou can't start and stop those. You have to stop them for a significant periods of time. So we're stopping and going into the fourth quarter even more.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.\nPhilip Ng\nCan you provide some color how to think about some of these start-up costs for '19 versus '18 and the cadence of that? And how we should think about productivity for next year, assuming you're done drawn down production? Because as you kind of highlighted, you still have a handful of projects that are coming up late this year, early next year.\nFrank Boykin\nStart-up costs will be down significantly next year. It could be down as much as 50% from what it ran for the full year this year.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nCan you give him an estimate for next year?\nFrank Boykin\nNo, I think, this year, as we said, it's going 65 to 70, so it could be half of that next year.\nPhilip Ng\nAnd what about on the other productivity targets? Do you have a good handle on that?\nFrank Boykin\nI think the best we can say right now is it should improve as we go through the year, particularly once we get out of the first quarter.\nPhilip Ng\nGot it. And Jeff, I just want to confirm I heard you correctly. So you're expecting organic growth to be up next year. But given some of these headwinds you called out you're seeing in the market, a couple of price costs, you're expecting legacy EBITDA and legacy EBITDA margins to be down year-over-year in 2019 until most things kind of inflect from here?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nYou have this mix change that I keep talking about, about selling more lower-value products, which is impacting the margins. And that's going to continue for the foreseeable future. On the other hand, we do expect to get the pricing more aligned than it has been. So that's going to help. And then the industry will have to see where it goes. I'm still assuming the industry's going to be up next year.\nPhilip Ng\nOkay. Are you planning to roll out any bigger initiatives to take out more costs, ratchet head count and just potentially even push out some of these growth projects given increased competition and slower growth in general?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWe're going to continue working on the costs of all our businesses. And we've taken various actions, some of them we talked through already. We consolidated a couple of service centers. We are taking out some older cost assets as we speak. We're consolidating some warehousing in different parts of the country. We continue to increase the efficiencies and production of all the different businesses.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nSusan Maklari\nMy first question is around - there's obviously been some sense that markets have slowed globally. You noted Europe as well as the U.S. Is there anything that feels different to you in terms of the - perhaps the outlook for one region versus the other? Do you expect more growth to come through next year in the U.S. or in Europe versus the other?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nI'm not so sure my ouija board is any better than yours at guessing the future. I can say that like Mexico, Mexico, last year, the ceramic business grew double digits. This year, it's negative. I have no idea what's going to happen with the NAFTA behind and where it is. We believe it's going to get better, for instance. In Europe, the first half of the year was stronger, and we've seen weakening across almost all the markets. As we go through, there's a lot of political things making people uncomfortable. And I'm not sure how they're going to translate into next year's growth, and in particularly on all parts and pieces. In our ceramic business, we have a large business in Italy, and there's all kinds of confusion over the political environment as it goes through. So at the moment, we're just assuming all of them are going to be somewhat softer. But I can't tell you that we have any insight that's going to tell us how much or what's going to happen.\nSusan Maklari\nOkay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the Eliane acquisition, Brazil's obviously a market that you've talked about for a while. Why did you decide that this was a good time to get into this? And how should we think about the growth that may be that can sort of add to your business over time?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWe've looked in Brazil for a long period of time, and we've talked to a lot of companies. And the ceramic industry had gone through a downturn, and it's coming out of it. We think that it's improved, and that allowed us to come to an agreement with one of the companies that we think is one of the best down there in Brazil.\nWilliam Wellborn\nYes. I would just add that we've had discussions with Eliane probably 15 or 20 years. The - it's an excellent family, excellent management team. They have the number two position in Brazil, which is the - a huge market and has the best brand in the market.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nSo we think it gives us a good position to grow from. And we started in Europe, and we bought one business in Italy. And now we have positions in Italy, Spain, Bulgaria. We're building one in Poland. So it's a large market where ceramic is really strong, and we're hoping that it will give us a foothold to expand the business much better. Their business has always been constrained by capital, and we think we can provide them more capital and we can help them beyond that. So it seems like an opportunity to expand on a long-term basis.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital Markets.\nLaura Champine\nJeff, it's about the trade-down you're seeing with customers. Can you give us a little history lesson of when the last time was that you saw a trade-down of this magnitude across your businesses? And how long it took you to recover and what it tells us about where we are in the cycle?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nSo normally - there's two parts. One is you have - you always have trading down when you have inflation. So whenever you have high rates of inflation, you see trading down as people try to maintain price points in pieces. Now usually, the inflation amount, it doesn't - isn't as great as this, so there's more trading down going on. At the same time, you see a channel mix change with us, whereas LVT - this one's different as LVT is taking more of the growth in the normal channels, we are getting more volume in lower-value price points. So that's not a normal circumstance in this. Normally, we would have that circumstance in a recession, and it's not for the same reason. In a recession, we try to optimize our price mix and maximize our margins when business is good. In a recession, what happens is we start taking lower-value, lower-return products to keep the assets running. So this time, it's caused more because the industry volume is more. And then all this together then changes the competition in the marketplace as everybody's reacting to the situation.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor\nIt's been a long call. I'll keep it to one question. But Jeff, just a strategic question on ceramic. I guess if the market's shifting to a greater degree of import sourcing, does it make sense for Mohawk to begin supplying the U.S. market with your foreign capacity maybe over the longer term, because I know you got a lot on your plate right now, but over the longer term investing sort of foreign nontariff export platforms that can you allow you to more competitively serve all segments of the U.S. market?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWe have - with the prior moves in Europe, with Bulgaria, we have a - Bulgaria is the lowest labor area in all of Europe, and it could be one of the lowest ones in the world. We have Brazil, which is a lower one which is new. We're in Mexico, which is also low. So - and we have Poland, which is also low. Now on the other hand, ceramic has high freight so we can - it's not that we can't compete. It's that our margins are less. As the dollar strengthens, our cost positions allow us to compete, except the competition is reducing our margins. And we try to balance the volume with the pricing that we do.\nWilliam Wellborn\nYes. I would say in every market, we are the low-cost producer and we have the best product offering and the best distribution in every market that we're in. The strong dollar in the U.S. is causing imports to be more competitive than they normally would. But even in the U.S., we're a low-cost producer.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard\nTwo questions. First of all, the competitive dynamic you're talking about in the U.S. regarding the LVT and imports, how do you feel about that happening in Europe in a similar way?\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nEurope is a totally different market, and it reacts different. And then you can't really even talk about Europe as a whole because each country and the dynamics and where they're located are different. The U.S. is used by a lot of countries as the dumping ground and has always been. In ceramic, I think 50-something percent of the ceramic sold in the United States historically comes from somewhere else. So we're used to competing in this environment with it as you go through. In Europe, you have a different set of dynamics. So our European business out of Italy is based on mid- to high, and we have very little sales in low coming out of our Italian operations. Different than our Bulgarian operations. They focus mostly on the mid- to low end, and we're expanding capacity to ship more into the rest of Europe from Bulgaria. But that's not our core business as you go through. But in Europe, in the last 1.5 years or two, they have increased the production of ceramic. And then what happened is the ceramic industry has slowed down, so the competitive nature of the market has changed in the last 4 or 5 months from where it has been. And we're having to react with pricing as well as other things in the marketplace. But in LVT it is not accepted and it's not as broad as it is here. You get down into the southern part of Europe, I mean, they've been using ceramic in huge quantities for thousands of years. It's embedded in their culture. And again, each market's a little different. So we don't expect that LVT will reach the same levels, but it's increasing. And we are one of the largest participants in it over there.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, that is all the questions we have for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lorberbaum for closing comments.\nJeffrey Lorberbaum\nWe have temporary conditions that we're adjusting to. Our business' investments will improve our margins and our profitability over time, and our new investments will be optimized when we get the volume and mix where we would like it. We're well positioned for the long term. In the short term, we're really focused on improving our margins in the various businesses. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\n\n",

Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call is being recorded. And now, your host for today's call, Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Public affairs. Mr. Elicker, please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Elicker\nThanks, Rufus, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us to review our Q1 results. With me this morning are Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. They'll both have prepared remarks. And joining us for Q&A are Elliott Sigal, our Head of R&D; Beatrice Cazala, Commercial Operations; and Giovanni Caforio who runs our U.S. business.\nFirst, before we get started, let me take care of the legal requirements. During this call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.\nLamberto?\nLamberto Andreotti\nWell, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We have just completed another good quarter. The external environment is certainly not becoming easier, particularly in Europe. We had challenges across all dimensions, but Bristol-Myers Squibb is staying on course. We continue to execute our strategy in a consistent manner. Our focus remains balanced on both short-term results and long-term growth as we keep increasing our sales and earnings, while delivering clinical and regulatory results.\nTaken together, we started the year from a good position. With respect to sales, we grew by 5%, and this growth was broad-based and included some of our more recent product launches. I was particularly pleased with the performance of our virology franchise and other key in-line brands, including ORENCIA, SPRYCEL and ONGLYZA. For YERVOY, we had strong stable demand in the U.S., and I am particularly encouraged by improving U.S. trends in recent weeks and increased adoption in the European markets.\nWith respect to regulatory developments, we are moving forward on multiple fronts, 2 of which are especially significant. Regarding FORXIGA, which for those of you who do not know it yet, is the brand name for dapagliflozin, we have received a positive opinion from the CHMP in Europe. We expect the decision on marketing authorization in a few months and together, with AstraZeneca, we are already planning for an eventual launch.\nWe are glad about this European recognition of FORXIGA's benefit/risk profile for treating type 2 diabetes. And also, by the fact that the agency spoke specifically of the need for additional treatment options, while highlighting the significant unmet medical need in diabetes. We will work with the FDA to clarify a path forward in the U.S., and we continue the regulatory process in all other geographies.\nRegarding ELIQUIS, we are looking forward to the FDA's upcoming decision on the atrial fibrillation indication, which will hopefully be followed by decisions in Europe and Japan where we have also filed. In partnership with Pfizer, our focus now is on implementing the most effective launch plan.\nWith respect to clinical developments, our pipeline remains robust and encouraging. As discussed at last week's EASL meeting, we are increasingly well-positioned to meet the unmet medical need of the 170 million people worldwide who are chronically affected by hepatitis C. The data presented highlighted the broad portfolio of HCV assets that we have today, including a first-in-class NS5A inhibitor and demonstrated our diversified hepatitis C strategy based on multiple mechanist and combinations.\nThanks to the acquisition of Inhibitex and its potent nuc, we have broadened our portfolio of investigational HCV compounds and increased the potential opportunities to provide the right regimen for diverse patient populations. This is a high priority for our company, and we are devoting significant resources to it.\nWe are also making good progress with our immuno-oncology late stage pipeline, from our YERVOY development program, exploring additional indications in prostate and lung cancer, to our work with anti-PD-1 and other potential important asset entering Phase III for renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. We plan to present data on anti-PD-1 at ASCO.\nSo we are moving forward on many fronts and maintaining our focus on balancing both short-term results and long-term investments, remaining firmly committed to commercial execution, as well as scientific advancement. This balance is particularly important as we continue to transition to our portfolio of the future and build a foundation for sustained long-term growth.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Charlie who will give you some additional information and walk you through some of our numbers. Thank you.\nCharles A. Bancroft\nThank you, Lamberto. We did have strong operating results to start the year. In the first quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.64, an increase of 10% over 2011. Sales growth across our key products was partially offset by an increase in investment spending. We reported first quarter net sales of $5.3 billion, up 5% compared to last year. Volume was down 1%, partially, driven by PLAVIX and AVAPRO, which I'll touch on later, price was favorable by 7% and foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact on sales. As Lamberto mentioned, we are pleased by the trends of our key brands that are important to our future growth. Let me provide a few highlights.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the performance of YERVOY. As the U.S. melanoma market continues to evolve, share for YERVOY was stable in the quarter, and as Lamberto stated, we have seen encouraging weekly trends over the past month or so. During the quarter, we reported YERVOY sales of $154 million, with U.S. sales of $117 million. In all markets where YERVOY is commercially available, we are focused on ensuring that physicians understand the long term survival profile of YERVOY.\nWe continue to make progress on access and importantly, we received a permanent J code in the U.S. earlier this year, which has helped to reduce the reimbursement cycle times. As you know, the process for getting access and reimbursement in Europe takes time as negotiations take place in each country. We believe we are making good progress with positive decisions in Belgium and Netherlands this quarter.\nOur virology franchise had a very strong quarter with BARACLUDE and SUSTIVA delivering sales growth of 18% and 13%, respectively. International sales of REYATAZ were impacted by the timing of a tender in Brazil that occurred during the first quarter last year that we expect to occur in Q2 this year. The ONGLYZA franchise delivered $161 million of sales. In the U.S., the franchise delivered 10% prescription growth sequentially versus Q4, with KOMBIGLYZE up 22%.\nGoing forward, we are focused on driving adoption earlier in treatment as the first add-on to metformin, leveraging our head-to-head data versus sulfonylurea, and our label update for the use of ONGLYZA in combination with insulin. SPRYCEL was up 34% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first-line indication. We continue to make share gains in both first-line and the continued expansion of the second-line opportunity.\nThe ORENCIA franchise was up 28%. Our IV volume continues to outperform the market, up 4% compared to 1% for the overall market. ORENCIA subcu was launched during the fourth quarter last year in the U.S. and had sales of $31 million in Q1, which includes a modest impact from de-stocking. The prescribing physician base is broad, and we are encouraged by the business coming from new ORENCIA prescribers.\nGlobal sales for ABILIFY were flat. Total prescriptions in the U.S. were up 4%, outperforming the overall market, but reported sales were down 4% due to de-stocking and another step down in our Otsuka contractual share to 51.5%.\nFinally, you know that we are coming to the end of the market exclusivity period for PLAVIX and AVAPRO in the U.S. and have lost exclusivity in Canada. During the quarter, sales for PLAVIX and AVAPRO were down 4% and 29%, respectively, driven in part by U.S. prescription trends.\nNow let me just give you a few comments from the rest of our P&L. As John mentioned, I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results, where reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release in our website. Gross margin was 75.2%, up 150 basis points compared to first quarter last year. This favorability was driven primarily by favorable product mix and foreign exchange. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 8%. This was driven primarily by increased investment behind new brands. Also included was a $12 million bad debt expense in Europe.\nIn terms of the rest of the year, we still believe that MS&A will decrease compared to 2011 per our guidance. You may recall that in Q4 2011, we increased investments and recorded certain onetime expenses which we do not expect to recur in 2012.\nAdvertising and promotion expenses were down 9%, reflecting decreased spend behind PLAVIX and AVAPRO. R&D increased 2%, driven by overall portfolio spend. The effective overall tax rate was 26.7% in the quarter. The increase compared to first quarter 2011 is primarily due to 2 factors. Firstly, the R&D tax credit has not been extended yet. We assumed the extension on our full year guidance, but it will not be reflected until it is -- the rate is approved. Second, last year, we had certain discrete tax releases that did not recur in 2012.\nNow turning to guidance. You have seen that we have confirmed our 2012 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.90 to $2, and there is no change in our line item guidance.\nI would now like to turn it over to your questions.\nJohn Elicker\nThanks, Charlie. And Rufus, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A. And just a reminder, that in addition to Lamberto and Charlie, we have Elliott, Beatrice and Giovanni here to answer any questions you might have. Rufus?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.\nJami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nI have a few questions related to the company's hep C program. Obviously, the data that was presented at EASL, the combination of your NS5A with Gilead's 7977, was very positive. My questions to you are this though. Just given Gilead's public stance that it is likely to develop its own combination, just if you can fill us in on what Bristol's development path forward is, and specifically where we are in the de-risking process of your own nuc? Secondly, will you comment on the study dose of 50 milligrams of 189? My question is this, is this a new consideration to go forward for the Phase III or is this part of the study design that has been in place? And then just thirdly, on your NS5A, what is the timing to getting that product to the market just according to clinicaltrials.gov, it looks like you're starting a Phase III trial for the genotype 1b population and just wondering what the sort of overall strategy is?\nElliott Sigal\nSure Jami. This it Elliott. Let met try to take those questions. First of all, we too are extremely excited by the field's reaction to very strong data presented at the European Liver Conference. This showed, for the first time, the combination of 2 oral agents achieved in a Phase II study, 100% cure of genotype 1 patients. Based on the strength of this data, we feel it's in the best interest of patients that the 2 companies pursue vigorously a clinical collaboration. And should Gilead decide to do that, we are quite open to discussions. Having said that, I am more confident than ever of the potential of our broad portfolio. The success of this trial validates our acquisition of Inhibitex, the addition of a very potent nuc, 189, to our hepatitis C portfolio. And we are -- we have plans to combine that agent with several agents, including, of course, daclatasvir, our lead 5A compound. If we step back a bit, we've been talking for some time as what it would take to achieve an all-oral regimen, and we're happy to be one of the handful of companies in the forefront here. There's some success, but there's some unanswered questions. It's clear now that monotherapy will not be sufficient. It's possible that just 2 agents will be sufficient. It's possible that a nuc may not be the only important ingredient. Some of the data presented at the conference mentioned a non-nuc. So our portfolio is very strong with the nuc, a non-nuc, a 5A, a protease and multiple collaborations. Some of the unanswered questions have to do with exactly which combination mechanisms are going to be required and whether 12 weeks or 24 weeks of an all-oral agent will be sufficient. And again, we have multiple options. So let me address first the plan for our 5A, which is well underway and where we are with the earlier program in our nuc and its progress. We believe that not all 5As are the same. Ours is differentiated first, and at present best-in-class. And we've presented important data with a protease, as well as with the nuc now. We started our Phase III program for daclatasvir in 2011, and we will continue to roll out additional studies throughout this year. Our Phase III program for daclatasvir will include studies in combination with other oral agents, as well as on top of interferon-based regimens. We will also have an active control for an approved protease inhibitor. Importantly, we see a major commercial opportunity in Japan, and we have started a Phase III combination trial, which is going very well, combining our protease inhibitor with our NS5A. We expect that this trial to be registrational, and it should complete in 2013. We also plan to start a related trial with the 5A and our protease inhibitor in null and partial responders, patients that are intolerant to PEG riba and also treatment naive patients that have the genotype 1b, and this will be a global trial relevant to the U.S. and Europe and other countries. The registrational trial will complete around 2014. In addition, adding this dual regimen on top of PEG riba forms a quad that we feel will be very useful in many situations for salvage. And we've had very encouraging Phase II data. This is moving into Phase III in the U.S. and Europe in null patients, and it's registrational program could complete in 2013. We also have several other trials where we add daclatasvir on top of interferon for special populations that will complete in 2014. Now I am, as I said, even more excited about our nuc from Inhibitex than at the time of registration because of the new data. You referenced a 50-milligram dose that would only be one possible dose we would use. We feel that there are multiple doses that are safe for human testing from 50 to 200. We will be getting more experience with 200 throughout this year. We will have safety data on a range of doses of 50 to 100, which we will at least have internally and hopefully talk about towards the end of the year. We will initiate a Phase IIb study later this year with our nuc in combination with NS5A with the range of doses, and this will help inform the doses and regimens to take forward in a 2 component all-oral agent into Phase III some time in 2013.\nOperator\nAnd for our next question, we go to Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.\nAlison Yang - Barclays Capital, Research Division\nMy name is Alison Yang. I'm calling in on behalf of Tony Butler. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on ipilimumab. Firstly, could you give us a sense on first line and second line penetration based on BRAF status? Secondly, could do you comment on -- at ASCO we'll see a series of results from Roche's ZELBORAF, including BRIM, Break 3 [ph] and Break MB [ph]. How do you expect that, that's series of data will impact the volatility in that melanoma market?\nLamberto Andreotti\nSo let me start, this is Lamberto. Let me start with a couple of general comments about YERVOY and then I will ask Giovanni to continue. And Elliott, if you have to add something, please do it. First of all, let me say that, as you are all aware, this product YERVOY, is a very important product for metastatic melanoma patients, their physicians and of course, for our company. We are continuing to focus on ensuring that the truly differentiated long-term survival profile of YERVOY is well understood by oncologists in all the countries where it is commercially available. There is a lot of work behind this. As both Charlie and I said, in the U.S., we saw strong sales in Q1 and in addition, in recent weeks, we have been seeing some even more encouraging trend in demand. Though reimbursement and access environment outside of the U.S. continues to be somehow challenging, we continue to pursue -- ensure that as many patients as possible have access to YERVOY. And for those countries where the product is commercially available like Germany, we are glad to see that it is doing well and in the other countries we keep working diligently the pricing and reimbursement processes. Now Giovanni why don't you give some more color on -- about what we are doing of the U.S.\nGiovanni Caforio\nYes, good morning. This is Giovanni. As Lamberto said, we had a strong quarter in the U.S., with sales of $117 million, which is stable both in terms of sales and shares versus the previous quarter at a time in which the market continues to evolve. Going to your question, our share of new treatment initiations in the first quarter was again similar to Q4. We saw very high shares in BRAF negative patients across first and second line, and we continue to see using BRAF positive patients, including the first-line setting. At this point, approximately 70% of our business is coming from the first-line use and 30% of our business is coming from second line. Now as Lamberto also mentioned, in the last few weeks, we've seen encouraging trends in terms of demand and sales in the U.S. More importantly, as more physicians have become experienced with using YERVOY, we've seen that the perception of the product has continued to advance. Physicians are valuing increasingly the long term survival benefit for YERVOY and are becoming comfortable with its use. And we've seen continuing increase in the number of accounts ordering and using YERVOY. In terms of our thoughts regarding the transition in the market and further evolution of metastatic melanoma, I would say, the last 12 months have seen very, very significant changes in the market. We've gone from the use of old agents and the primary focus on palliation, to the adoption of new agents and the primary focus becoming the improvement of patient outcomes. And while that adoption of new agents has been quite rapid, that has been primarily the result of what is happening in the institutional setting, in the hospital setting and within the community, only in those physicians that are more experienced in melanoma and see more patients. But going forward, we see that the percentage of physicians in the community that are continuing to use older agents will shift over time to focus on survival. And when that happens, we will be very well positioned as YERVOY. So we're encouraged with the recent trends and the evolution of the market in the U.S. As a reminder, YERVOY has very strong long term survival data, and that is independent from BRAF status, and it applies broadly to all of the segments of the patient population in metastatic melanoma.\nOperator\nAnd we go next to Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.\nTim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nA couple of questions. On ELIQUIS, assuming you receive full approval at the June PDUFA, how quickly would you be ready to launch? And second question is on the commercial potential of hep C therapies, the patient pool is large, but for most patients, the disease is asymptomatic and even though the cure rates are high, with a largely silent disease like this, I'm wondering if the ramp up may not be quite as high and as fast as some are expecting. And if that's the case, then that kind of race to be first to the market may not be quite as important, and you could end up with a crowded category with a bunch of players where everyone takes a part of the market?\nLamberto Andreotti\nYes, Tim, it's Lamberto. If you can imagine, we are very excited about the opportunity to launch ELIQUIS in atrial fibrillation. We have a differentiated profile for a disease that there's still a very high unmet medical need like atrial fibrillation is. What I would like to add on the line is that, in addition to the great profile of the product, we have 2 strong companies, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, with a strong legacy of success in CV commercialization getting ready for the launch and will behind both companies will behind the launch very effectively. We are preparing for the launch. We have been working with Pfizer to be ready sooner as we can to launch the product. And Giovanni, why don't you give some more color about what we are doing there?\nGiovanni Caforio\nYes, thank you, Lamberto. This is Giovanni. So building on what Lamberto said. Clearly, we are very focused on the profile of ELIQUIS and the differentiated profile of ELIQUIS not only versus warfarin, but also versus the other new agents, because of the benefit in efficacy, bleeding and mortality versus warfarin. Lamberto mentioned our and Pfizer's legacy in CV. In the U.S., we are also are very excited with the fact that we truly have complementary capabilities. We at BMS, for example, develop strong expertise in the hospital setting, Pfizer is very experienced with integrated healthcare systems in the U.S., and they clearly have with us a broad reach in primary care. So we are focusing very actively on preparing for launch, and working together to leverage our complementary capability and experience in this disease area. Regarding launch and uptake, we have learned that establishing early access and reimbursement is very critical to a successful launch. And that will be our focus in the first 4 to 6 weeks after we receive approval. During that period, which will likely be during the summer months, we will also be focusing on training our sales force and medical organizations to begin promoting and supporting the product. Once we begin to promote, we expect that the primary opportunity for ELIQUIS at launch will be to compete for new patient starts and patients who are no longer well-controlled on warfarin. And based on our profile, we plan on working to establish ELIQUIS as the leading new agent for these patients. Over time, as physicians become more comfortable with the profile of ELIQUIS and its overall value, we believe that other patient segments such as those on aspirin or switches from patients that are controlled on warfarin could become significant opportunities. In the long term, the size of the opportunity of ELIQUIS will ultimately be dependent on a number of factors: The incidence of A-fib and how it grows annually; the evolution of the percentage of patients that get treated; the share that new agents capture, and within that, our share with ELIQUIS; and finally duration of therapy. So in summary, we're excited with the profile of the product, with Pfizer as 2 companies which have significant experience in CV, but also complementary capabilities in the U.S. market. We're working very hard to prepare to launch, and we will be ready to execute the commercial launch when we're approved by the FDA.\nJohn Elicker\nAnd Beatrice, did you want to comment on the HCV opportunity?\nBeatrice Cazala\nSo you're asking our views on the commercial opportunities and the way the market could shape up. You heard Lamberto talking about 170 million people worldwide. What's important to realize, it's only 20% of patients that are infected that are currently diagnosed. And only 10%, even less than 10% in some geography are treated. So the magnitude of the opportunity is significant. We know that physician, payers and patients are looking for safer and more tolerable regimen, with better cure rates and with shorter duration of therapy. Once this is available, we believe that there will be a rate of patient coming into the health care system that will need to be treated. So delivering on these advances could drive a strong expansion of the number of treated patient and result in significant commercial potential over time. When we looked at the various criteria for critical success factor, we are well aware, and we are analyzing those and monitoring them regularly. The change that this would create would impact significantly. At the moment, we have very conservative assumption. The potential increase in treatment rate with safer, easier to use, and more effective therapy will be also key. And we don't know yet which products will be there available and in which regimen. The share of patient treated with each regimen, because each regimen will be about efficacy, but it will also be about safety and individual patient tolerability and acceptance of those regimen. The payor response might be very different in different geographies to the development of novel treatment options, the price expectation [ph] and finally, the sequence as you mentioned of competitive launch is something very important. So working on those adds, you heard from Elliott the strength of our portfolio. We believe we will be ready for all scenarios because we have a very complete scope of products, and we mentioned the dias [ph], but we also as you know, have alonda [ph] interferon in development. So we feel that we are very well positioned to succeed adding and monitoring all the criteria for critical success factor in this market.\nOperator\nAnd we go next to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.\nSeamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division\nJust very quickly, can you guys update us on what happens, and if there were any changes quarter-to-quarter with regard to stocking as it relates to ABILIFY and also if there were any trend changes on REYATAZ that you can just update us on quickly? Separately, with regard to the ELIQUIS launch, it sounds like you guys are talking about this as an incident-type patient population. Can you just remind us the size of the global patient population? And how we should be thinking about the sequence of the launch opportunity? It seems like incident patient population opportunities and new patient opportunities rather than switch opportunities have been relatively slow launches. And then the last question is with regard to ELIQUIS, some of the feedback that we continue to get from physicians on a regular basis has been with regard to inertia and part of that is related to the patient and the price of therapy and the cost of therapy associated with that. Obviously, access is a big part of that, but access is also baked to price globally. So maybe you can just talk to us about whether or not you think apixaban warrants a price premium or if you think a price premium is flawed? We've seen a different approach from Regeneron, where they came in at a lower price and have actually generated an absolutely phenomenal launch, at least in the short term.\nLamberto Andreotti\nLet me say the following. Giovanni can you take ABILIFY and REYATAZ, and Beatrice to speak about the global opportunity and some of the access considerations on ELIQUIS. Obviously, we are not going to discuss the price that we are going to charge for ELIQUIS in the future. It's too early, and it is clearly -- we're not going to discuss it today. So Giovanni?\nGiovanni Caforio\nYes. Very quickly on the performance of ABILIFY and REYATAZ starting with ABILIFY. From a DRx perspective in the U.S., we continued to see strong performance for the brand. We grew 4% versus prior year in DRxes, which is significantly higher than the total market. We had some inventory work-down during the quarter, and the change in our agreement with Otsuka, which impacted net sales versus previous. But from a demand perspective, it's a really good picture with 4% DRx growth. REYATAZ, we also did grow 3% in demand versus the same quarter of last year. We continue to be the #1 prescribed PI. There are a lot of new competitors in the market, but we continue to have a very strong position in the marketplace.\nCharles A. Bancroft\nYes. I would just add to that. Recall in my remarks, Seamus, around the tender business, which is quite large in Brazil to the government there. We didn't really have much of a tender in the first quarter this year. As I said, we expect it in Q2. And then last year, we did have the tender. So there was a timing issue there on a global basis for REYATAZ.\nLamberto Andreotti\nBeatrice, on ELIQUIS?\nBeatrice Cazala\nYes, regarding the global opportunity, you were asking the size. I mean, we have to recognize that there is about 10 million people which have today worldwide the A-fib conditions. So representing about 15% to 20% for stroke. So when you look at that, it's clear that there is a significant potential. So you are talking about where are the opportunities mentioning that, obviously, the new patient are easier because you don't have to switch them to get and again [indiscernible] as was already mentioned to you, of what we are going to do in the first stage of the launches. Overall, when we look at the global market, including switch for warfarin, an important part of what we want to achieve. You know that a lot of patient are not well controlled in terms of the INRs with warfarin. So understanding fully what control means over time. It's not going to be easy to convince everybody, but we believe we have a strong data, which will allow us to be able to access both segment of the market, both the naive patient, as well as the warfarin currently only-treated patients. So when you look at the sequences of launches and what could happen on a worldwide basis, it depends on the ability to get first the registration, and we are finding in most of the geography. But also the ability to get access, and I will mention in particular Europe, you mentioned some of the launches there. It's clear that based on what we are hearing as you know, ELIQUIS has been launched in some of the European market today, and we are gaining reimbursement. Relatively, I would say, positively across Europe. I don't know how much. In all the discussion we are having with the authorities on pricing, we feel very encouraged by the dialogues we have talking about our product, its profile, and they're asking us when are we going to come with A-fib. So we see a positive acceptance of our current profile with very important data we have on both ARISTOTLE and AVERROES. You also know that in some geographies, not just warfarin patient, those are important, but there's also aspirin-treated patients. There are many geography where it's aspirin that has been used because they don't and cannot use warfarin. So in those market with our data, we feel again, we have a unique opportunity versus some of our competitors regarding a broad scope of studies, allowing to face the different patient types. With that, you mentioning the speed of penetration, one has to realize that a lot of the patient are coming to the hospital first. And it's half of the population going to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment before going to the cardiologist and the PCP. And because of that, nature of the -- you need a certain time to establish formularies, to follow the patients through the continuum of care, to be able to follow the chain of treatment, all the way to the PCPs. So we have been working, Giovanni mentioning to you, but it in every geography we are looking at that very carefully to optimize our launch penetration.\nLamberto Andreotti\nSo let me add one comment on ELIQUIS. I have very many reasons to be proud of my R&D team. And Elliott and his team have done a great job also on ELIQUIS, and I'm very proud of the fact that this is a global filing. We have filed in the U.S., we have filed in the EU, and we have filed in Japan. So this is really a global successful approach to the development of our product.\nOperator\nAnd we go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nJust a couple of follow-ups on those, and I  appreciate those comments on ELIQUIS. One view that seems to be out there as part of the reason we saw PRADAXA quickly ramp then slow as the product captured a lot of the kind of low-hanging fruit in the market here of \"really difficult to treat\" warfarin patients. How are you kind of factoring that in as you kind of think of it being, while very differentiated product, the third kind of new oral coagulant -- anticoagulant kind of entering here and as you're thinking about the launch trajectory? The second question, you've mentioned again going after aspirin, going after existing warfarin patients, can you just give us a sense of just how long of a timeframe you are thinking here till those become a reality? Is that 1 year or 2? Is that 3 to 5 years? Just trying to kind of frame up how you're thinking about how long that opportunity takes to play out? And then just a final question and shifting back to hep C, markets obviously rapidly evolving, you've got a lot of assets, do you expect once the dust settles though, we're going to see 1 or 2 regimens really dominating globally? Or will this end up being a pretty fragmented market with a lot of different combinations used in different geographies, in different patient genotypes, et cetera? Just any comments there will be appreciated.\nGiovanni Caforio\nYes, this is Giovanni. Let me start in clarifying some of those comments I made earlier on ELIQUIS. You're right. As we think about the source of patients for ELIQUIS at the beginning, we do think that accumulation of early switch patients were probably already picked up by PRADAXA. And so as we think about the opportunity for ELIQUIS, the primary opportunity at the beginning will be to compete for new patient starts, and that's where our strong profile will be helpful there, and we will be focusing on that as a primary area of focus at the beginning. We did describe a sequence of opportunities in different segments of the market becoming available over time. That will take time. And it will be different one country and one market from the other, but we do see those segments becoming available over time, and our strategy will be to really think about the sequential approach.\nElliott Sigal\nYes, Chris, with regard to the hepatitis C market, I think at this time it's prudent for a company to envision some segmentation geographically. And our strategy is based on that. For example, in Japan, I see -- since the genotype of the virus is predominantly 1b, and we have very high cure rates in Phase II with the protease and the 5A, that oral regimen, I think, looks like it could have a very, very important contribution and hard to improve upon perhaps. And in the developing countries, specially with a predominance of the host genotype leading to a very good response of interferon-based regimen, and the access pressures being such that a lot of the new oral medicines may not be as attractive over there, we have a strategy based on improved interferon that will improve the number of patients and be a very good value to enable access without a very complicated or expensive regimen. With regard to the rest of the world, especially U.S. and Europe, I think we're off to the start of simplicity of perhaps 2 agents, and the question's whether it will be 12 weeks or 24 weeks. And then what to do with the smaller percentage of patients that don't respond to regimens. And our program, as you see, is directed in those large segments.\nOperator\nAnd we go next to Mark Schoenebaum with the ISI Group.\nMark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division\nI thought perhaps I'd address these for Elliott, if it's appropriate. Noticed you partnered with Medavir and Tibotec on their protease inhibitor. Are you interested in a partnership with Gilead or would you rather go it alone? The second question is some companies in the hep C space have said -- have made statements that the FDA might allow them to move into a Phase III trial, combining novel oral agents without a significant Phase II experience. Is that consistent or inconsistent with the feedback that you've gotten? And then finally, on your NS5A, Elliott, you mentioned you think it's best-in-class. I was wondering if you could help us understand what the attributes are for your 5A that may be better than the other ones out there?\nElliott Sigal\nSo taking some of these questions in the reverse order. What we look for, we've had a lot of experience with NS5A, and we have a whole series of backups and improvements should they be needed. And a lot of experience of how the different molecules perform. The 3 criteria we look at, of course, are the PK to make sure that at reasonable doses, you're getting appropriate drug levels. We look at resistance profile, whether one mutant or multiple mutants are required to escape the regimens drugs. And we look at potency across different genotypes. And in those 3 categories, I'm quite pleased to-date, but never complacent for tomorrow with regard to where our 5A is. And I think, I would not make assumptions that all compounds are the same. I don't think we've ever done that in pharmaceutical development. Chemical changes and dose changes and resistance changes, ask new questions that have to be answered typically in a good Phase II study. So that's the assumption we have made. That's the feedback we get, although, with our experience, there are a lot of ways for us to have very, very competitive timelines. Well, you asked specifically about Gilead. We've offered for a matter of months a pure and simple clinical collaboration to get these 2 lead compounds together in Phase III data that would benefit patients, instruct physicians, when both compounds come to market. So because that regimen can be, I think, in a significant lead position in the field and make a major contribution. I think it's good for patients. That's our business model. It's very good for us. If it's determined to be good for Gilead, we're open to the collaboration.\nOperator\nAnd we go next to Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nGregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nI'll start with Elliott on dapa. Do you have any sense at all what the FDA bar is based on the interactions you've had with them or do you need an official meeting for that? And then a bigger picture question for the team, from an M&A perspective, is the company open to acquisitions that enhance existing commercial franchises, but then don't have much of a pipeline elements? Or you can just answer the question that you think I'm probably asking.\nJohn Elicker\nWell, let me just take that one first, Greg. It's John. We're not going to comment on any rumors or speculation. Charlie can comment in a minute about our capital allocation priorities, but Elliott do you want comment on dapa?\nElliott Sigal\nYes, I'm not sure yet because the complete discussions have not occurred with regard to the FDA. Of course, we are very pleased to have received a positive opinion from the CHMP on April 19, and expect that will be followed by European approval. I took note of their comments, of their concern about the increasing prevalence of the disease, the progressive nature of the disease, the need for combination therapy. And the note -- as we note, that other drugs that are out there have side effects. And therefore, their determination of the benefit risk was in keeping with the way we saw the clinical data. And while we are working on our approvals around the world, we will be meeting with the FDA soon to discuss a path forward. And we hope that a similar recognition of the unmet medical need will guide our discussions with the agency.\nCharles A. Bancroft\nLet me just briefly touch on BD. I would say in summary, nothing has changed regarding our overall BD strategy. As we've said many times, business development is one of our top priorities as evidenced by our recently completed acquisition of Inhibitex. And even with that transaction, we continue to view business development as a key priority within the framework of a balanced capital allocation approach. We continue to be interested in small molecules, as well as expanding our biologics capabilities that are aligned with our key therapeutic areas. And we will continue to look for BD opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth. And we are also interested in near-term opportunities that would improve the overall growth profile of our company. And of course, we will remain disciplined with regard to focusing on transactions that are strategically, scientifically and economically sound.\nOperator\nAnd we go next to Marc Goodman with UBS.\nMarc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nFirst, can you give us an update just on SPRYCEL and the share that's going on and how much are you taking there? First line versus second line and how that's moving? And second on ORENCIA, can you talk about just how much of the sales are subcu right now? What percent of shipments? Just give us some sense of what's going on and your share of that marketplace?\nLamberto Andreotti\nSPRYCEL, progress -- significant progress in establishing it as important medicine in CML. In the very competitive market, we grew the business by 51 -- 52%, in fact, in the U.S. and 27% in international markets compared to Q1 of last year. In the U.S., we saw growth, driven by both continued adoption in the first-line setting and our continued leading share in the second-line segment. Outside of the U.S., I'm very pleased by the strong adoption of SPRYCEL in first line in Japan. And our European business continues to do well now that we have first-line reimbursement in many countries that include Germany, Italy and Spain. Do you want to add something Giovanni? And maybe you can also continue on ORENCIA.\nGiovanni Caforio\nThis is Giovanni. Just to add on what Lamberto said, we had very strong performance in the U.S. with SPRYCEL similar to what happened in other parts of the world. We grew over 50% versus prior year, and 8% versus prior quarter, driven by demand, primarily. We continue to see the GLEEVEC business slowly eroding. There are approximately slightly under 76% of patients in the U.S. now still on GLEEVEC, but we continue to make inroads in both first and second line in both segments of the market. In first-line, we're slightly ahead of the TASIGNA. In the second-line setting, we're capturing about 58% of that opportunity. So the SPRYCEL business continues to grow very nicely. On ORENCIA, we also had in the U.S. a strong quarter versus last year. We had over 20% growth in sales versus last year. And let me make you a couple of comments and describe how we are doing in the IV segment, which to-date has been our core business, and then what is happening with the launch of subcu. So we have strong performance in IV. We grew volume by 4% versus last year. The total IV market grew less than 1%. Our current share in patients in IV is about 24%, and we are capturing approximately 30% of the new patient opportunities. In Q1 versus Q4, our IV business was stable, which we consider to be very important. Since October, we've been focusing on the launch of ORENCIA subcu and that launch is going well. In the first part of the launch, we focused on access and reimbursement, and approximately at the end of Q1, approximately 80% of commercial lives are covered, and we have open access in more than 60% of that market. We've seen good uptake in demand for subcu in the first quarter. Our sales were $31 million, which also included $2 million of inventory work-down. And what we've seen is a couple of things. First of all, the base of prescribers and trials has grown very, very nicely. And the majority of the prescribers are not heavy prescribers of ORENCIA IV. So they're new prescribers for us. And second, over 80% of the business we've captured so far has actually been new business that has not been the result of cannibalization of existing IV business. And so this is very consistent with our objective of leveraging the launch of ORENCIA subcu to establish a strong presence in the 60% of the market, which is subcu.\nElliott Sigal\nAnd Giovanni, I'll follow with a brief research update that following the approval last year in the U.S., we've submitted in Europe the subcu application, and we're pleased to be presenting at EULAR. I think one of the first comparative studies of its kind head-to-head with ORENCIA subcu and HUMIRA. And that will be in early June.\nOperator\nAnd we will go next to John Boris with Citi.\nJohn T. Boris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division\nOne on ELIQUIS, do you have launch quantities built since there's only a couple of months here before FDA action, and then have you completed label negotiations with the FDA on ELIQUIS? And if so, have you done any market research testing with that label and what are the top attributes at least that would cause physicians to want to pen a prescription for that of ELIQUIS? And then I have a follow-up for Elliott on hep C.\nElliott Sigal\nWith regard to ELIQUIS, both sides are heavily engaged in this very extensive file. We don't comment on the details until the FDA is completed. The label is one of the last things completed, but I am pleased with the progress and confident in the presentation of the data that I expect to be in the label.\nJohn Elicker\nAnd then in terms of launch quantity, Lamberto?\nLamberto Andreotti\nSorry, I didn't understand I was supposed to give this answer, but we are in shape. Yes, of course, yes.\nJohn Elicker\nJohn, we may have lost you for your follow-up on hep C, so please give us a call once the call is over.\nOperator\nAnd we go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nI dialed in a little bit late, so I apologize if I'm repeating anything, but Elliott, I was hoping that you could just talk about your process of figuring out the right dose for the nuc, plus NS5A used in Phase III. Specifically, I know that there is an 90-patient study #094 in combination with PEG interferon and ribavirin. But I'm just not sure if that will help you understand the toxicity better. And specifically, how that will inform the decision on a different combination for Phase III. So if you could just talk about the process and the additional data that you'll be looking at to help you decide by the end of the year the right dose for Phase III that would be helpful. And then the second question on that is, do you still plan to do Phase III, plus or minus ribavirin? And then the final question is a commercial question, and I apologize if this was addressed, but obviously, YERVOY did not grow sequentially in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter in the United States as expected given the BRAF introduction. Just wanted to get your sense for when you would expect YERVOY in the U.S. to start growing against sequentially?\nLamberto Andreotti\nDavid, you might have called a little bit later, so I suggest that the information about YERVOY that Giovanni gave before, and I'll repeat it now. But the good thing is that, as we said, and Giovanni confirmed. the trend of prescriptions is positive in the last few weeks.\nElliott Sigal\nAnd I can give a quick answer to what we were discussing before, David. That the current Phase II you referred to of 90 patients, we believe will contribute, important to our safety database. But we are designing for starting this year a Phase IIb of daclatasvir in combination with a variety of doses of our nuc. And the result of that Phase IIb will define the dose and regimen with or without ribavirin for our Phase III next year.\nLamberto Andreotti\nSo thank you for your many and good questions. Summary, good quarter. We are working hard on delivering both our short term and long-term objectives, and we are excited about this transition to new post-AVAPRO, post-PLAVIX era that we have initiated. Thank you.\nJohn Elicker\nThanks, everybody. That concludes our call.\nOperator\nAnd again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.\n\n",

First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release. (Operator Instructions)\nI\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, News Corporation. Please go ahead. Reed Nolte\nThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2011 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Dave DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer. Rupert Murdoch will not be joining us today as he\u2019s been traveling overseas.\nFirst, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. First from the financial community and then from the press. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation\u2019s Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2010, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. And these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found on our earnings release in our 10-Q filing.\nAnd with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave. David DeVoe\nReed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today\u2019s earnings release, we are very pleased with our start of fiscal 2011. Our first quarter segment operating income increased 8% over a year-ago levels, led by the continuing strong growth at our Cable Programming, Television and Publishing segments that more than offset difficult comparisons at Filmed Entertainment.\nNet income for the quarter was $775 million, a 36% increase over the year ago results. Earnings per share also increased 36% to $0.30 this year from $0.22 reported a year ago. This strong net earnings growth was driven by the higher segment operating income, as well as improved earnings from affiliates, primarily at BSkyB led by gain from the sale of their Easynet business. Also included in this year\u2019s first quarter result is a tax benefit of approximately $90 million or $0.03 per share related to the resolution of various tax items. You will note that affected this quarter, we have combined the previously reported Book Publishing, Integrated Marketing Services and Newspaper Information Service segments into a Publishing segment. This reporting change recognizes both the way we group these businesses and a smaller percentage of total earnings that these businesses now represent. Now, I\u2019d like to provide some additional context on the performance of the two of our businesses. Let\u2019s start with the Cable Networks, which is our largest profit generator and accounted for over 57% of News Corp.\u2019s total segment operating income this quarter. This segment continues to drive overall company results, with first quarter segment operating income contribution of $659 million, this up 28% from last year and reflects double-digit growth of the majority of our channels. This growth continues to be top line driven, with segment revenues up 17%. Advertising revenues at the Cable Networks increased 20% over year-ago levels and affiliate fees grew 40%, reflecting particularly for strength at the Regional Sports Networks, FOX News and our international channels. The strength of our Cable Network franchise continues to grow. As Fox News in October, we drew more viewers than all of our news competitors combined. FX recently ranked as the number seven most popular cable channel among adults, 18 to 49. Ratings at the Big 10 networks have been setting records and our fastest earnings grower, the international channels including the Star, Fox and National Georgraphic-branded channels continue to expand and capitalize on particularly strong advertising markets, especially in India. At our Film segment, first quarter operating income was $280 million, a good result but as expected, well below the $391 million we reported a year ago. As we mentioned on the last quarter\u2019s earnings call, this anticipated decline reflects the very successful worldwide theatrical release of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in the prior year\u2019s result.\nContributions from our television production businesses were up year-over-year, primarily reflecting the initial syndication release of two major shows, How I Met Your Mother and American Dad. At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $105 million increased by $67 million. This improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our television stations, partially offset by modestly higher losses at the broadcast network from program cancellation costs.\nStation advertising revenues were up 22% in the quarter compared to a year ago; reflecting improved local advertising trends, particularly in the automotive, telecom and financial categories.\nPolitical revenues of $26 million were strong in the quarter and stayed healthy through yesterday\u2019s election. Turning to SKY Italia. Revenues increased 2% in local currency terms, as compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter, primarily driven by the subscriber upgrade tickets and advertising for the World Cup coverage. SKY Italia generated segment operating income of $82 million, which is down from last year\u2019s $128 million result. This result primarily reflects right\u2019s cost associated with full coverage of the World Cup and increase subscriber acquisition costs related to the combination of both higher gross additions and the higher takeout of our full installation offer. As mentioned on our last earnings conference call, SKY Italia\u2019s consumer offering was reorganized in July, more than doubling subscribers programming package choices. These new offerings also make the high end\u2019s standard service to our subscribers. Results to date indicate that this increased consumer choice is stimulating subscriber growth, giving us increased confidence that we will hit our profit growth in subscriber targets this year. In the quarter, higher gross additions totaling 193,000 and lower churn net of SKY Italia of 58,000 additional subscribers. Now, this compares to no subscriber growth in the first quarter a year ago. Sky ended the quarter with 4.8 million subscribers. The penetration of additional subscriber services such as high-def PVRs and second boxes which helped reduced churn doubled over the last year with approximately 70% for our subscriber base taking at least one of those services.\nMulti-ARPU in the quarter average EUR43 as compared to EUR42 last year. In our newly defined Publishing segment, segment operating income of $178 million increased over 50% from the $118 million in last year\u2019s first quarter. This improvement is primarily due to increased advertising revenues in all three of our major market newspapers. Also note that this improvement is despite the absence of Dow Jones Index business, which was sold last March. The year-ago results included about $40 million in segment operating profit from the Index business. And that our other segment, we reported the first quarter segment loss of $156 million, this is $30 million higher than a year ago. This increased loss primarily reflects $70 million in lower search and advertising revenues at MySpace versus a year ago. And finally, before I turn the call over to Chase, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2011. And as a reminder, just as we did at the year end, we measured this guidance excluding from fiscal 2010 the $500 million [inaudible] litigation charge, resulting in phase of $4.46 billion segment operating income for comparative purposes. In early August, we gave guidance in our segment operating income growth rate in fiscal 2011 to be in the low double-digit range above the $4.46 billion fiscal 2010 adjusted results. Since that time, the U.S. dollar has weakened more than we expected thereby, increasing our foreign source earnings. On the other hand, results at MySpace have been below planned, we\u2019ve had to absorb because of cable carriage negotiation and our new film releases was somewhat below our original expectations. As a result, taking all these items into account and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are maintaining our operating segment income guidance for fiscal 2011 to a growth rate range in low-double digits above fiscal 2010 adjusted results. And with all that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Chase. Chase Carey\nThanks. As Dave has summarized the financials pretty well for you, I thought I\u2019d spend a few minutes adding a bit of color commentary to the results. While we feel good about our performance, we feel even better about the strides we\u2019re making, to strengthen our business and position them for long-term growth. Clearly as Dave said, our Network business both broadcast and cable is the lead segment empowering this growth. It\u2019s understatement to say there\u2019s a lot of focus on our retransmission agreements in the last few weeks. These deals are critical to driving the Fox Networks\u2019 financial success to reflect its real value. Today, we have agreements in place with four of the largest distributors and have now set the market for our Broadcast business. Over the next couple of years, as we continue to close new agreements, we will be taking this business to a whole new level of profitability.\nHowever, the growth of our network is equally driven by a great and growing set of cable channels. From the incredible strength of FOX News to FX original series like Sons of Anarchy and The League, the National Georgraphic event programming like Great Migrations to emerging sports network like Fox Soccer and Fuel, our U.S. Channels business continues to grow. The success of these channels has enabled us to continue to add subscribers, to earn fees that reflect the increased importance of our networks to customers and it could drive great advertising growth. Our Networks business outside the U.S. has been even more dynamic growth story as we take advantage of our leadership position in the emerging and growing international pay-TV market. This growth story continues to be big and broad. For example, a geographic region like Asia, which have previously not been a significant contributor as others, has really stepped up in the last quarter, plus. At a local level, our TV stations continue to do a great job about taking market share and driving efficiencies. And all our Local, National and International TV businesses are continuing to benefit from a very strong advertising market. Our stations are looking at 20% year-on-year growth in the December quarter, while network scatter continues to be priced at double-digit increases to the upfront.\nSo, the broader economy still faces great uncertainty. There are no signs that these anxieties are impacting the ad market as we begin to look beyond January 1. Nonetheless, we remain cautious and alert for the risks. Our Networks business is our biggest. We had key initiatives underway across the company. In Italy, we\u2019ve began to recapture some of the growth that we had before the challenges with [inaudible] during the past 12 months, plus. Our short-term priority has been top line growth, particularly subscribers. And we\u2019ve begun to achieve those objectives through new pricing and packaging, technology, leadership and re-energized marketing. We\u2019re certainly not declaring victory, but I believe we\u2019re making the right moves and making headway. Germany is even more of a work in progress. However, there, again, I believe our management team is making the right moves and beginning to get things going in the right direction. We clearly have challenges ahead, but the market opportunity is unique and we have a real combination of content and technology leadership to build on. At our Content businesses, Fox Film has had a disappointing few quarters without breakout hits. But is important to note, we have avoided any big loss films and the industry noted for them. We continue to be led by a management team that is second to none and one that knows how to manage this complicated business. We feel great about our big holiday releases and in the next year.\nIn addition, we\u2019re strengthening our business for the long-term by reaching agreements with James Cameron, the next two Avatar films and concluding an extension to our film financing structure. Our TV production business continues to prove its strength with a series like Modern Family, which is well in its way to the highest first cycle per episode syndication cable revenues ever. From a Fox Network perspective, the new season has been a bit of a disappointment and we would like to have a gain six in the World Series, but the strength of the NFL and the ad market has enabled us to largely offset those shortfalls. More importantly, we\u2019re very excited about the new energy at American Idol and the continued progress on X Factor for next fall, with the potential to build real year-round tent poles. In our publishing business, we continue to build on our leadership position and traditional print, with papers like the Wall Street Journal continuing to grow while others decline. At the same time, we\u2019re building a digital business for our news content that has a healthy and exciting future. These digital businesses will take time to emerge and the explosion of tables the next few years will be a real driving force. We feel very good about the launch of our digital subscription product in the U.K. and believe it\u2019s a great foundation to build on. The final business I want to touch on is MySpace. We\u2019ve been clear that MySpace is a problem. We recognize that we had to redefine and largely rebuild this business. We believe the foundation that to warrant this effort and it has been our focus this year. We\u2019ve made adjustments in the cost structure most recently by consolidating ad sales. And most importantly, in the last few weeks, we have relaunched MySpace with a focus on social entertainment.\nWe feel really good about this relaunched product and it has been generally well received by the opinion makers in the business, but we recognized a critical issue is building interest with consumers. We also recognize the challenges we face in doing so. The current losses are not acceptable or sustainable.\nOur current management did not create these losses, but they know we have to address them. I give them great credit for pouring their hearts and sweat into creating a new great MySpace experience that has the potential to be an exciting business for us. We equally know we need to make real headway in the coming quarters to get this business to a sustainable level. Overall, when you have as many businesses and as many regions as we do, it\u2019s unlikely that they will all be operating at an optimum level on a short-term basis, although we strive to make sure most are. I believe our core job is to make sure we have great management teams running these businesses, that we take advantage of opportunities, aggressively address problems and have plans in place to build long-term value in our increasingly complicated digital world. We believe we\u2019re achieving these goals. Thanks, and I\u2019ll turn it back to Dave and Reed and we\u2019re happy to take questions. Reed Nolte\nOperator, if we could take questions from the financial community please.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nOkay. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Michael Nathanson, Nomura. Michael Nathanson \u2013 Nomura\nHey, thanks. I have one for Chase for MySpace. You mentioned the relaunch, I wondered how much time needs to pass before you judge whether or not it\u2019s successful? And how you judge whether or not it\u2019s successful, what are you looking for? And if it doesn\u2019t work, what happens next? So, that\u2019s one look at.Chase Carey\nI\u2019m not going to put a specific date. These are fluid businesses. But I think this is something we looked up, judging quarters not in years. And I think our goal is to get to a place, essentially probably that has got a revenue, the top line that is going in the right direction, and a clear path to profitability. And I think those are the goals we\u2019ve set for that business.\nAnd I think the product we launch, we feel really good about. We recognize, we have to build an audience, we\u2019ve got an audience, we\u2019ve got still great reach that gives us the foundation to bring an audience to that products. But our traffic number is still not going in the right direction, and we have to stabilized that and have a predictable path forward. And make sure we got the right cost structure. And again, a clear path to be a profitable business. \nMichael Nathanson \u2013 Nomura\nOkay, thanks.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente, Barclays Capital. Please, go ahead.Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital\nJust one question for Chase. Had a question around your philosophy around making Fox TV\u2019s to your content available on digital platforms. It seems as though to me, you\u2019ve been a bit more liberal in terms of the Fox content that\u2019s available on Hulu, Fox.com. You mentioned Modern Family in your opening comments and I guess you\u2019ve licensed the digital rights to ABC because you can watch the most recent episode of Modern Family on ABC.com.\nSo, I\u2019m just wondering how that strategy is going, if you can give us an update on your thoughts there? And if you plan to continue along a more open path in terms of Fox content online? Thanks.Chase Carey\nGreat. And I guess first, I just clarify there that shows like Modern Family there are probably more ABC decisions based on rights or license. I\u2019ll talk about our shows, but probably decisions you\u2019re citing on things like Modern Family are more driven by ABC as the network, the licenses, the network rights. I mean I guess what I say, as a broad-based statement, as I think this digital arena is clearly still evolving, I think it is important that \u2013 we\u2019re very focus on essentially, how do you manage this rights and really, there are a handful of key issues. What are the windows, what\u2019s the ad load and what\u2019s the pricing to the degree that you\u2019re dealing with some form of payment structure? Obviously it\u2019s what the products that goes in it.\nI think all those things are things we\u2019re evaluating. Obviously, in places like Hulu we\u2019ve talked about a subscription service to go with the pay service. I think as we go forward with our traditional distribution partners, it\u2019s important we deal with these issues, constructively.\nWe think the digital arena is a very important one. I think particularly the mobile platforms. I do think the iPad brings a whole new dimension of opportunities to the digital arena. But look scarcity of our products is a tremendous value. I think we need to make sure we\u2019ve manage that product. We managed its availability intelligently. And I think that is very been much a work in progress and I certainly wouldn\u2019t say today. If we\u2019ve got a set of rules in place that we\u2019re looking to as long-term goals, I think we learn as we go. And I think those practices will continue to evolve.\nAnd I do think it\u2019s important that the digital platforms continue to develop dual revenue stream options. I mean I do think in fragmenting world, it\u2019s difficult to rely solely on the advertising supported platforms. And I do think dual revenue streams are critical and those options, the digital world, clearly or even earlier stage than others. So I think this arena will evolve. I think you\u2019ll see how we manage content in that context. Continue to evolve as these various business models evolve. \nAnthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital\nOkay, thanks, Chase.\nReed Nolte\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nAnd that comes from David Bank, RBC Markets. Please, go ahead.David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets\nThanks, guys. Kind of a follow-up on the first question on the MySpace side, thank you for the color. But there are a lot of kind of other operations in there within other and I was wondering if you could give some more color in terms of whether or not you saw room for operating improvement and what the order of magnitude could be for things like mobile or the Fox and network or kind of the refresher on what\u2019s in there, what\u2019s working, what can be working better and what the order of magnitude of improvement could be in the intermediate term? David DeVoe\nYes. The businesses that are within other, there\u2019s only two other businesses. Fox Mobile and it\u2019s our news outdoor business. All right \u2026\nChase Carey\nAnd IGN.\nDavid DeVoe\nAnd IGN, related to MySpace, I would say there\u2019s not substantial room for growth within those businesses. David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets\nOkay. So, it\u2019s pretty much just MySpace and that\u2019s the opportunity for improvement? David DeVoe\nThat\u2019s correct. \nDavid Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets\nOkay, thank you very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi, Standard & Poor\u2019s. Tuna Amobi \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s\nThank you very much. My question is on Avatar, so you decided to go with two more installments on that and it seems like you say just put together the financing on that. I\u2019m trying to get a sense on how you kind of frame the upside from this franchise? And it seems like you having a three-disc set out this November. And I believe you had a modestly successful re-release of the title.\nSo, as you think about this franchise going forward, can you help us perhaps understand how the potential upsides as you see it? I know you spent a significant amount on the marketing for the first installment, which obviously was paid off. So, I\u2019m just trying to \u2013 if you were to look out next two, three years, how would you \u2013 how can we kind of think about this franchise and the potential strategy which you intend to use to monetize that? Chase Carey\nWell, I mean if you \u2013 I think with the sequel, it\u2019s been a whole different level. I mean sequels to the most successful film ever by practically a factor of two. If you\u2019re asking, it\u2019s got two sequels, you can look at that. So, there are a couple years \u2013 there are a few there\u2019s down the road. But those are obviously enormous events and that is a film without comparison or rival. An incredibly successful film, and obviously, an incredibly important franchise for us.\nI mean it\u2019s really more than film in many ways this is up, it is a franchise for us to develop and I think one of the great opportunities you get with these sequels is what the lead time and knowing the product you\u2019ve got, it enables you to develop a lot more things around it. Whether it\u2019s merchandise, licensing, gains, a whole experience that sort of leads into this now that you\u2019ll have the anticipation coming towards it. So, it is \u2013 you really do need to think about it as a franchise that \u2013 I think it\u2019s hard those, two sequels movies coming.\nIn the short term, and they\u2019re certainly important, we\u2019re excited about the home video product we\u2019ve got at Christmas. We still haven\u2019t exploited really the 3D, home entertainment experience because the 3D market is still in its infancy, so that opportunity is down the road, particularly is. I mean this is a franchise without comparison that we need to continue to make sure we in every way possible and I do think the digital world opens up in array of this front [inaudible] develop \u2026\nTuna Amobi \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s\nJust a quick follow-up, Chase. Without going into more detail on it on the deal with James Cameron, would you say the terms are roughly bad or worse, or the same for the coming installment? Chase Carey\nI\u2019m not going to \u2013 we don\u2019t get into terms I mean on the terms we have with key talent. We\u2019re very happy with them. We\u2019re thrilled to have the pictures. We\u2019re thrilled to be working with Jim\nTuna Amobi \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s\nThank you.\nChase Carey\nAn easy to talent [ph] and these are great franchises for us.\nReed Nolte\nThank you, next question, please.\nOperator\nIt comes from Richard Greenfield, BTIG. Richard Greenfield \u2013 BTIG\nHi, two questions. One, on retransmission consent. Cable has been put out of press release when the signaled got restored the other day, basically saying that they had actually gotten better terms by basically removing programming for a couple of weeks or loosing access to programming for a couple of weeks. And we\u2019re just curious, how do you react to that? And two, if that were actually true, does that mean we\u2019re going to see a lot more of these protracted battles with loss programming because there actually is a benefit to the distributor by going to that level?\nAnd then two, could you just update on the BSkyB transactions sort of you filed today. And just wondering what you\u2019re expecting now versus kind of the original time frame that you laid out back when your original deal was announced and on what you\u2019re thinking in terms of best-case, worst-case and approval process? Chase Carey\nActually I didn\u2019t see. I mean what I \u2013 the stuff I saw from Cable division was more sort of essentially complaining that the government didn\u2019t get involved. So, I mean I guess I\u2019m not sure. We were pretty clear with what we\u2019re trying to get and I\u2019m not going to sort of go through what were private negotiations public. But we feel good about where we are. I think we\u2019re pretty clear about what they were trying to do and that was dragging the government into it. We did not \u2013 we don\u2019t think the government needed to be into it.\nIn reality, I think it would have been helpful if the government said upfront, they weren\u2019t. They made up few noises that probably made the process more difficult or is there to make more extracted. I mean I think, protracted. I mean I think if the government have been clear upfront, they were going to stay out of it. It was private matter between private parties; it may have not gone off the air at all. But they got what they were trying to do is pretty clear all along is drag government.\nAnd I think it became clear that government while their array of parties putting out releases, that this is a battle to be dealt with between private parties. And we reached an agreement that we feel very good about.\nRichard Greenfield \u2013 BTIG\nThank you.\nChase Carey\nAnd on BSkyB, no, I mean we filed today. I mean other than what I think is out public, I\u2019m not sure this is a whole lot. I think that the E.U. has said that they\u2019ll answer by some date, nearly this early December.\nDavid DeVoe\nDecember the 8th.\nChase Carey\nAnd I think the U.K. has said they\u2019ll position earlier or something. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a whole lot more color than that. \nRichard Greenfield \u2013 BTIG\nOkay, thanks.\nReed Nolte\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nNext question comes from Jolanta Masojada, Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead.Jolanta Masojada \u2013 Credit Suisse\nDave, I just wondered if you could talk about the appetizer assumptions that underpin your full year guidance. And given the strong trends for the fourth quarter, have those underlying assumptions changed since the guidance you gave back in August? David DeVoe\nNo, those guidance \u2013 the advertising guidance that remain in effect the one we told you in August. Jolanta Masojada \u2013 Credit Suisse\nAnd the underlying sense your saying you\u2019re your expectation for full year haven\u2019t changed despite the very strong first quarter trends?\nDavid DeVoe\nThat\u2019s correct. \nJolanta Masojada \u2013 Credit Suisse\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore. Please, go ahead.Alan Gould \u2013 Evercore\nThank you. Chase, last year, your cable network margins increased about 500 basis points over the prior year. At this first quarter, they\u2019re up another 400 to 500 basis points. Is this first quarter margin of 35.2% something that could be representative for the year? And how long can you, I realize your margins are lower than a lot of your competitors, but how long can you keep growing the margins at this kind of a rate? Chase Carey\nWell, we clearly believe we have room in our array of fronts to continue to drive this number of our channels. I mean I guess in many ways. There are channels aren\u2019t fully distributed that we are continuing to add distribution. Obviously, when we add subscribers to the channel, it\u2019s pretty, it\u2019s pure bottom line.\nA number of the recent deals even including big channels expanded that distribution. The quality of the channels and then you get something like FOX News as it continues to drive forward in the next year or plus. We have been to a new roundup, renewals on FOX News. Again, it sort of the upfront comments.\nIt\u2019s really three things that really all improved those margins. Sort of again, additional \u2013 I mean I\u2019m talking about domestic now, additional subscribers, getting affiliate rates that reflect the value of the channels. And the audience that comes with it in terms of the advertising. Probably even more so domestic, I mean internationally because in internationally, you\u2019ve got channels that expand that reached at an even things like subscriber growth or an even faster rate when you look at places like Latin America and the rate of growth there.\nSo, I think we clearly have real room to grow and as we\u2019ve said competitively, when you look at our channels against those we compete with, they are much less mature channels. They have not been around as long and therefore, the positive things of being they\u2019ve got \u2013 I think disproportionately more growth ahead of them. And [inaudible] channels continue really operate well. And again, whether it\u2019s news or FX or its originals, channels that really perform well. And we feel very good about the ability to drive those business forward Alan Gould \u2013 Evercore\nAs a follow on the industry showed in the second quarter down domestic, down multi-channel homes. Are you seeing that in any of the feature generated from any of your fully distributed channels, are you seeing fully generated channels? Are you seeing fewer subs in the prior quarter? Chase Carey\nNo, and in fact I think we\u2019d looking at subs going up. But I think awful lot was read into that. I don\u2019t \u2013 I mean if you\u2019re good at this court-cutting issue, I just don\u2019t see it. I mean, realistically, I mean it\u2019s the second or third quarter, the mature market were probably a little tougher quarters, but cable down a bit. And satellite and telco is still up. And I guess still the good fundamental service that for American households is a fundamental part of what they do with their time and what they value in their life and I think it\u2019s a service without comparison. For that, we would not be seeing that. \nAlan Gould \u2013 Evercore\nThank you.\nReed Nolte\nThank you. Next question, please.\nOperator\nAnd that comes from the line of James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.James Mitchell \u2013 Goldman Sachs\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking the question. Chase, I think you mentioned last quarter that you were seeking sustained affiliate fee increases from the Regional Sports Networks. Can you talk about your progress on the RFM front, ideally with reference to the recent renewal with Dish? Chase Carey\nWe\u2019re not going into specifics in terms of terms with any one party or really terms in general. I guess what I\u2019d say is the RSNs continues to be a really good business for us. I think they as well as our other cable channels were achieving their objectives and continuing to drive those businesses forward. \nJames Mitchell \u2013 Goldman Sachs\nThank you.\nReed Nolte\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Adam Alexander, Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.\nAdam Alexander \u2013 Goldman Sachs\nGood afternoon. Just a question for Chase on the international channels. It looks to be a very strong result in that division. Can you just break out a little bit or more specifically where that growth is coming from? Is it ad market, affiliate fee or new channel launches, and how much is Wiki [ph] with dollar benefiting that division? Chase Carey\nThe dollar helps some but that\u2019s not the driving force. I mean if I use the phrase big and broad I think in the opening comments and that\u2019s what it is. I mean its multiregional, multi-channel. There\u2019s Latin America, Europe; I cited Asia. I mean on Asia, I\u2019m actually excluding India, so it\u2019s not talking about STAR, which is equally has been good. But it\u2019s a good story.\nThe ad dollars are equally. The ad dollars I think in the mid-20s year-on-year, increases. But those channels, they continue to \u2013 that\u2019s it core TV [ph] really is good in strengthening channels. And I think you got to have quality to deliver. But it is a broad regional story, and the multi-channel story that has both affiliate and the dollar strength behind it.James Mitchell \u2013 Goldman Sachs\nDo you think that businesses are ahead of what you probably would have expected 12 months ago? Chase Carey\nYes, I mean they probably to their credit. Again, I guess in many or four quarters, but I think they\u2019ve beaten every quarter, they\u2019ve beaten the target I gave them. So, yes, they\u2019ve done a really a good job. As the STAR guys, really I mean the STAR guys is the same thing. I mean it\u2019s not just in a random way. Like I think \u2013 and I do think it\u2019s not just saying it\u2019s a market. I mean I think they\u2019re doing a really good job executing and creating quality channels that stand out and have a real value. When you look at the marketer of our channels combined in some of these places, Latin America, Europe it\u2019s extraordinary. And I think we have a real position of leadership that we can really deal on. \nJames Mitchell \u2013 Goldman Sachs\nGreat. Thank you.\nReed Nolte\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Jason Bazinet, Citi. Please, go ahead.Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citi\nThanks. I just had two housekeeping questions. If I\u2019m doing the math right, is the sale of Easynet at BSkyB, did impact your earnings about $0.02? And did the favorable FX helped your operating income growth about two percentage points in the quarter, if you could just confirm? David DeVoe\nNo, Jason, it\u2019s about $0.01 a share on Easynet.\nJason Bazinet \u2013 Citi\nOkay.\nDavid DeVoe\nAnd the currency in the quarter is really, it\u2019s marginal. \nJason Bazinet \u2013 Citi\nOkay, okay. Thank you.\nReed Nolte\nThank you. Next question, please.\nOperator\nAnd that comes from Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nThanks. Good afternoon. Chase, I wanted to go back to the network you talked about retransmission revenue, which clearly News Corp. has led the charge on and gone the math for. But I was wondering on the cost side, as you look at the network, and particularly sports, how you thinking about this business over the long term? I think Fox, I believe probably spends more on sports programming than any other network.\nYou\u2019ve got, in addition to the NFL, baseball, NASCAR, is there something you think needs to change over the long term, do you think the retrans revenue stream fixes the business given how much worth costs or you want to see that will do more and more your cable properties where you build out is the Regional Sports Networks this is that\u2019s very attractive we. Chase Carey\nWell, first, I mean and I guess on the last point, I\u2019m really thinking about our broadcast network, more and more should be thought on the same way as cable network. And therefore, I don\u2019t know that you\u2019re differentiating one from the other. They got to become dual revenue businesses that receive revenues that are reflective of their strength, that\u2019s what we\u2019re driving the Fox network to be is a business that looks essentially much more like our cable networks.\nI guess in the sport point, the sports programming is always a double-edged sword. It has great strength, great value. Look at the NFL right now, in the world of fragmentation, it continues to set records. We would like, as I said, we would like another World Series game or two and that\u2019s a variation in it, but it\u2019s still great content in baseball.\nAnd the programming has great appeal. It is sports as a unique strength in the world of DVRs and all the like, there isn\u2019t anything like it. There isn\u2019t a second World Series or a second Super Bowl or a second NFC championship game. And it is has unique value in the marketplace. The issue with it is they come with big price tags. It\u2019s been a great part of building Fox. We\u2019ve like it to continue to be a part of building Fox, but we\u2019ve got to negotiate rates that enable us to believe it make sense. I think our goal.\nWe think it has been important. It\u2019s been valuable to us. We\u2019d like it to continue to be a part of our story. But we\u2019ve got a make sure it\u2019s on terms that make sense. Obviously, retransmission does help. I mean I think it would, if you\u2019d been asset supported only business and asset orderly [ph] business, I think probably overtime, you wouldn\u2019t find any of these sports on any other networks on that business model.\nBut I think as they build the business model, that enables them to compete in a more level playing field. It has profitability businesses with exciting long-term futures, then it enable to compete for rights. But as with any rights, you\u2019ve got to be disciplined and at some point rights get too expensive, though they\u2019re rights we clearly like to have. And I\u2019d certainly put the sports rights in that category. Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nAnd just as a follow-up on some of the earlier calls on digital distribution, TV Everywhere and authentication is starting to come to fruition a little bit in the market. But you\u2019ve made some waves around Google TV. I think someone from Google was quoted in the press in saying the, broadcasters don\u2019t get it. And one question I\u2019m wondering if you would address, are you thinking about different devices or different screens as a way to window this content, which is a little bit of a nuance versus how we typically think about doing, which is the calendar.\nIn other words, would to make content available on mobile platform are on a PC, but disable it on a television screen? How do you think about that piece of the story? Chase Carey\nIn the house, the difference between screens, I mean, is going to continue to diminish their sort of PC and TV. If you get more Internet-ready TVs and the like. I do think mobile is probably a more discrete platform that is obviously different because it has the really get it anywhere. I do think the iPad or the tablet devices are really going to redefine that whole mobile experience. So it\u2019s very early stages, but I think what will be the true, I think the Apples will grow fast now through the next couple of years.\nYou\u2019ll really start to have it big enough universe out there to meaningfully determine how do you develop that offer, how do we build on that opportunity; it is a real opportunity for us. And I\u2019m not sure if you went into the home system, which screens the way longer term. I think in the short-term, it could exist but I do think those screens are going to blend.\nAnd I think it does come back to figuring out probably more what is the business models for our content and what are the right terms, and I think we need to work on. It is a tremendously valuable content, it\u2019s tremendously valuable. We need to manage it. We need to make sure as we make it available, were making it available on the right terms as much as like the movie business is done historically creating a series of Windows that went from theatrical to video to pay to free.\nNow, it\u2019s talking about a VOD window that may be ahead of the DVD window. But you continue to figure out how do you create the right windows on the right business terms. I do think one of the things that I would get public about as people talk about, broadcasters versus cable. And again I think that distinction is sort of ill-founded. I mean in essence if you\u2019re going to create original programming on a cable channel, why is that sort of ones in the real versus great in our original programming on our network.\nI mean its great original programming, you ought to manage accordingly. Figure out how do you exploit that programming. I think it\u2019s a good thing for us to enable our customers to access that programming in new and exciting and interesting ways. I think that\u2019s a great opportunity for us to do that. But we need to do it in ways that have us fairly compensated for our value of our content. Like our content is incredibly valuable, we can\u2019t just throw it out there to everybody. We got to make sure that we\u2019re putting it out there on terms that get us fairly compensated for the content we create. \nBenjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nThanks a lot.\nReed Nolte\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nComes from Tom Eagan, Collins Stewart. Thomas Eagan \u2013 Collins Stewart\nSuper, thank you. Just on home entertainment revenue, Chase, I think Time Warner has said that year-to-date; their home entertainment revenue was up about 8%. What was at your date so far at News Corp.? And then I have a follow-up, thanks.Chase Carey\nI think it\u2019s actually up about 10%. And Home Entertainment business because a lot of people sort of going down. It\u2019s actually stabilize for us with each [ph] segments that were going down were actually seeing some nice light there right now. Thomas Eagan \u2013 Collins Stewart\nRight, okay. And then separately, on TV syndication, you mentioned Modern Family. What other titles would be thinking about for the balance of fiscal \u201811? Chase Carey\nI think Dave cited a couple, so I don\u2019t know. How I Met Your Mother is the one that came in.\nThomas Eagan \u2013 Collins Stewart\nRight.\nChase Carey\nThere are a couple of cable properties, I think that \u2026\nUnidentified Company Representative\nAmerican Dad ...\nDavid DeVoe\nAmerican Miracle [inaudible] \u2026\nChase Carey\nAmerican Dad and I\u2019d say \u2026\nThomas Eagan \u2013 Collins Stewart\nRight.\nChase Carey\nWhich one of the cable original, both one of the cable franchises as well. Thomas Eagan \u2013 Collins Stewart\nAnd the pricing of that, are you seeing it up from what it was a year ago? Chase Carey\nAnd it\u2019s tough \u2013 the shows are different shows.\nThomas Eagan \u2013 Collins Stewart\nYes.\nChase Carey\nI mean it\u2019s a pretty big can. I mean its good apples and oranges to sort of compare one to the other. I mean certainly, I think the cable market as buying market continues to be a very strong market. I think you\u2019ve seen in this sport industry segment that sort of the prices of things like half hours really move to and we obviously or beneficiary Modern Family, move the whole new levels just in the last year or plus.\nSo, that\u2019s the market. And I think the Broadcast business certainly has come out of it\u2019s the hole it was in a couple of years ago. We\u2019ve got to strike stronger ad market there. So, make that market certainly seems to have been stabilized. But we stop to make those year-over-year comparisons because it\u2019s going to be title driven. \nThomas Eagan \u2013 Collins Stewart\nRight, great. Thank you.\nChase Carey\nYes.\nReed Nolte\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nThat comes from Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse. Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse\nThanks. Just two quick questions. The first for Chase, recognizing that you guys are still involved in the BSkyB transaction, but was wondering if you could speak to News Corp.\u2019s appetite for acquisitions at this stage? There\u2019s been some chatter about perhaps some interest in Yahoo! with the help of outside financing, for example?\nAnd then secondly, perhaps for Dave, I know you said that the TV stations are running up about 20% in ad revenues a quarter today. I was wondering if you give us a sense about the looking post the elections for the rest of the quarter. Thanks.Chase Carey\nNow, I guess something like Yahoo! or the press meetings have things to write about. But I think we are now certainly do not need to make any acquisitions. I think we\u2019ve got a great portfolio of businesses that we can grow across aggressively that a good diversification amongst them. And I think what we want to be is make sure we\u2019re start about things, look at things that are out there and if there\u2019s something there and we should consider it.\nBut what we\u2019re going to do so in a very disciplined way. I mean we say that we look it up cable channel; we looked at travel Channel a year ago. We kicked the tires on something overseas recently. And ultimately, they were people looking for values that didn\u2019t make sense to us. And our general preference is to build businesses, not buy businesses. It\u2019s the way that we build the great businesses in News Corp., it\u2019s what where our focus will continue remain.\nBut if we see something that we can \u2013 we think we could acquire at a very attractive price that fits, I think we\u2019d want to take a look at it. But we\u2019re going to do so in a very disciplined way. We\u2019re certainly not out shopping for anything. And again, I think our priority and our focus, and our preference is to build this businesses and I think we\u2019ve got real opportunities to do that. David DeVoe\nAnd as far as on the pacing, we\u2019re staying pretty strong in the second quarter. I think we\u2019re about around 11% X political, so business is very, very healthy. \nSpencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse\nGreat, thank you.\nReed Nolte\nOperator, I think we have time for one more question from the financial community.\nOperator\nOkay. And that will come from Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead.Douglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nThanks so much to sneak it in.\nReed Nolte\nOkay.\nDouglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nSo, Chase, more on cable networks. I guess Dave and Chase. Dave, I just want to make sure there\u2019s no unusual items driving the growth in cable networks like acquisitions?\nAnd then, Chase, I mean you talked in this call about building rather buying. You talked about the young channels that are driving such strong growth there. Today\u2019s young channels were yesterday\u2019s new launches. Are you curious when you look at the strategic outlook for cable networks, is there a focus on or a need to continue to stoke the fire with new cable networks launches or is this the stable channels that we should be thinking about for the foreseeable future? Chase Carey\nNo. I think the opportunities to build new channels are probably pretty few and far between. I think you\u2019ve got a lot of mouth there, I won\u2019t there say there won\u2019t be one. But I think right now you\u2019ve got a pretty big group of channels, but we\u2019ve got a lot of growth there. We got channels that FX and Nat Geo to which we\u2019re still adding subscribers in a significant way that are not \u2013 that we have room to continue to grow even with our big channels.\nSo, it\u2019s not just a little channels where we can add to. And obviously, overseas, it\u2019s a whole different case. I mean overseas, are business that are a much earlier stage. So, the U.S. business I think the places you\u2019d add channel with the fewer far between. I think internationally, it\u2019s a different case. I think domestically, the opportunities are really to take channels and take them to whole new levels.\nAnd again, I think use the examples that you used before. Make Nat Geo, Discovery or make FX USA and that opportunity would be increasing our profit and cash flow by multiples not percentages. David DeVoe\nAnd that\u2019s a strike in the business. I mean you\u2019re getting great franchise cable channels with great revenue growth, driving great margins. Douglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nHave you fully monetized your domestic channels by launching among your international pay-TV platforms? Have you pushed those out as aggressively as you think you should? Chase Carey\nYes. We monetized \u2013 our domestic channels internationally? Douglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nYes, are you taking domestic channels through your pay-TV platforms internationally as much as you think you should? Chase Carey\nWe certainly, we\u2019ve taken them very broadly. I mean I guess are the platforms, which I guess would be more specifically the European platforms or India, we certainly done some. But the international channels are really territories and across the row, we certainly have done it. I mean and things like that. Just some a more exportable than others.\nI mean like Nat Geos, certainly our content and entertainment. We have reviews to drive entertainment channel. Sports is probably applies that\u2019s a bit more local in its contents. News, again, what we do some, it\u2019s probably a bit more local. But certainly, big part of the international story is that it takes advantage of the economy and the efficiencies of using product that travels around the world. We got a lot of products that travels around the world and even movies, TVs, documentaries and the like.\nSome of it is a bit more local. But we\u2019ve got an awful lot that\u2019s travels around the world and that is what the look to take advantage of. And I guess in the cable channels, the growth, the other dimension to growth is I think going forward is really the digital arena. How do take this product and do people down the road want to get Fox News on an iPad, so that they watch it when their at home. And how do you take forward and develop opportunities that are like that. And I think those businesses \u2013 I think there are an array of ways that we can continue to build and add to in ways that exciting for customers and attractive for us.\nAnd it\u2019s to building these franchises, build the content we launched in these franchises, original products. I mean FX has done a good job as anybody in the business in terms of launching great, unique original programming, how do we exploit it, how do we develop digital platforms to digital experiences forth that are compatible with FX. I mean I think we have to make sure we do it in a way that was compatible with our core distributors and they make sense, and is additive to our business. I think those opportunities are all there for us. Douglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nThanks, Chase. Then Dave, just to confirm, no unusual items driving growth? David DeVoe\nNo unusual items driving growth.\nDouglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nThank you.\nDavid DeVoe\nJust great businesses and some great revenue growth. \nReed Nolte\nThank you.\nDouglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nThank you.\nReed Nolte\nOperator, now, we\u2019d now like to go to questions from the press, please. \nOperator\nOkay. Our first one comes for Claire Atkinson, New York Post. Please, go ahead.Claire Atkinson \u2013 New York Post\nHi, Chase. How are you?\nChase Carey\nAll right. How are you doing?\nClaire Atkinson \u2013 New York Post\nGood, very well. You talked about wanting broadcast to look more like cable. Beyond growing revenue stream, are there any ways that broadcast can look cable? And then second question, how far off do you see a premium video window? Chase Carey\nIt\u2019s hard that\u2019s what\u2019s I\u2019m really talking about at dual revenue stream business.\nClaire Atkinson \u2013 New York Post\nOkay.\nChase Carey\nSo that\u2019s \u2013 it is really, and there are other nuances you can debate sort of and I know everyone has started talking to Broadcast business. You take great 25 piles to define five shows, cable business is more selective about making cohabit something for 30 episodes and putting it on. So, I think there are other aspects of \u2013 if those businesses can learn from each other.\nBut at its core, what you\u2019re seeing is you\u2019ve got a cable business that it\u2019s dual revenue business that is a very healthy strong business. You got a Broadcast business trying to compete with one RBI in its back without a dual revenue stream and it needs to have a dual revenue \u2013 the strongest programming and has audiences that are multiples of any other cable channel out there and are ought to fairly valued.\nAnd we\u2019ve approached this realistically with a spirit of fairness. I mean we could be asking if you\u2019re looking at the competitive base because we should be looking for a lot more than we are and I think we\u2019ve tried to be constructive about them. Claire Atkinson \u2013 New York Post\nAnd on the premium video? Chase Carey\nThe premium, you mean the window some [ph]?\nClaire Atkinson \u2013 New York Post\nYes, like the \u2026\nChase Carey\nI think it\u2019s something that\u2019s active right now. I\u2019m not going to put a timeframe to it. But \u2026\nClaire Atkinson \u2013 New York Post\nOkay.\nChase Carey\nBut I think it\u2019s something that is active in discussion. \nClaire Atkinson \u2013 New York Post\nOkay. Thank you very much.\nReed Nolte\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Sarah Rabil, Bloomberg News. Please, go ahead.Sarah Rabil \u2013 Bloomberg News\nHi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to expand a little bit further on the film windowing strategy. There are some talks that studios could benefit by further delaying DVD delivery to Netflix and Redbox and the like, and I just wanted to see what your stance on that was? Chase Carey\nRight now, we have the 28th window. I think that\u2019s been a good thing for us. We haven\u2019t been there that long I think probably want to \u2013 I do think it\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue to evaluate. So, I think directionally, that\u2019s been a good thing. I think we\u2019ve got a \u2013 okay, a bit better handle and a bit more data around it to determine where and what is the right sequencing.\nI think as BOD continues to grow, you are going to continue to have change in the windowing strategy between DVDs and electronics and when people talk about premiums and the like that this is things will continue to evolve. But again, what I think is that we feel that windowing we\u2019ve done has been good for us and will evaluate where we go from here as we go forward.\nSarah Rabil \u2013 Bloomberg News\nThanks.\nReed Nolte\nNext question, please.\nOperator\nComes from Georg Szalai, Hollywood Reporter. Please, go ahead.Georg Szalai \u2013 Hollywood Reporter\nHi, Chase. I was wondering if you have any initial color on how the Apple TV rental offer has been going, anything you can share on that? Chase Carey\nNot a lot. It\u2019s pretty new. I mean it\u2019s only really relevant once you get the season launched. It\u2019s barely a month into it. So, I think it\u2019s pretty early to be making judgments amongst into something. \nReed Nolte\nThank you. Next question, please.\nOperator\nAnd that comes from Amanda Andrews, Daily Telegraph. Please, go ahead.\nAmanda Andrews \u2013 Daily Telegraph\nHi. I was wondering what your vision is for the U.K, European market to replace the Sky obviously, if you would in Sky? And sort of further on would you consider buying U.K. European production. So it\u2019s going to be some that will come up for sale like Endemol, for example? Chase Carey\nI\u2019m not going \u2013 I mean I\u2019m not going to \u2013 first, I\u2019m not going to comment on really the Sky transaction. And probably not \u2026Amanda Andrews \u2013 Daily Telegraph\nWell, no. I\u2019m just talking about a vision, you\u2019re vision post [ph], obviously, and hence that\u2019s position.Chase Carey\nI think our \u2013 look our focus, we have three big businesses to that are really in early growth stage. I mean in one in very early growth stage in Germany. Italy, there was a lot of growth left ahead of it. And I think our focus is to build those businesses. We\u2019ve got the channel business across Europe, which has continued to grow. And I think there\u2019s some markets that were not \u2013 that I think are opportunities for us today to expand our channels.\nSo, again, back on the sort of the build versus buy theme, I think our think our focus today is really to build the platforms in Italy and Germany, to build a channels we have across Europe. I think, as I say, forward we\u2019ll be opportunistic and see what\u2019s there, if there\u2019s something that made sense. I think we\u2019d look at it. But our honest focus is we\u2019re not on a \u2013 out on a hunting or a shopping spree. I think our focus is on building those businesses. Amanda Andrews \u2013 Daily Telegraph\nWhere do you look at future synergies between BSkyB, Sky Italia, Deutschland, do you think? Or I don\u2019t know maybe some cost-saving opportunities like buying productions together, anything like that at all? Chase Carey\nNo, we said before that Sky transactions is not based on synergies. The businesses we run today, we\u2019re focused on building them to their potential. Amanda Andrews \u2013 Daily Telegraph\nAnd then what about the buying TV production companies in Europe? Is that under consideration?Chase Carey\nAgain, I\u2019d rather we \u2013 we know a lot about TV production. I guess I\u2019d rather be building them than buying. I guess if there was something uniquely interesting, we\u2019d look at it. But I think our focus is to build those things. I mean we do run a pretty big TV production business today. So, it\u2019s certainly something we know about and we know well and that will continue to our focus, to build on those opportunities.\nWe produced programming in a lot of countries today. We produced programming in Italy, we produced programming in India, we produced programming in places around the world. So, we certainly have a lot of TV production going on. The most of it in the U.S.\nAmanda Andrews \u2013 Daily Telegraph\nYes.\nChase Carey\nBut in an array of countries around the world. And again, our focus will be to continue to build those things. \nAmanda Andrews \u2013 Daily Telegraph\nThank you.\nReed Nolte\nOperator, I think we have time for last question from the press.\nOperator\nOkay. And that comes from Jeff Bercovici with Forbes. Please, go ahead.\nJeff Bercovici \u2013 Forbes\nHi, there. I saw the announcement that you guys made about the numbers of digital sales coming from the times of London hay wall. Just wondering there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about how successful or not that initiative has been. We\u2019d like to hear from you if you think that those numbers are \u2013 I mean is that a pretty good idea of what you\u2019re going to see from this? Or do you see that is just kind of the tip of what you can do in terms of digital sales?\nAnd also with all these reports that News Corp. is developing an iPad native newspaper for the U.S. are those the kinds of numbers that you have in mind for new digital business that you\u2019ll be doing? Chase Carey\nYes. I mean in terms of the digital product in Europe, I mean in the U.K., we feel very good about it. And realistically, it\u2019s very early. Digital as a whole, some of these platforms like tablets are just emerging. This is not something that is sort of a one or two quarter gain. I mean this is something that\u2019s going to continue to build over years. And I think we feel that this is a great start, a great foundation, and we really look forward to continuing to build on this. And the whole digital arena is continuing to evolve and build and we\u2019ve got a lot in the broader topic. We have \u2013 I think we are looking at array of digital opportunities when we get to a place, but if there\u2019s something we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019ll announce it. \nReed Nolte\nWell, thank you everybody for joining us today\u2019s call.

Welcome to Best Buy's investor conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 12 O\u2019 Clock PM Eastern time today. (Operator instructions). I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJennifer Driscoll\nThank you David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating at short notice in this afternoon's investor conference call to discuss our exciting news this morning. We have two speakers for you today. First, Brad Anderson, our current CEO, will provide a brief recap of today's announcement and why the timing was right for him, for Brian and for our company. Second, Brian Dunn, our next CEO, will give you a taste of what to expect from him as he prepares to assume his new role. \nOur prepared remarks will only last six, seven minutes, and the balance of our time will be devoted to your questions of Brad and Brian. We would appreciate it if you could focus your questions on today's announcement and keep it at a fairly strategic level. Consistent with our quarterly earnings calls, we request that callers limit themselves to a single question so that we can include more people in our Q&A session. We will stay on the line with you in case clarification is needed. \nWe would like to remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Best Buy may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. May we also remind you that, as usual, the media are participating in this call in a listen-only mode. \n And with that, let's turn the call over to Brad Anderson, who will begin our prepared remarks.\nBrad Anderson\nThat's an interesting freudian slip. \nJennifer Driscoll\nI said Brian.\nBrad Anderson\nThanks, Jennifer, and thanks to our listeners for participating in this afternoon's call. It is with mixed emotions that I announce my retirement. it's effective in June, which is consistent with the company's succession plan and the timeframe that I had desired. My emotions are mixed because I'm extremely excited about Brian's appointment, as I will explain in a moment. But at the same time, I'll naturally miss my daily interaction with our employees, our vendors, our customers and our investors. I've enjoyed tremendously my 30-plus years with Best Buy. I can't imagine another line of work in which you can combine meetings on true innovations from our customers with efforts to create a strength-based culture and then meet with world leaders as a part of the job responsibility. \nThat said, the timing of the decision is consistent with my intentions when I accepted the role, and I feel the timing is appropriate for me, for Brian and for Best Buy. It's right for me because I'd like to work less and spend more time with my family. It's right for Brian because he's ready for the new challenge, which also makes it right for Best Buy and our shareholders. I'm genuinely excited that the Board has appointed Brian Dunn as CEO. \nI believe Brian is absolutely and indisputably the right leader for us as we embark on the next phase of our growth. We are very fortunate to have someone of Brian's caliber to develop the brand further and accelerate our strategy of customer-centricity. Moreover, I believe that Brian deeply understands one aspect of the company that is very precious to me. At Best Buy, people today can still do what I did, and what Brian did. \nI started a job which turned into an adventure and, through discovery, was able to achieve more than I dreamed possible using the unique strengths I had as a human being. Brian had exactly the same experience. Because he likewise cherishes this side of Best Buy and the views of our company -- and views that our company is a collection of these individual stories. I know he will build upon it and attract more people to our overall story, our large story. \nOver the next 18 months I intend to complete my term as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, and as part of that I will assist with Brian's transition and support the continuation of the company's strategy and our unique culture. During his tenure as President and COO, Brian has driven industry-leading performance from the company's domestic business. He has taken us to new highs in terms of market share, employee retention, vendor relationships and customer satisfaction scores. He has established himself as a powerful brand representative, a strong motivator of employees and a tremendous steward of the company's core values. \nBrian has demonstrated an ability to connect with people and inspire them to work together to accomplish extraordinary things. There's no question he has proven himself ready to take the mantle of leadership as Best Buy's CEO. As a company, we believe Brian is best able to lead our company as he chooses from a compelling array of options for navigating the current environment and preparing for the exciting opportunities that lay ahead. \nIt has been an honor and a privilege to serve our employees and shareholders and to work with such a high-caliber team in building Best Buy to what it is today. And with that, here's Brian Dunn.\nBrian Dunn\nGood afternoon, everyone, and I want to begin by saying thank you to Brad Anderson. Brad, thank you for your tenacity, for your belief that some things are worth fighting for; in fact, worth standing alone for against a company and an industry that can't quite see it yet. And thank you for your courage. By sheer force of will, you have turned this company's focus from the products we sell to the people we serve, customers. And you did it when we were riding high. when Best Buy could easily have been resting on its laurels, you were preaching caution. And it was not a popular point of view, but you were right and it took courage to fight for it. \nAnd finally, I want to thank you personally for being a mentor to me. The 2.5 years I\u2019ve served as your COO have been the best times of my professional life and the first. I've got to be honest; they have been the most fun and the least fun. Life is a paradox, and that's something else you've taught me. Seriously, I\u2019ve learned a ton from you about the importance of sharpening a point of view and fighting for it and about the difference one courageous person with a sharp point of view can make and I thank you for that. \nThe truth, as Brad knows, is that the progress we have made in organizing around the customer is always in danger of erosion. We know we must recommit to customer centricity every day, and we will, not simply because I say we will but because it's becoming woven into this company's culture. In many respects, and I know Brad agrees with this, the work is just beginning. Because of the work Brad has led, Best Buy has earned the opportunity to play a unique role in the lives of people and to help, to help people unlock the promise of technology. \nI intend to use the assets of a $40 billion multinational company and the insights and ideas of 165,000 individual employees to do it. It's a powerful combination. I have been reflecting a lot on my almost 24 years with this company, for obvious reasons. From our local roots, competing with regional competitors like shock electronics and highland super stores in the '80s to the years of pitched battle with Circuit City, and we have always well off the challenge, and we have always come out on top, for one reason. And that is that we have always ultimately placed our destiny in the hands of the men and women closest to the customer. As long as I'm around, that will continue to be the Best Buy way, even and especially as we find ourselves in competition with some of the biggest and best companies in the history of retail. Make no mistake, we continue to be in uncharted economic waters, but one thing is certain. \nOur strategy remains unchanged. We steadfastly believe in the course we're charting, the course the company set six years ago when we launched this strategy. The current retail landscape around the world creates an unprecedented opportunity for us to earn the business of new customers and grow share. We know we are currently up against extremely difficult economic times, but we also understand that these times through their very nature will create new opportunities for those who manage their resources well and yet stay close to the customer. \nThis thing we call technology is really an increasingly constant backdrop in people's lives -- at home, at work, on the road and literally in the palms of their hands. We call it the connected world, and as exciting as it is, it is also complex and difficult to keep pace with. And that's where we come in. We believe the value we can bring to people in helping them unlock the promise of technology is literally universal, applicable everywhere, and we're committed to earning new customers around the world.\nLet me close by saying how honored I am to be given the opportunity to lead this wonderful organization. I\u2019m determined to use the tremendous assets that are disposal to build a future for this company for both employees and investors that is worthy of its past. \nWith that, we\u2019d like to open the call for the questions from our audience. \nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n \n(Operator instructions). First question is from the line of  Brian Nagel with UBS. Please go ahead. \nBrian Nagel - UBS \nHi, good afternoon. \nBrian Dunn\nGood afternoon Brian.\nBrian Nagel - UBS \nBrad and Brian, congratulations to both of you. \nBrian Dunn\nThank you.\nBrad Anderson\nThanks.\nBrian Nagel - UBS \nBrian, a question for you, from a strategic perspective. You're clearly taking the reins of Best Buy at an interesting time for the company and for the industry, with your primary competitor deciding to liquidate just a few days ago. How do you view the market share opportunity for Best Buy in this changing dynamic, both from a near-term and longer-term perspective? \nBrian Dunn\nWell, I think in the near-term the opportunity is clear. We have an opportunity to earn that business that had previously been shopping with Circuit City, and we intend to be very focused in targeting that customer group and inviting them into Best Buy. I think longer-term that sets us up nicely for the opportunity to more broadly play in this connected world with more customers, and this is entirely about customer acquisition for us as we go through this difficult time. \nBrian Nagel - UBS \nAnd just one follow-up if I could, and I know it has only been a few days since the liquidation announcement. But have the conversations with your key vendors changed since that has happened? \nBrian Dunn\nI can\u2019t comment on the recent conversation with our key vendors, but I can say this. The relationship we have had with our vendors over the last 24 months continues to be extremely strong, and we are very pleased as we look out over the horizon the opportunities that we can, together with our key vendors, participate in. \nOperator\nThank you, sir. And our next question comes from the line of David Schick with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead. \nDavid Schick - Stifel Nicolaus \nHi, good afternoon and thanks for doing the call. \nBrian Dunn\nThanks David.\nDavid Schick - Stifel Nicolaus \nIt's a sort of a different take on Brian's question. Do you think strategically over three or five years, does Best Buy act differently in the marketplace without Circuit City? And in what ways, perhaps? \nBrian Dunn\nI don't know if we act differently. I think what Best Buy does over the next three to five years is we continue to get deep with our customer and we continue to be a place where we can offer our customers the broad spectrum from coming in for the cheapest television they get their hands on for Aunt Louise, to the most complex sort of solution they want to build for themselves and a personal network around their lives. And I think what changes at Best Buy over the next three to five years, we take what we learn and we put it in play in this world of connected digital services, and we really help people build networks around themselves, around their lives that allows them to have the things they want where they want them, when they want them. \nOperator\nThank you, sir. \nBrian Dunn\nThank you.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Mitch Kaiser with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nMitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray \nThanks guys, congratulations to you both. \nBrain Dunn\nGood morning, Mitch.\nMitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray \nCould you talk a little bit about the timing of the announcement? I know obviously you are going through a pretty major restructuring. And maybe, just relate that to the decision to do it right now? \nBrad Anderson\nI'll tackle -- I sort of had three things in mind as I thought the timing from personal standpoint, one of which is -- and by far, the most important is, I've always believed that the job of the CEO is to get the next CEO ready. And the next CEO needs to be better than the one -- than you are. And the minute you believe that's the case, you need to take action on that. So part of my moving to want to do this right now is the belief that Brian is ready to take on the responsibility, and he can take the company farther than we are. Second, I think that the turmoil of the moment is actually an opportunity. I keep looking at things in the context of essentially storytelling. And this team has got a big challenge it faces that is going to take years to fully solve. And I think the sort of challenge of this leadership team, this new leadership team, taking this on and owning the brand and owning the outcome of taking the company to the next level it needs to come to, it's the right moment in time to do that. And third is, we've just asked a number of employees to leave on a voluntary basis because of the needs of the company and the needs of the company to adjust. In a sense, I think it\u2019s not a bad time for me to join them. \nOperator\nThank you, sir. And our next  question is from the line of Michael Lasser with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser - Barclays Capital\nGood afternoon and thanks for taking my question and let me add my congratulations to everyone as well; a question for Brian. The difficult environment has motivated the company to be more selective with how it allocates resources and, more specifically, cut costs. How quickly do you return to an aggressive posture with respect to making investments, whether it be operating expenses or CapEx, when you see a normalized environment returning? And could that view be somewhat obscured because of the market share gains you are likely to experience with the absence of Circuit City? \nBrian Dunn\nLet me say it this way, Michael. I want to be very clear. We are not retiring investment in growth opportunities that we see. It's very fair to say that we are being more selective as we look at the wide array of options that have been developed under Brad's leadership. And there are a number of places, and I think about our Best Buy Mobile business, for instance, that we have talked about at length. There are places where we can make meaningful investment now that helps us with this connectivity we want to provide to our customers. You will continue to see us do that. You will also see us be very prudent with the investments we make in this difficult environment. We understand the importance of things like operating cash flows and liquidity and all those sorts of notions. So you are going to see us make investments in areas that we have very developed hypotheses in, and I think over time you are going to see us continue to have an appetite to explore new avenues and new growth streams for us. But you are going to see some very focused attention from us on where we deploy resources through this storm. \nOperator\n(Operator instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba with FTN Midwest Securities. Please go ahead. \nAnthony Chukumba - FTN Midwest Securities \nHi, let me add my congratulations as well. \nBrian Dunn\nThank  you.\nAnthony Chukumba - FTN Midwest Securities \nJust had a sort of a broad strategic question -- obviously, there has been a number of new initiatives and investments recently, The Carphone Warehouse joint venture, going into China, now going into London, this summer possibly going into Mexico and Turkey. I guess my question was, with the change in leadership, is it just sort of status quo, let's continue to execute the strategy, continue to make these investments? Or, is there any sort of reevaluating some of the strategies that you've recently laid out? \nBrian Dunn\nThank you for the question. There's nothing status quo about it. We have opened in Mexico City, and we are very pleased with the early outcomes there. We believe this notion of taking an engaged employee and asking them to participate with their experiences and their passions and what they have learned and connecting that with a customer that has real needs around technology and helping that customer put the technology in service of their lives, as opposed to being imprisoned by it. We think that is sort of a universal value proposition. You combine that with strong, engaged local leadership, and which we are blessed, and I think we have \u2013 I\u2019m confident that we have a recipe that is successful, will be successful in all of places we take it. So our appetite in Mexico and China and Europe is unabated. In fact, we see those opportunities as even being more important as we go forward. \nJennifer Driscoll\nThank you Brian next question please.\nOperator\nThank you, and our next question comes from the line of Daniel Binder, with Jeffries & Company. \nDaniel Binder \u2013 Jeffries & Company\nHi it\u2019s Dan Binder. Just a real question on philosophical differences, if any. I don't think there huge, between the two of you. But I'm curious as rising stars come up through an organization, I have to imagine there's sort of a short list that they sort of build in their head and say, hey, if I was CEO, I'd want to do this, this and this. I'm just curious if you could share with us a little bit about what we might expect that would be a little bit different. And then secondly, with the recent voluntary departures, I'm just curious. Are there any meaningful gaps that you think need to be addressed sooner rather than later, where you may have had some stronger voluntary departures than you expected? \nBrad Anderson\nLet me just -- just to set the table, I just wanted to share my own experience when I was -- it's a fairly similar circumstance. It was announced at the end of January in 2002 that, at the annual meeting in June, I would take over as CEO. So in a sense, we are repeating a pattern. What I did when I had an opportunity, that interval this was following on after Dick Schultze, was I had always had differences in terms of the way I looked at the business and what I wanted to do. I took that interval of about five months to really refine the message and the point of view that I subsequently, with the annual meeting, was then able to realize. And so from the lens, in terms of -- it's hard, I think, for a new CEO to announce the difference of position while I'm still here. \nBrian Dunn\n(Multiple speakers). I, too, will tell you -- as you rightly call out, I started off as a salesperson in this Company almost 24 years ago and have made all the steps in between. And, at every single level, I have thought to myself, boy, when I get there I'm going to do this, this and this. And invariably, the richness and the complexity of the challenges always inform your point of view. So I intend to take the weeks and months ahead and get very sharp around my point of view and where I'm going to take this organization directionally, building on the beautiful foundation that Brad has set for us. \nBrad Anderson\nAnd then there was the second -- \nBrian Dunn\nAround the voluntary -- so when you embark on a path, as we have -- and I'm very proud of the organization in that we put our money where our mouth is, put our values right front and center in a tough time, and Best Buy endeavors to stand for choice -- choice for our customers, choice for our employees. So we provided our employees a choice and gave them an attractive option to choose. And I'm very happy for all the people that chose it, and for many, many, and for all the varied reasons, I'm thrilled for all of them. And of course, there are some places where it has created talent gaps.\nAnd Best Buy, we are blessed in that we have 165,000 people and a rich bench and a rich set of points of view, people who are anxious to step in and make their mark and make their difference. And that's part of any sort of transition, generational transition, if you will. And I'm actually quite excited about the energy that that will bring to us. I also think that this is a great opportunity for us to be thinking about not only talent we have inside the Company, but to look outside for fresh perspectives and skill sets that might not be readily available here. And, I also believe that it gives us a bit of a gift that we're going to be able to move faster around some of the transitions we'd like to do. \nDaniel Binder \u2013 Jeffries & Company\nThank you.\nJennifer Driscoll\nThank you Brad and Brian \nOperator\nAnd our final question comes from the line of Jason Blair with Rockdale. Please go ahead.\nJason Blair - Rockdale\nThank you for taking my call, and Brian, congratulations on your new role with the Company.\nBrian Dunn\nThank you very much.\nJason Blair - Rockdale\nI wanted to ask the success of customer-centricity, I guess, comes from maximizing gross margin by focusing on a profitable customer base that you can up sell to higher price points and attach services and warranties to. But it seems to me that it's a niche business model. So now, with 21% share in the US, do you risk outgrowing your niche? And, does your current share limit your ability to fend off discount competitors like Wal-Mart, Costco and Amazon that have done a really good job of picking off a lot of your profit pools? \nBrian Dunn\nIt's a great question and it's a nice description of the front end. And I'm right with you, right up to the niche piece. I don't think that it's a niche. I think there are broad -- across the broad spectrum, there are places that we can create value for our customer segments from the opening price point, all the way through the most premium sale you might imagine. As I mentioned earlier in the call, I also think that this has global ramifications. You take this core value proposition that you know the customer, your customers, better than anyone else, and you take this rich array of strategic vendor partnerships. And you take that knowledge and this network of partners you have, and you can create solutions, if you will, for customers across a broad bandwidth. So I don't see it as targeted to just a high-end niche, if you will. I see it as very much across the broad spectrum of our customer base. \nJennifer Driscoll\nAnd do you want to talk about Best Buy Mobile as an example? \nBrian Dunn\nI think that's a great -- I think, if you take Best Buy Mobile, is the sort of vivid example of this, our Best Buy Mobile and the work we have done that's not just -- that's right out of customer centricity, right out of what we learned about our customers and what our employees were telling us about how we were participating in that business and how poorly we were participating in that business. And what we have learned through its success, and it continues to be a great success, is that this value proposition has elements that appeal to a broad bandwidth of customers, and it's directionally very, very encouraging for us. \nOperator\nThank you, and Ms. Driscoll, I have no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to you. \nJennifer Driscoll\nThanks, David, and thanks to our audience for participating in our investor conference call at short notice.

Darren?\nDarren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThanks, Zaheed. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. Joining me on the call today is our President, George Sherman, who will update you on our business operations including our integration activities; and Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer, who will update you on our financial performance.\nWe are 18 months into our integration, and our confidence in the growth, earnings and service potential of this combination remains very strong. The 2015 enterprise priorities continue to be improving our base business execution and successfully delivering the year-two integration objectives. Through the first half of this year, we have been focused on aligning our teams, processes, systems and capabilities to a common foundation. Overall, the base business execution and the integration remain on track, and our results for the quarter were in line with expectations.\nIn the quarter, our sales grew 1% to $2.37 billion. The comparable sales were up 1% led by commercial, with our DIY business sequentially improving. Earnings per share on a comparable basis grew 9.1% in the quarter on top of last year's 30% growth. Industry fundamentals continue to remain positive including vehicles in operation, gas prices, miles-driven and a steadily improving economy. Regionally, the results are not equally distributed across the country. We saw solid performance in Canada, the Northeast, the Southeast, including the Florida market. Conversely, our upper Midwest markets underperformed in the quarter, principally driven by weather, while our Puerto Rico market experienced softness as a result of the economic uncertainty.\nAlso our sales growth from our import-focused branches of Worldpac and Autopart International continued to deliver strong total results. We continued to work through the five key integration priorities outlined on our previous calls. George will provide more details and a status update shortly.\nOverall, I am pleased with the progress we made during the quarter with the integration activities. As expected, the integration work continues to have a more concentrated temporary impact on our core commercial business. We are better balancing the extra demands resulting in a better Q2 performance. In the second quarter, our core AAP commercial business sequentially improved. However, our Carquest commercial sales continued to see some softness. The volume of integration work will subside and we expect our commercial business will in time return to delivering comps, consistently at the high end or above the high end of the market.\nOur DIY business improved sequentially approaching flat for the quarter as the teams continued to execute our DIY initiatives. In addition to the current demands of the business, we experienced a fire in our Roanoke support center this quarter. I want to recognize the teams for quickly re-establishing operations to ensure we did not experience any material downtime.\nOverall, our second quarter results were in line with our tempered expectations as we anticipated some carryover of the Q1 integration activities into this quarter. That said, the business improved steadily as our teams took additional steps towards settling into our sales and operating routines. Looking at the back half, we expect incremental progression in our business and will continue to meter our efforts to ensure our organization stays focused on serving our customers and delivering on our outcomes. The key outcomes we measure success by are sales, service and profit. We continue to be aggressively focused on accelerating all three of these.\nOn our last call, we outlined our target to deliver comparable operating profits of 12% by the end of 2017. Now being well into a multi-year integration, we have learned a lot. The biggest takeaway is need to eliminate or simplify our work and deliver what matters most to our customers. With this focus, we see an opportunity to achieve 12% faster. And have challenged ourselves now to get there by the end of 2016. This is not about adding new things, but rather pulling forward elements of the plan that were earmarked for 2017. While achieving 12% is not a final destination or full potential of our business, it is the next milestone.\nI am confident our organization will deliver on this goal. George and Mike will also provide more specifics and discuss our key initiatives during their remarks. I want to finish by sincerely thanking our team members for their remarkable commitment in supporting the changes to position our business for an outstanding future.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to George Sherman, our President. George?\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nThanks, Darren, and good morning, everyone. First I'd like to echo Darren's comments and thank all our team members for their contribution to customer service in the quarter and putting their focus and energy in meeting our customer commitments. With my prepared remarks this morning, I'll provide commentary on our second quarter base business performance together with a progress update on our integration priorities.\nEntering Q2, despite the heavier integration work, we experienced sequential improvement in the business as our team has started selling into normal business rhythms. While our comp of 1.3% in constant currency is not what we normally aspire to, it is progression we expected from Q1. We are nearly one period into our third quarter and I'm encouraged by the continued progress in our business.\nTurning to our commercial business, as Darren mentioned, our core commercial business continues to face a larger proportion of integration-related change, namely in people and products, but showed steady improvement versus Q1. There continue to be many encouraging signs including our Canadian comps growing double-digits in constant currency, our strategic account growth and a continuing strong performance of our Texas market where we're utilizing key elements of our combined resources.\nWith respect to our key customer segments, our TECHNET customer marketing program membership has grown to a record level of 7,000 members with overall sales growth continuing in the double digits year-to-date. As the program has grown, it's become clear that TECHNET could assist our customers not just with diagnostic support but with training, marketing as well as a variety of programs to help them save money and grow their businesses. TECHNET is also experiencing record program retention rates. These results were a great example of the commercial sales team recruiting solid new members that find value in the program's marketing, training, business management and other key components of the program.\nTurning to our DIY business, the Speed Perks loyalty program continues to grow and we've now surpassed the 6 million member mark, so, about 60% of our 2015 member acquisition goal. We couldn't be more pleased with this outcome. We're beginning to build critical mass and have now also successfully integrated Speed Perks into our online shopping experience that will allow us to leverage the online channel to drive more members and provide customers with an online earn and redeem capability. Speed Perks is central to our repositioning strategy to serve the heavy DIYer and the early results are encouraging. For example, from some of the data that we've analyzed from Q1, over 80% of identified customers joining are heavy DIYers, so over indexing with both the right kind of customers as well as the right kind of parts with hard parts showing particular strength.\nTurning to our integration, we've now completed our second quarter of the heavier lifting aspects of the integration. Our first quarter saw a high point of disruptions with a combination of a significant number of integration work streams. While we continue to expect some level of integration related disruption throughout the year, we saw decline in the disruption in Q2 and expect it will continue to moderate each subsequent quarter. With that in mind, I'd like to share a status update with you across the five key focus areas.\nFirst, our support center consolidation is virtually complete. Our Minneapolis office is now closed and those team members moving to Raleigh have completed their moves. Also the team member moves between Roanoke and Raleigh have also been substantially completed. Second, our field operations and sales teams are six months into their new roles or territories. While there are certainly still regions of sales underperformance as teams continue to settle in, we are generally pleased with the progress given the magnitude of the integration change. The markets that experienced the most disruption are all improving in terms of sales strength. Additionally, the sales growth gap between customers that experienced a relationship change and those that did not continues to close.\nThird, turning to our store consolidation, conversion, and relocation work. In the second quarter, we successfully completed 68 store integration projects across three markets and those went as expected. The back half of the year is slated for 200 total projects among conversions, consolidations, closures and relocations. That's a slightly lower number than we indicated last quarter because we've shifted about 20 relocations into 2016 which enables us to avoid touching the store twice. The program will continue to be executed by market, and in Q3, we will complete three more markets. Execution of these markets is already underway and initial indications are that performance will be similar to what we've seen to date.\nThe fourth priority is our product changeovers. We've continued to execute the product and pricing alignment work. The product relabel work is now largely complete. On the replacement front, we continue to replace product lines and expect to have this completed by late in the fourth quarter or early in Q1 of 2016. Results from the product conversions continue to meet expectations as our customers tell us they are very happy with our lineup of brands. Inevitably, there are also some instances where we no longer carry certain brands which a few customers have been loyal to for years and we are actively engaged in retaining those customers or replacing their business.\nOur commercial price alignment work is effectively complete. As we discussed last quarter, the price alignment positions us properly in the market. And while the impact of price movement is immediate, the fact is, it will just take some time to drive sales in unit velocity to make up for the impact where we decreased prices. All in, our product and price alignment work continues to be on track.\nOur fifth key priority focuses on our systems and supply chain integration efforts. As mentioned previously, we are focused on migrating to a common catalog and we are on pace with our development efforts. We should be in pilot in Q1 of 2016 with a rollout to follow as we indicated last quarter. This is also an enabler to aligning our supply chain systems and we remain on track to begin the integration of the Carquest in advanced DC networks by the middle of next year.\nTurning now to our efforts to expand our daily delivery program. At the end of the quarter, we had 777 Advance Auto Parts stores being serviced daily, an increase of 77 stores over the first quarter and that moves us closer to our yearend goal of 1,000 stores. I'm pleased with our overall progress on this front.\nOur focus on base business execution and successfully completing and leveraging the integration has our team focused on our next profitability goal of 12% comparable operating profit. As Darren mentioned, we are stepping up the target timeline from 2017 to 2016. The acceleration is healthy, because it requires action now to take things out of the business that are adding complexity and fragmenting the store teams' focus. Intensifying and simplifying base business execution has several components but it starts with sales, and that means consistently delivering on our sales and service objectives. You've heard me talk about how we've been driving consistency into our sales execution and we've undertaken a range of initiatives to significantly improve our sales culture.\nMoving from a corporate-led company to a field-focused organization, simplifying our operations for those things that matter most to our customers, and powering our field and store teams to make local decisions in service of the customer, and moving the business from activity-based to outcomes-based. Our steady climb to improving sales, service and profits requires us to have a heightened focus on these activities, while clearing obstacles to allow our field and store teams to stay focused on the delivery of the outcomes. We continue to take actions toward making our business more cost efficient and accelerating our transition to a field-led organization.\nServicing the customer is the number one deliverable for our field and we need to provide our stores with the ability to make that happen without additional workload and distractions. While well intended, our corporate support center is pitching faster than our stores can catch. Consequently, in order to drive greater organizational effectiveness and in turn enhance our field focus, we've made the tough but necessary decisions to cut non-essential work out of our corporate support center and have eliminated roles that were not considered core as we look to narrow the focus and reduce workload for our stores. This work will be largely completed in August.\nAdditionally, as part of our broader work to review our profitability across our store base, we are looking at those stores that are chronic underperformers and take up a disproportionate amount of our field leaders' time. It is not acceptable to have inefficient assets in the business that are consistently underperforming or unprofitable and, candidly, we'll have to make some difficult choices. While our assessments are still ongoing, we've made the initial decision to close a number of stores and Mike will provide further detail. We will be continuing with our assessments and examining performance across our store base and where necessary, adjusting our footprint accordingly.\nBase business execution will in part be driven by supply chain capabilities, a key driver of sales acceleration is inventory availability and having the right part at the right time. We are enabling that through the expansion of our daily delivery program. I provided you with an update earlier on how we are progressing on that front. As savings offsets to our ongoing investment toward daily delivery expansion, I've challenged the team to lean into initiatives that will simplify our supply chain structure but also improve the efficiency and take cost out of our overall supply chain capability. We have also fortified our supply chain senior leadership team over the past year and are confident in our ability to execute against these priorities.\nFinally, in conjunction with our integration work, we're looking to narrow our IT priorities to the vital few that drive the largest impact on our base business results. We have a very experienced new CIO in place since December of 2014 and have invested the time to develop our future systems roadmap. These are long-term components but also key near-term areas of focus and opportunities to drive greater efficiency from our IT program and enhance those core capabilities that our stores leverage to serve our customers.\nIn closing, the first half of 2015 has certainly introduced challenges to our business, some expected, some unforeseen as we work through the complex phases of the largest integration in our industry. Q2 was a step in the right direction as we focus on our base business, acceleration in our commercial business and improving our DIY performance. We are focused on execution and driving the key initiatives to achieve our 12% comparable operating profit goal by 2016 which has galvanized the organization and amplified the conviction we have to realize the full potential of this company.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, George. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to also start by thanking all of our talented team members for their commitment to serving our customers in our second quarter. In my remarks today, I plan to review the financial highlights from our second quarter, share some details on our progress toward our 12% comparable operating profit target and provide insights on the remainder of the year.\nMoving into our second quarter operating results, we delivered comparable cash EPS of $2.27 which included $0.03 of unfavorable impact from foreign currency. This was a 9.1% increase from our second quarter of 2014 and in line with our overall expectations. Included in our comparable cash EPS was $14.1 million in incremental synergy realization. On a GAAP basis, our second quarter EPS was $2.03 which included $9.8 million of intangible asset amortization associated with the acquisition of General Parts and $18.6 million of one-time integration expenses primarily related to the integration of General Parts.\nTurning to sales. Our second quarter net sales increased 1% to $2.37 billion compared to our second quarter of 2014. The sales growth was principally driven by the addition of new stores and a comparable same store sales increase of 1% partially offset by changes in our independent store count. Our comparable store sales was led by our commercial business together with a sequential improvement in our DIY business in Q1 offset by a net 34-basis-point impact from foreign currency. Our gross profit rate of 45.9% was up 64 basis points compared to second quarter of 2014. The gross profit rate improvement was primarily the result of lower product acquisition costs inclusive of the company's ongoing merchandise cost synergy savings.\nOur comparable SG&A rate was 33.8% in the quarter which improved 22 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014. This year-over-year improvement was the result of lower insurance costs and lower administrative costs driven by synergy savings and partially offset by expense deleverage as a result of low comparable store sales growth. All in, our second quarter operating income dollars on a comparable basis increased 8.7% to $285.5 million and our operating income rate increased 85 basis points over the same period last year to 12%. Our second quarter comparable cash EPS was $2.27, up 9.1% on top of last year's 30% increase.\nOperating cash flow increased approximately 3.2% to $330.8 million through the second quarter versus the same period last year. Free cash flow increased to $216.3 million through the second quarter versus $214.3 million during the same period last year. Our AP ratio for the quarter of 77.1% was essentially flat versus 77.6% last year, driven by improved vendor terms offset by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration work and by our accelerated Worldpac growth.\nAt the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.46 billion of debt on our balance sheet and our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.6 times. During the quarter we paid down approximately $157 million of debt and are progressing as planned to get back below the 2.5 times leverage ratio and maintain our strong investment grade ratings.\nOn our last call we outlined getting to 12% comparable operating profit requiring delivering the balance of our $160 million in cost synergies, an additional 100 basis points of cost reductions and approximately 30 basis points of gross margin improvement. George outlined the operational actions we are taking to get to the 12% goal. I will highlight how those actions will translate to our financials.\nWhile some of these cost reductions were contemplated in our original synergy assumptions, we are taking out more than originally anticipated to get an additional 100 basis points out. We expect to realize the majority of these cost reductions and margin enhancements in 2016. We are going beyond our original G&A work to further simplify our administrative cost structures. To this end, as George noted, we recently completed a meaningful head-count reduction across our corporate support centers. Additionally, we are executing broad-based reductions across all our non-selling functional areas and discretionary costs within our support teams across the enterprise. We estimate the savings generated through these head-count reductions and other G&A cost reduction initiatives will reduce our costs by approximately 45 basis points to 55 basis points on an annualized basis with the vast majority of the savings to be realized in 2016.\nNote that savings realized from actions taken in 2015 are already included in our most current 2015 annual outlook. Additionally, the one-time costs resulting from the recent head-count support center reduction is already included in our most recent full-year 2015 estimate for one-time costs. As George shared, we have taken steps to improve our productivity and profit contribution across our store base with our ongoing performance management discipline and efforts to simplify our store operations. While performance management will improve many of our outlier stores, closing stores is required on the chronic, underperforming and unprofitable stores.\nAs part of our ongoing assessment of consistent recurring outliers, we are now applying a higher threshold of performance acceptability, and while this work is not yet complete, we have made the initial decision to close 50 of our poorest performing stores by the end of 2015 that were not originally anticipated. This is in line with our focus on minimizing distractions and removing layers of low-returning costs and focus on our highest-returning activities. The one-time costs associated with these additional closures are estimated to be between $16 million and $20 million and will be incremental to our original 2015 full-year outlook for one-time costs. We will share more details on any further closures as we continue our work.\nAll in, we estimate the annualized benefits from improving our store profitability and productivity through performance management, operating efficiencies and store closures is estimated to deliver expense leverage of approximately 45 basis points to 55 basis points in 2016.\nLastly, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue expanding our gross margin rate. We expect to leverage our size and scale to drive incremental net gross margin expansion, ex-synergies, through improved purchasing, growth of our private label program and our global sourcing initiatives. We also expect benefits driven from supply chain initiatives longer term led by our daily delivery program expansion. Shorter-term, we expect to offset the incremental costs and investments to expand our daily delivery through initiatives such as greater efficiencies across our transportation program and improvements in supply chain productivity.\nAdditionally, on supply chain, we have largely completed our distribution network go-forward plan and roadmap. However, we are still working through the financial implications and complexities of the acquired Carquest distribution network, including working through matters with distribution center landlords. We'll provide you more details as we finalize this work.\nIn addition to improving our operating performance, a material opportunity exists to improve our working capital. We continue to see opportunities to improve our AP ratio through better terms and improved inventory management as we progress through the product conversion and supply chain work. We're on pace to pay down debt by the end of 2015 and get back to a sustained leverage ceiling of 2.5 times and maintain our strong investment grade rating. Once achieved, we will revert back to our previous capital allocation strategy to drive shareholder value, which includes investing in our business and deploying our share buyback program.\nTurning to the back half of the year, we are maintaining our annual outlook that we shared with you on our Q1 2015 earnings call, which includes delivering a full-year comparable cash EPS outlook of $8.10 to $8.30. As shared earlier in my remarks, we now expect one-time costs to increase $16 million to $20 million with the additional 50 store closures. This increases our 2015 full-year estimate for one-time costs from our original outlook of $75 million to $85 million to now be between $91 million and $105 million.\nIn closing, our second quarter results were in line with our original expectations as we made progress in our base business and integration. We remain optimistic and focused on driving our commercial sales growth, steadily improving our DIY business, and executing on our actions to achieve our 12% comparable operating profit target. I would like to finish by thanking our team members once again for what they do every day to serve our customers, inspire our team members and grow our company.\nOperator, we're now ready for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Mr. Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Sir, your line is open.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.\nThank you and good morning.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHi, Seth.\nDarren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director\nHey, Seth.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.\nMy first question is just a clarification of 2015 guidance. I want to make sure that some of the extra savings that you guys are now talking about were included in the 2015 outlook previously.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Seth. It's Mike. Yes, we were \u2013 if you look at our guidance for the year, it's $8.20 kind of take the middle of that range we gave of $8.10 to $8.30, so use $8.20. And then that included about $20 million of Hartford annualization from last year and acceleration of Worldpac. So if you adjust for that, you get an increase in EPS of somewhere between 10% and 11%. And then if you take the midpoint of the synergies that we planned this year, that explains about half of it. If you do use the midpoint of 45 basis points to 55 basis points which means the base business was increasing.\nSo we actually assumed that we would improve our base business and those things that we talked about in our script in terms of improving our SG&A and some of the other aspects of improvements are part of that improvement in the base business this year. So the answer is yes.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.\nGot it. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, just thinking a bit about the DIY business, you mentioned sequential improvement. Can you point to whether or not we saw positive comps from that business yet and what the drivers of improvement are and how you expect it to trend going forward?\nDarren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYes, Seth. This is Darren. So in my prepared remarks I said the DIY business approached flat. So it's been the best DIY performance that we've probably had in nearly a year and a half. And the drivers are what George outlined. We're real pleased with the Speed Perks program and the loyalty program and we continue to build that membership. It's over 6 million. The other things that we have put a fair amount of time and energy into, we talked about our omni-channel capabilities. We like that business in terms of the synergy we're seeing in terms of moving traffic into the store. And then some of the marketing efforts are paying off in some of the key markets and we're starting to see some of the benefits that we haven't seen in years as we open new stores in new greenfield markets. That tends to be a little bit of a flywheel as that builds. I mean it's not going to be a big deal right now. But over the next several years as we start to push stores out west, that will be part of it.\nSeth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.\nGot it. Thank you very much and good luck.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Mr. Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nThank you. Good morning, guys. You've previously mentioned that you needed some improved comp growth to get to your 12% EBIT target in 2017. So I guess the question is what are you guys assuming your comps need to be in 2016 to reach that 12% target? And just to be clear, this is 12% for the full year in 2016 and not a run rate by the end of 2016, correct?\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nHey, Scot. It's George. You're correct. It is the full year for 2016 that we're targeting toward. We've previously guided our comps to be in the low-single digits. We're sticking with that. I mentioned in my remarks that we're pleased with the start that we've had to Q3 and that also remains the fact. If you look at the 12% work, I think it's a culmination of a couple activities that we've talked about in the past. First of all, 18 months into the integration, we're always going look at head-count synergy; 18 months into the integration, we're looking market-by-market.\nSo as we look at our consolidation, conversion and relocation work, it became natural over time to begin to look at the Advance stores as part of that as well. And the same business rationale that we would have for consolidating a Carquest store or closing a Carquest store applies to an Advance Auto Parts store as well. So call that kind of an evolution of that activity. And then we stated that we were going to look for some costs out our business, and that was going to help guide us to 12%. We've found ways to accelerate that. So while looking at the synergy head-count, we looked deeper. We looked at ways to simplify the business for our teams. We looked at taking layers out of our corporate structure that would allow us to stop sending so much change to our stores and put more control around that. Culmination of all those things just led us to believe that we could get there considerably faster.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, and as for the sales, Scot, I'd say it's pretty straightforward. We do need to see the sales continue to make their upward progression. We're not going to jerk the wheel here. As George and his team have been essentially clearing the deck for the activities for our store, this progression \u2013 DIY got better last quarter, it got better this quarter, we expect it to get better next quarter. Our commercial business and our AAP stores got better this quarter. We have some work to do in our Carquest legacy stores. They will get better. They have probably the brunt of the intensity of the integration change, so we're not planning on a quantum leap in the comp store sales to get there, but we are planning on this progression into this methodical focus to get there over the next six quarters.\nScot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nExcellent. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nThanks. Good morning.\nDarren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director\nHi, Simeon.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Simeon.\nSimeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nMy first question is, just last quarter the outlook was lowered and we mentioned 12% for 2017. My question is why raise the bar now? It wouldn't have \u2013 better progression may be to beat along the way next year and that begs a follow-up of 12% wouldn't seem like a stopping point to your point, Darren. I'm curious about your thoughts, just why now?\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nWell, I'll start off with the why say 12%. Because we think we have a clear pathway there. So again, as we began the work and as we \u2013 the sales have to continue to grow. We've said they would. But as the integration begins to abate more and more quarter by quarter, we know that the primary effect of the integration has been on the Commercial business. We'll see the Commercial business strengthen along the way. We also find some significant cost-out opportunity across the board that we now feel very strongly that we can achieve this number and we'll do so in the six-quarter period to get there.\n12% is simply the next step along the way. So we're saying it because we have a clear pathway. We're not in any way, shape implying that that is what we're capable of doing. We actually believe we're capable of doing more than that.\nSimeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nOkay. And my follow up, thinking about share gains and top line growth versus margin. The industry is clearly strong right now and there's a lot of top line opportunity for your business, Worldpac, cross-selling and some of the better availability. So how do you balance the opportunity for market share gains with this margin target that you laid out there? Could that margin focus cause you to miss some opportunities on the top line or prevent you from going after some?\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Simeon, I'd frame it this way is, you're right. The market out there is very strong. If you think about our growth drivers, and you mentioned it on the call, Worldpac. Worldpac is a business that, to be honest, we're just not touching them. We will open another distribution center for Worldpac in the fourth quarter. They've opened six branches so far this year. They will finish with 12. Bob and his team continue to be missioned with grow that business profitably and as quickly as you can without affecting the base business, because you can take a business and grow it too fast and disrupt the base business is one.\nContinue to focus on new markets in terms of other growth opportunities, but do it in the right way. And we've targeted Texas in terms of growing our new store base out there and other parts out west. Keep taking advantage of those new markets in the core, I think as George has alluded to, each quarter \u2013 I think, George, you call it quieting the integration \u2013 how do we quiet the integration in a way that we continue to make steady progress on DIY, steady progress on the core Commercial, and really help the teams that are suffering the brunt of the integration in terms of product and people, continue to make their path forward in terms of normal selling routines.\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nAnd, Simeon, the moves that we've made so far and the ones that we referred to in our script are G&A heavy, S light. So we are not going to try to get our way there by affecting sales capability. That absolutely has to remain strong for us. In fact, we need to try to find ways to do more and more for the sales force, and I actually think the G&A cuts encourage sales.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd, Simeon, the other piece of that is the stores that we've closed help us both \u2013 the chronic underperformers are delivering negative comps. And when you close those stores that actually helps us on the top line. And actually they delivering negative profit, it actually helps us on the bottom line. So as George says, and I think it's an important point, this 12% is linked; top line growth and bottom line improvement.\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nAnd let me add, when you close stores that are underperforming, you're also helping out BS (38:09) once again. So how does that play out for a district manager? An underperforming store is much like any performance management issue. You spend a disproportionate amount of time and effort trying to fix that store, resuscitate that store, and maybe that's not even possible. So this frees up the time and the bandwidth for our district managers to go encourage the best-performing stores and move along the middle performing stores.\nSimeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nOkay, thanks.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Mr. Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.\nGregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI\nHi, thanks. I wanted to get in a little more about the real incremental store closures. Could you give us more \u2013 it sounds like they were just poorly performing stores. Were they geographically in a certain area, or were they burning cash, or what were the metrics used to actually pick those 50 stores?\nDarren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director\nWe looked at the four-wall profitability of the stores, Greg, and I think that really drove the answer. They're geographically spread. I think when you have a chain the size of ours, 5,300 stores, over time demographic shifts, business shifts, and I think that's simply the case with these stores. So they've been around for a while. They've begun to decline. Their comps were going down, their operating income was going down, and this was just the right decision for us to make. And I wouldn't suggest that we're finished. It's an ongoing process. We should always be looking at the performance of our stores and we should always be paring away those that are weaker.\nGregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI\nGot it. And then on the capital allocation, I think, Mike, you mentioned that once you get the debt paid down and get down to under 2.5 times debt to EBITDAR that you go back to the traditional capital allocation strategy. Could you remind us of what that is? And also if I remember correctly it tended to bounce around between maybe 1.8 times and 2.4 times debt to EBITDAR. Could you just remind us what that was and how you look at it now?\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, so the answer is, yes. We'll go back to our previous capital allocation. And that was always investing in the business first and then our share buyback program. We always had an open to buy. Currently we have an open to buy. We've made a commitment to the rating agencies that we'll be below our 2.5 times, and that's what we're committed to. And then the other thing I'd remind you of, we recently got an upgrade from Moody's. So, I think those are all positive. That doesn't change the commitments we've made. We're going to keep under our 2.5 times. And then we'll use our share buyback as we've used it historically.\nGregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI\nGreat. Thanks.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYep.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Mr. Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Sir, your line is open.\nDan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\nThanks. George, I wanted to follow up on your comments about the Carquest stores generating commercial comps a little less than expected. Is that primarily reflecting their lower pricing or the price of realignment that you referred to? And not yet generating higher revenues or do you think it was perhaps the loss of some of their brands such as Wix and Gates that's impacting their performance?\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nDan, I think you hit the primary one. When you look at the pricing strategy work that was done and we got to what we consider to be competitive pricing in the commercial business across the country, the majority of the price decrease work went toward the Carquest stores, which were historically higher in price. As we've said that price change is immediate but velocity growth is not. So, it takes a bit of time to get the word out to go from customer-to-customer and begin to get the realization that there is a more competitive price in the market before we begin the see the sales lift. So I think we attribute the majority of it to that.\nDan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\nI also wanted to follow up on your comments about do-it-yourself comps getting close to flat. And it sounds like you're off to a good start with the loyalty program. But it looks like there's one other initiative the company hasn't yet implemented to drive do-it-yourself revenues and that's an expanded private label program. Is your private label penetration still in the low-20% rate? And if so, do you see a need to bump it up to the level that AutoZone and O'Reilly are currently running to achieve similar type of do-it-yourself productivity?\nCharles E. Tyson - EVP-Merchandising, Marketing & Supply Chain\nHey, Dan. This is Charles. Good morning.\nDan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\nHi, Charles.\nCharles E. Tyson - EVP-Merchandising, Marketing & Supply Chain\nWe've been working on our private label development program now for four years and when you look at the expansion of the Carquest program across our whole network, today we said it was a combined company of 47%. So we made significant progress improving our private label penetration.\nDan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\nSo in the Advance stores, 47% of the cost of goods sold is now private label or...\nCharles E. Tyson - EVP-Merchandising, Marketing & Supply Chain\nCombined company, we're not breaking it out between AAP and Carquest; when you look at the combined stores, if you start to walk through the AAP stores you'll start to see a fairly significant penetration of the Carquest private label brand sitting in that base business. And as we roll through the product changeovers this year, and the lift and replace, you'll continue to see the Carquest penetration improve in the AAP buildings.\nDan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\nJust one more follow up, then is that private label product from Carquest desirable for the do-it-yourself customer who I typically think is looking for that opening price point.\nCharles E. Tyson - EVP-Merchandising, Marketing & Supply Chain\nSo, as we lean into our heavy DIY program, particularly with our Speed Perks program, we're seeing very good adoption of the Carquest brand to those heavy DIYers. So they want both a value brand, which we've seen historically that we've driven on the AAP side, but we're seeing very good take up with the quality of the Carquest private label across multiple categories, Dan.\nDan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Sir, your line is open.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank\nGood morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The closure of the 50 incremental stores begs the topic of what the potential opportunity from this strategy might be along with how you're thinking about the potential for sales recapture from those 50 closed stores. So how many of the stores across your entire base right now are unprofitable?\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nWell, we're addressing those within this closure.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank\nOkay.\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nWe're addressing the unprofitable stores within the closure. As for what the total number is we're still \u2013 that's ongoing analysis, we'll continue to work on it. We'll always work on it. But I would add that in some cases there will be consolidation opportunity as well as part of this. So, we don't look at it necessarily as a complete sales loss. We look at it in many cases as profit optimization.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Michael, the other thing I would add as well is there were three dimensions to improving the profitability that we talked about. One is performance management. And whenever you have stores, sometimes there's points and periods of time where stores run a little lower comp or are unprofitable in a certain period of time and those can be solved with performance management or as George said, simplifying our operation. And then the third dimension is, and that's the last resort of closing stores. So it's those three things that we look at across and all three of them will drive improvement.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank\nMike, do we think about the distribution of your stores by profitability as maybe more uneven than the average retailer? So you have a good amount of very profitable stores and then more at the tail of those that are unprofitable?\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNo. I wouldn't say \u2013 we have 5,300 company owned stores, and I would say we're no different than a lot of other retailers, because you're going to have variability. We just completed an acquisition; we've got some newer stores to our portfolio. But I would say we're no different than any other retailers. You get variability and you address those variability. And that's what we're doing as part of our efforts.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank\nOkay. And then if we look at the gross margin performance in the second quarter it was up nicely. How much of that was due to the synergies that accrued during the period?\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, that was the biggest driver of the improvement in our gross margin.\nMichael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank\nOkay. Thank you so much.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYep.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nThanks a lot. First just a quick quantitative housekeeping item. Because you didn't have 2016 guidance out there previously, just to clarify, it seems like the acceleration on the margin side is about 50 basis points from the original plan. Is that, Mike, the right way to think about it?\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYou know what? We haven't put it out there yet. I think George said it earlier, in Q3 we'll give you a clue like we typically do with how we're thinking about next year, and then we'll give you the actual outlook in Q4. I don't want to get into that for next year, but the fact of the matter is for the full year next year we're expecting to grow on this year and we're expecting the margins to come in at 12%.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGot it. I was just using the 45 basis point to 55 basis point quantification that you gave for some of the expense line items that you itemized...\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, we actually gave two.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nOkay.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe gave 45 basis points to 55 basis points for G&A and we also gave 45 basis points to 55 basis points in terms of the closure of our stores.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGot it. So those were two different ones. And both of those, just to be clear, are incremental to your prior thinking?\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Yep.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nOkay. Thank you. And then second question...\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSorry, Matt, those are incremental to what we would expect for this year. Some of that was already built into our synergies, but they're incremental to this year.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGot it. Okay. So the acceleration by year, we probably can't pinpoint exactly how much you've pushed forward from your prior plan to your new one? Not at this point?\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, you know what happens, Matt, is originally when we did our synergy work you do it based on targets. Now we're getting to more street addresses and that's how we think about it. So, they start to blur together. Here's how I'd have you think about it. This year we've given you an outlook for this year for $8.10 to $8.30, that's how we think about this year. And then next year we're going to build on that and hit 12% operating profit. That's how I'd have you think about it.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nAnd just one more piece of clarity. On this quantitative side, it sounds like the acceleration, the 12% is not just pushing up the timing of recognizing synergies that you'd previously disclosed, but in addition to that some other cost cuts that you discussed on the call. Is that correct?\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nThat is correct, Matt. It reflects a deeper work than the synergy.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGot it. And then just briefly on the qualitative side, you made reference earlier in the call, guys, to moving to more of a field-driven organization. Can you talk about how you implement that, how you deploy that strategy, I guess, on the cultural front, which seems to your point to be an opportunity for the stores?\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nYeah, Matt. I think it begins with, again, simply beginning to put some significant governance and gatekeeping in place and the communication is coming out of the SSC. It also involves becoming a better listening organization. So, we've already begun to do things like General Manager Councils that actually have some real consequence to them where a group of just great performers from around the country begin to come in and give us advice on what needs to be done to change the business. We now run all field changes past the field leadership team or a sampling of the field before we actually go ahead and we make those changes. We give more decision-making autonomy to the field senior leadership and ask them to take a bigger role in driving the outcome of our business.\nWe've made a significant effort at trying to just dismantle the bureaucracy of our company. And we have it like any other that when you get big over time, you get some unintended consequences. So beginning to pull that out and just begin to simplify our message to the team and mean it much more on what we say. This business ownership and accountability for our field team, we've simplified our field structure. We have said certainly that we feel that we need to go to a single selling team in our stores. We've had the historical DIY and commercial split. We know that we need to begin to unify that and operate as one single selling team.\nSo, I think there are a number of initiatives ongoing and certainly planned that we've begun to put in place that will begin to drive that kind of behavior. And it really begins to shift the decision-making weighting more toward the field team and away from the corporate team. We know there are things that we think can affect our business that will put an entrepreneurial spirit in the stores. Among those things are how we incent our team, so we're going to pilot and try those things as well. And most of the change in this organization going forward will be led by our field teams, piloted by our field teams and rolled off by our field teams, not tops down.\nMatthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Mr. Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.\nMark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nHi. It's actually Mark Becks on for Chris.\nDarren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director\nHi, Mark.\nMark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nMy first question is on the loyalty program and Speed Perks. Can you give us a sort of idea on the lift that you're seeing? And then also if there's any affiliated gross margin impact or maybe that's just a shift of advertising dollars? And then I have a follow up as well.\nDarren R. Jackson - Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah, Mark, historically we don't hand out the lift numbers and I'd say the other \u2013 but I would say this is that if you asked us point blank, what's underlying your shift in terms of positive momentum in DIY, it is Speed Perks. You know what? We're seeing excitement with our team members. When your team members can actually provide something to your customers that they're excited about, provide a benefit to your customers, that's what's driving part of the 6 million memberships that we're seeing today. Is there a margin cost for this? Of course it is. It's not material in the scheme of things given DIY margins overall, but there is a small cost to it in the margins that we're seeing.\nMark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nOkay. And this is my second question on the daily delivery and fulfillment. I think you guys are at 777 stores now you said and going to 1,000 stores by yearend. Can you guys give us an update on how many of your DCs are actually have the capabilities for daily fulfillment or replenishment and then how you view that increase going forward? That would be helpful. Thanks.\nCharles E. Tyson - EVP-Merchandising, Marketing & Supply Chain\nHey, Mark. This is Charles. So today, we've got three of our AAP legacy DCs that are doing daily delivery across all of the Carquest DCs are daily delivery today, which we will continue to make investments in the AAP buildings to build out and complete our 5X delivery across our whole network. We will add capability in the fourth quarter of this year to enhance moving beyond that 1,000-store number. And we will continue to drive additional capability into converting three more of the legacy DCs next year to expand on our 5X capability.\nMark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nSo, if I got my numbers right that would only leave another two or three legacy Advance DCs for daily delivery. Is that correct?\nCharles E. Tyson - EVP-Merchandising, Marketing & Supply Chain\nThat's correct. That would leave two more that we would be working on in 2018 in our current plan.\nMark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nPerfect. Thanks a lot.\nOperator\nOur final question today comes from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.\nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nThanks. So question for George, you said that this second quarter was the second quarter of heavy lifting and then that should dissipate from here. So is there any way to quantify where that disruption occurred in the first quarter and then quantify in the second quarter and what it will look like in the third quarter and fourth quarter? Does it show up in sales, SG&A, margins, et cetera, any way to sort of help us quantify what that looks like?\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nYeah, I mean, I think we would see the intensity of the integration abate sequentially through all four quarters of this year. So, if you go back to the first quarter of the year, we had changed the field organization. We had changed some selling team responsibilities, some customers had been realigned among our sales team. We were at the peak of price changes across getting to one set of prices across both Advance and Carquest. We were at the peak of the product lift strategy, relabeling which is essentially completed now. It was in full swing during the first quarter. So that was kind of the high watermark in terms of all the activities starting in the same place.\nIf you move into Q2, as we finished Q2, again, the relabeling work is done. But Carquest still goes on, but it's become more manageable. Our teams are six months more experienced enrolled (56:04) than they were when we started this, so the relationships are getting stronger, and that impact on the commercial business begins to lessen. That plays forward into Q3 and Q4. So, we see Q2 as having been better than Q1, and Q3 is going to be better than Q2 was.\nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nRight. And so understanding that, any way to quantify how that might show up in the P&L?\nGeorge E. Sherman - President\nNo. I think, again, we've said that we saw some sequential progress from Q1 to Q2 in sales, mentioned that we were pleased with the start to Q3. We'd expect that to continue.\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd it's built into our annual outlook.\nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nOkay. If I could ask two more quick follow-ups, because I know we're getting close to 11 a.m. here. One, the 200 stores in consolidations, conversions, et cetera, does that include the 50 stores you're talking about today? And then can you sort of break out how many of those will be consolidations versus closures versus conversions, et cetera? Just so we can sort of calculate in our model, your yearend store count?\nBill Carter - Senior Vice President, Business Development and Integration\nSo, this is Bill Carter. The 50 incremental closures that Mike and George mentioned are on top of the 200 stores that we'll do TCRs (57:17) and we'll do in the back half of this year. What I'd say in terms of breaking out those 200 in terms of conversions, consolidations and what we'll call relocations is if we go back to the bigger picture, we're about a one-third, a one-third, a one-third between conversions, consolidations and relocations across the Carquest chain and we're largely sticking with that allocation. We'll do more conversions and consolidations earlier because the relos take a little bit longer to work through the system. So, as I look at the 200 stores, it's probably 40/40/20 stores in terms of breaking out how many of those are conversions versus consolidations versus relocations.\nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nOkay, helpful. One more quick one. You reiterated your low single digit guidance during the Q&A session here. But I think the guidance as of last quarter was the low end of the low single digit comp guidance. So, are we still thinking low end of the low single digit?\nMichael A. Norona - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, we are.\nMike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nOkay. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nAt this time, there are no further questions. I will turn the call back to Zaheed Mawani for any final comments.\nZaheed Mawani - Vice President, Finance Planning, Analysis and Investor Relations\nThank you, Cheryl, and thanks to our audience for participating on our second quarter conference call. That concludes our call. Thank you.\nOperator\nThat concludes your call today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining us.\n\n",

Also during the question-and-answer portion of our call, our regional management team will be available to answer questions as well. \nI would now like to turn the call over to Mort Zuckerman for his formal remarks.\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nGood morning, everybody. We continue to find that our basic strategy, I guess, is the only way to put it, is holding up very well in what we think are fairly weak economic times in a macro sense. And we continue to believe that we'll continue to do well in this environment, simply because the quality of the buildings and the quality of the locations in the markets that we are in are doing relatively better than the overall economy. And we suspect that this is going to continue so we're actually feeling reasonably optimistic about our business. But I have to say, I have been relatively bearish about the economy, and I continue to be that way because I think the overall macro numbers are quite weak, especially the employment numbers. The employment numbers in the first 3 months of this year were very weak because, let me put it this way, they looked better than they really were because of the way the government counts these numbers when they're so called, seasonally adjusted. Well, the fact that we have the warmest pretty months since 1895, an average of 6 degrees per day warmer than and any period going back to 1895. And this means that we basically saved a lot of jobs. People are able to get to work, certain kinds of work like construction was able to continue in the warmer weather, et cetera. The same thing is true in agriculture.  \nSo we're in a situation where the economy overall, remains weak. Nevertheless, the areas in which we service, tenants, by and large have continued to be well, relatively well. Certainly, if you look at the markets we are in, they are all still doing fairly well in terms of the kind of space that we offer to the market, which is as we always say in the order of clich\u00e9s, they're A buildings in A locations. And we have really worked very hard to maintain that particular niche in the marketplace and it has served us well in each one of the markets we are in, whether it's Boston or Cambridge, New York, San Francisco, Washington. Now these are the markets that have continued to do well, and I think it shows up in the earnings that we have. The question that we always ask ourselves is, how do we continue to grow the business? And we are in the process of doing either additional acquisitions or we have development that are underway. We have a major development in New York, for example, and we just completed a meeting in which we were going over the tenancy. This is under construction as we speak. We bought a building in Boston that you all probably know, 1,300,000 square foot building. Now these are a couple of the major transactions we have underway, and we're always in the marketplace for buildings that fit into our definition, shall we say, about the kinds of buildings we want to own. And we think we're going to be able to continue to do well because we are relatively conservatively financed. We have access to capital on terms that frankly have not been available to anybody in the real estate business since I have been in the business, which I'm embarrassed to say, goes back 51 years. So that is, in a sense, the comparative advantage for us, making it possible for us to make acquisitions or to continue development and to be able to come out with yields that we're comfortable with.\nSo we're not in an exuberant time, but we think we can continue to prosper in these times because of the unique strategy, because of the credibility we have in the markets we are in, because of our ability to finance whatever we do and because of the ability of every single one of our offices to generate both additional acquisitions, additional sites and additional centers. \nSo with that, I'll just turn it over to Doug Linde, who will go through our earnings and then we'll just open it up to questions.\nDouglas T. Linde\nThanks, Mort. Good morning, everybody. So when I start to think about the first quarter, when you look at the macro data and you looked at what was going on with the announcement of the LTRO in Europe, I think everyone's sort of had a perspective that things were going to do -- be pretty good. It's not robust in the first quarter. I think the data around the real estate markets really was sort of out of sync with those expectations. There really wasn't the same pattern. \nThe way we would describe things are that the real estate markets have been okay. They haven't been good, but they haven't been bad either. One of the brokers in New York City that we spent a lot of time with said, if you were to pick a color for the market, he would use the color gray for midtown. In other words, there's not much upper pricing on rents, but the pessimists aren't winning the day either. It's just sort of a status quo. There's still some Redskin. There's uncertainty with regards to what's happening with the large financial institutions as we're seeing on a daily basis, and no one's really making bold moves, but as you've heard from some of the previous calls you hear from us today, some of the larger tenants in the market are making decisions because they have lease expirations or they want to get on with life. \nSo as we think about our portfolio, for the most part we are in what I would refer to as a lease expiration driven market. But there are some pockets of growth and there are companies that are looking for some additional space, and they are impacting our portfolio and we'll talk about these in a couple of minutes.\nBut let me just give a little bit of color on each of the markets and what our activities are. So in midtown Manhattan, it was really a pretty below-average quarter. We were probably off about 15% in terms of the overall leasing activity. If you'll sort of look back to pre-Lehman Brothers in 2007, and there was a very modest increase in availability. For us, since the beginning of the year, we've done 6 more leases at 510 Madison Avenue, totaling about 44,000 square feet. Again, that's a lot of leases, but they're relatively small in terms of square footage per lease because of the size of the building. \nOur asking rents continue to be exactly where we pegged them last quarter. We're in the mid-90s at the base of the building and we're asking over $130 at the top. Over at 399, we have 6 floors of availability. That\u2019s being price in the 90s. And actually much to our positive surprise, we've had a significant amount of activity around those floors, and we actually have 4 deals that are ongoing where we're moving from proposals to lease negotiations.\nThe high-end midtown leasing overall, which is really what we focused on, which are where we define as sort of deals over $90 a square foot, it's really running in about the same pace as it was in the first quarter of 2011, which is about 400,000 square feet. So things are consistent there. As Mort described, the 250 West 55th Street, we have engaged in a number of discussions with tenants, and these are tenants with -- that have lease expirations for 2014 or 2015, sizes between 200,000 and 250,000 square feet. The building is going to be topped off in a couple of weeks, but we don't have anything signed yet. So I don't want to put too much emphasis on that. I will say though, as a side note, which is not insignificant, we did execute a 500,000 square-foot lease last night or yesterday in the morning with Citibank. As you can expect [ph] it's an extension at 601 Lexington Avenue through 2026 and it's the low rise of that building. Citi's lease was scheduled to expire in 2016 and they have made the decision to consolidate much of their midtown requirement in 601, and they are physically rebuilding the space as we sit here today.\nDropping down to D.C. area. Northern Virginia didn't have a terribly good month, negative absorption largely related to the BRAC relocations and new actual available inventory coming onto the market. Reston, once again, continues to be outlier. We've had consistent activity in our town center properties. Rents are still in the mid to high 40s in the urban core. Our availability is limited to smaller blocks of space and we continue to see good activity in those blocks of space. Just to give you a sort of a perspective economically and what's going on in a market like Northern Virginia, we are doing deals at One Freedom Square, and just to remind you, One Freedom Square was sort of our second generation building in the urban core. We did the Discovery building and then One Freedom Square then Two Freedom Square and then South of Market. So this is sort of an older building, relatively speaking. Well, rents are in the high 40s there. And if you go out to the Toll Road, you're lucky to see a face rent with a 3 in front of it, and on a net effective basis, is even lower.\nThe impact of the deficit negotiations and spending reductions and the election have made for a pretty soft demand environment in the district. We're just not seeing any real permanent activity. And the fiscal cliff that we're all looking at is clearly creating an environment where the procurement process is really, really slow. Just to again give you a sort of anecdotal example, we got a letter from the GSA for one of our buildings in the region that they wanted to expand into 17,000 square feet in September of 2011. As of today, we still sit with that space available without the actual signed extension from them. And each week, when we call them they say, well, we've got the approval. We just haven't been able to get it out the door yet. I mean, things are really, really contracting from a timing perspective in the district.\nOver the few quarters, there still have been more spaces coming out to the market due to law firm consolidation. And so there are more choices available for tenants. And we're really talking now about firms that have 2015 and 2016 lease expirations really driving the market. And those are the tenants that hopefully we're going to be able to lay in for 601 Madison Ave. If we get a pre-commitment [ph] , we're going to start the building probably towards the end of '13 or early '14. For us again, I think we're an outlier in D.C. Our portfolio is 98% leased and we've got less than 150,000 square feet of expiration in 2012. We don't think we're going to see much in the way of improvements in the market in '12 or '13. Rents are really still pretty flat into the high $40s on a triple net basis. You might get $50 a square foot on the best, best space in the market. But most of the leasing that we're going to see is probably going to be in the high $30s to the mid-$40s on a triple net basis. And again, not really -- we are really not looking for any sort of improvement in fundamentals in the district until well into 2013.\nIn the short-term, the private sector leasing continues to be slow as well. Our residential project, 50 Avenue [ph] , we are now 92% leased just over 10 months into the process, which is really, really a good sign for the property and the desire of people to want to locate over near DW.\nIn certain areas, however -- and again this is our portfolio and we're a little bit different, the government is in fact awarding contracts and leases are being signed. And that one of those areas is in the Cyber Security World and we happen to be building buildings up in and around Fort Mead. And we are the beneficiaries of one of those situations, where we've now signed a lease for 50% of our new building at Annapolis Junction. That's 120,000 square foot building. Then we did a contract with -- a lease with SAIC, who has a contract with one of the Fort Mead contracts. \nSo we are continuing to pursue those types of opportunities. We still are optimistic that we're going to have another defense-related user for our final building at Patriots Park. We hope that decision's going to be coming sometime in the second quarter of this year.\nPopping back up to Boston. Activity in Cambridge really is leading the Boston region. The technology and the life science tenants continue to expand and this market is tightening with improving economics. Vacancy rate in this Cambridge is well under 10%. Rents are in the low 50s and they probably increased 15% over the past 12 months. And there are really a very limited blocks of space above 100,000 square feet. For us, late last month, the city of Cambridge approved a 483,000 square foot expansion of our Cambridge Center complex, in conjunction with a major lease extension and expansion by Google. Google is one of our largest tenants at Cambridge Center, obviously. It's really a pretty interesting example of how our development team was able to work with both the tenant and the city to solve their long-term requirements. Google was looking for larger floor, place floors, and we came up with a solution whereby we could put connectors between a couple of our buildings in Cambridge Center and give them the connectivity and the floor plate [ph] they were looking for on our existing parcel. And so currently, Google occupies 144,000 square feet and they've agreed to take another 106,000 square feet of available space, or no longer available but was available, as well as occupying additional 43,000 square feet of space when we finally finish the building, and we hope to have that completed by the end of 2013. The full lease that Google is signing is going to run through 2025. We still have some permits to approve, but we're really optimistic about our opportunities in Cambridge. And we've also completed another 70,000 square feet of leasing expansions by Microsoft and MIT and we're virtually out of space in Cambridge in our existing product.\nIn the Boston CBD, there was actually positive absorption this quarter. Quite frankly, it was due to one tenant moving from the suburbs of 128 into the Seaport District. And they really aren't in lot of 2012 or 2013 tenants in the market. So we don't really think there's going to be much in the way of significant changes in the overall vacancy factor in Boston in 2012. We did complete another floor at Atlantic Wharf so we're now 93% leased there. And we've leased 85 out of the 86 units at the lofts and that project opened in July. Those are apartments there. \nIn the Back Bay, again we don't have much in the way of availability. So we're really working on our forward leasing of 2013, '14 and '15. So we've done 100,000 square feet of forward leasing at the Hancock. I would expect by the end of this quarter, we'll have another 150,000 square feet of subtenants completed, forward leasing from -- in the Hancock. Those are all Manulife leases that expiring in '15. And we continue to work on some of the other larger expirations at both the Hancock and at 101 Huntington Avenue as approved. And we're very optimistic that we're going to have a couple more larger transactions to talk about as we move into the latter parts of this year. Rents from the Back Bay are pretty consistent still. They are in the low 40s at the base of some of these buildings to over $70 a square food at the tops. \nIn the suburban market, things again are good. They're not great. They're not bad. There's a good pace of organic growth from a bunch of small technology and life sciences companies, many you probably have never heard the names of. And since the beginning of the year, we've completed about 20 leases for just over 220,000 square feet of space in our suburban 128 portfolio, including a lease with New York Life to move into one of our Waltham properties. The tenant that's actually in that space is Microsoft, and they are going to be relocating and expanding at Cambridge Center, and New York Life's going to backfill their space. Availability is still in the mid-teens for the best space. So rents are going to be flat again, I think, high 20s to the low 30s for the best space, but it's still -- that's up about 15% from this time last year.\nMoving out west to the San Francisco. Things are still really robust out there. We see -- continue to see strong activity in the CBD, in the Peninsula and the Silicon Valley. It was probably the strongest quarter in the last 5 years in the city of San Francisco, and the 400,000 square-foot salesforce.com lease was probably the highlight. That was at 50 Fremont, which is a non-techie mark [indiscernible] building. It's a true traditional office building.\nSalesforce and a bunch of other technology companies continue to have a strong appetite for additional space. Vacancy rate is well under 10%, and I think the struggle now is that tenants who are just not able to find blocks of space in buildings that they would deem to be acceptable for long-term tenancies. And so I think the city is going to continue to get stronger and stronger. Availability in the market there is centered now 2% to 4%, so we just don't have any space. Our largest block is 43,000 square feet and we're actually trading proposals on that space. If you jumped down into the Peninsula, there's just very little in the way of available space in Palo Alto or Mountain View or Cupertino for that matter until what's going on is the demand is being pushed north and south. So overall vacancy rates are down probably between 400 and 500 basis points in the stronger markets of the Silicon Valley, and rents are up 15% to 20%. So we've done one additional deal over the past couple of weeks in Mountain View. That lease was 7% higher than the highest deal that we did in 2011.\nRents are moving really rapidly. R&D rents are in the high 20s, triple net and office rents in Mountain View and Palo Alto were an excess of $45 triple net. There's still another 9.5 million or 10 million square feet of active requirements. And Google and Apple, which are really the -- I think the two drivers from the large-users perspective; continue to look for additional space.\nIn the North Peninsula submarket, which is where we have our Gateway properties. We had 4 floors available at the end of the year. Two of those floors have been leased, and rents in that market are about $20 triple net for office space. You may recall that I mentioned last quarter sort of the haves and the have-nots and they were the building across from Gateway called Centennial Plaza, 320,000 square feet. It was completed 3 years ago and it had yet to sign its first lease. Well, as I said, things are just so strong that -- and things are moving so quickly, there's now a rumor that the first tenant has in fact committed to that project. And we are starting to see more and more speculative construction in Silicon Valley and places like Sunnyvale and Claremont. \nIn total for the quarter, as a company, we completed about 860,000 square feet of gross leasing activity and that includes the Mountain View assets. And it was below our typical quarter on a gross basis, but they actually encompassed 81 different transactions. So it was actually above our quarter in terms of sort of how you're looking on our average number of transactions over the number -- over the past few years. \nI think our second-generation rents need a little explanation this quarter. You'll notice that rather large number in New York City. First in Boston, MFS is moving into the property at the end of the year, but they took possession of the space in January. And so that lease is in place in Boston. And there, we're comparing the final rent of the banding [ph] lease with the initial rent of the 15-year lease with MFS. And in New York City, what's skewing the statistics is an FAO -- the FAO Scwartz Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us we successfully won in arbitration last year. So if you were to pull those two transactions out, the actual overall rental rate for our second-generation space is down somewhere between 3% and 4%. So it sort of mutes everything, if you take those two deals out and it's pretty flat.\nOne of Mort's favorite sayings is that repetition does not diminish the prayer. So I'm going to say once again that when you look at San Francisco, you're going to just see the roll down from those $98 leases that we signed at the height of the dot-com era. During 2001, rents at EC actually increased by more than 15% and we just completed a full-floor lease in the mid-70s on that EC 4 to sort of give you a comparison of how far back we've come from the lowest of the lows 3 years ago. Overall, our portfolio mark-to-market is about $1.10 per square foot. \nWhen we filed our 10-K late last month or actually in March, we announced our deal to purchase 100 Federal Street. I don't want to -- I thought I'd give you a little bit of color on that. So this transaction was completed on an off-the-market basis. An existing tenant in the building had a right to first offer, and we had a relationship with that tenant, which allowed us to exclusively negotiate a P&S agreement and a lease with Bank of America, the prior owner. 100 Federal Street has been controlled by BofA or its successor institution since it was built in 1971. We've outlined the near-term financial impact of the asset in our press release, so I won't bother going through that. But I did sort of want to describe some of the other attributes of the building. All of the major leases have contractual increases. The building sits on a 2-acre parcel across from Post Office Square. The building sits back from the street and has significant light and air surrounding. And if you do a tour of the Financial District CBD in Boston, you'll note that a lot of the buildings are tied up against each other, and 100 Federal Street is unique in its orientation.\nMany of the floors were built with extraordinary heights from a floor or floor basis because it was built as a headquarters for the Bank of Boston, First National Bank of Boston way back when, which means effectively that if you were sitting on the 19th floor behind the Federal Street, you're really sitting on the 24th -- or the 25th floor of another building. So our relative positioning in the marketplace is significantly better. The Bank of America leased 800,000 square feet, the entire low rise of the building, for 10 years. So we have two opportunities to take some space back from the bank in the low rise. They have the right to give back 2 floors, one in 2014 and then one in 2015. Interestingly, we actually think that the large floor place, given the height and the window line and the amount of light and air, will be really attractive to both traditional financial services tenants, as well as some of the non-financial services tenants that are starting to look at the Boston CBD as their home. As the bank's use of space evolves over time, we are pretty confident we're going to be able to work with the bank to create opportunities that are beneficial to both parties. In other words, we'll take space back and we'll be able to lease it at a premium to what the bank is paying. \nThe concourse of the building houses the cafeteria space that's equivalent in size to the food court of the Prudential Center and it's run as a building only-institutional food operation. We have the right to take that space back and operate it as a full-service food operation with third-party operators should we choose to do so. \nWe've also begun to investigate changes to the common areas that would be attractive to the entire population of tenants in the whole Post Office Square neighborhood. Since the building has been the headquarters location of BofA and its predecessor institutions, it has a really robust infrastructure, with redundant systems that makes it very attractive to tenants looking to locate critical operations in a building in the city of Boston. And while the building does have some non-debt bank tenants, the approach that the former owners took to leasing the building really limited the availability of space and the opportunity for tenants to locate there. Currently, there are 3 floors available, the 19th, the 30th and the 33rd, and we've just started to introduce the product into the marketplace and we're really getting good at reception.\nFinally, on the deal side, last night we signed a binding agreement to sell our Bedford Research Park. This is a property the Boston Properties has owned since its inception in 1970s. We've prepositioned the buildings between 2008 to 2011. They are solid R&D facilities. This is a two-story product. They're home to some young and growing organizations. And while the sale quite frankly is going to be dilutive on an FFO basis or an EPS basis, we felt it's going to be really NAV accretive for the portfolio and it was the right time to reduce our exposure to this product in that submarket. \nOne last thing before I turn the call over to Mike. I do want to acknowledge that Mitch Norville, our COO, has left the company after 28 years. He joined us in 1984 as an Assistant Development Manager and became our COO in 2005 and continued to play an important role in both our development activities in our regions and continued to help us with the refinement for our corporate sources [ph] integration. He's leaving a terrific, phenomenal staff behind, and so we're going to take some time to figure out what the optimal way is to reorganize around what his activities were before we make any additional employment decisions. \nAnd with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael E. LaBelle\nGreat. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug mentioned, we closed the acquisition of 100 Federal Street in Boston this quarter. And with no tenant [ph] on the building, the investor represents a highly accretive use for $615 million of our cash. \nWe also repaid a significant amount of outstanding debt during the quarter including $576 million of our exchangeable notes that were redeemable and $140 million expiring mortgage loan on Bay Colony Corporate Center.\nSo our cash at quarter-end is down after all those uses at $590 million. We also have virtually our full $750 million line of credit available. And after paying off one more loan, which is a $65 million loan on One Freedom Square that we paid off in April, we now have no remaining debt maturities in 2012. We do have our development pipeline to fund, which totals $1.8 billion. The pipeline has about $600 million remaining to spend over the next 3 years, net of capitalized interest, and we project $250 million of this will be sent over the last 3 quarters of 2012.\nSo although our liquidity is more than sufficient to manage our near-term obligations, we will continue to evaluate supplementing it as we look at the prospective investment landscape and our early 2013 debt maturities. \nAs we noted in our press release, we've issued approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock, raising $153 million of equity using our at the market equity program to maintain our well-balanced capital structure in conjunction with the 100 Federal Street acquisition. We're also consistently evaluating the debt market, particularly given the current rate environment. Our 10-year bonds are currently trading at spreads in the high 100s. And we can raise 10-year debt today below 4%. The banks are also actively looking to fund unsecured term loans to the REIT market, and a number of companies have closed 5- to 7-year bank term loans. This execution is also clearly available to us as well, but to date, the bond market has offered more attractive fixed rates and term flexibility.\nThe mortgage market is also active with the insurance companies, the banks, and CMBS originators all quoting new loans. For CBD properties in our asset class, the mortgage market is competitive with the bond market with 10-year fixed rate debt of approximately 4% or potentially lower. \nThe market for suburban properties is thinner and spreads are wider with more conservative underwriting. Overall, the capital markets are clearly open for us today. Should we elect to raise additional capital, it would be dilutive to our earnings though, until we're able to invest upon in new opportunities to our retired [ph] expiring debt.\nNow I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our first quarter earnings results. Last night, we recorded first-quarter funds from operation of $1.12 per share. This is in line with our guidance that we provided last quarter, although we had 3 unusual expenses totaling $9.7 million or $0.06 per share that we had not budgeted. Excluding these items and the contribution of 100 Federal Street, which was also not budgeted, our FFO would have been higher by $0.045 per share and exceeded our guidance. \nIn the portfolio, FFO was ahead of our projections by about $4 million. The contribution of 100 Federal Street, which was acquired in mid-March, added about $2 million. For the rest of the portfolio, rental revenue was in line but we had operating expense savings of nearly $5 million, about half of which was related to lower net utility costs due to the warmer than normal weather that we experienced in Northeast. This savings was partially offset by a $3.2 million noncash charge associated with modifying the straight lining for two ground leases. Our ground lease expense will revert back to its fourth quarter 2011 run rate going forward.\nOur termination income was on budget and included $2.6 million from Lockheed Martin at our Patriots Park complex. This is the last piece of termination income that we will book from this transaction as Lockheed has now moved out of both buildings that the DIA will occupy in the future. \nOur development and management services team income came in $1 million above budget, a combination of several leasing in our JV portfolio and better than projected service income in the New York City and Boston portfolios. \nOur JV portfolio generated $1.3 million of income above our budget. We completed an early renewal with one of the office tenants of the GM Building and increased the rent by over 50%, which we'll begin straight lining this quarter. We also experienced some expense savings, higher-than-projected service income, and Apple sales at the GM Building produced better-than-expected percentage rent. \nOur G&A expense came in $4 million higher than we projected. As we disclosed in our 8-K that we filed in February, and as Doug mentioned, our former Chief Operating Officer, Mitch Norville, announced his resignation from the company, which resulted in the acceleration of vesting of certain long-term incentive compensation, as well as some other cash payments that were not budgeted in our first quarter G&A. There were no other meaningful variances in our G&A expenses for the quarter.\nWe did, however, incur $2.1 million of unbudgeted transaction costs related to acquisition expenses associated with 100 Federal Street and other deal-pursued costs. \nIn addition, we reported a $17.8 million gain on forgiveness of debt this quarter. This gain is from the completion of the transfer of our Montvale Center property located in Gaithersburg, Maryland to the servicer of this loan and loan repayment. We were unable to come to terms for a loan restructuring, despite nearly a year of discussions and both parties determined that the best course of action was for the friendly transfer of the property. The gain impacts our net income, but it's not in our FFO because we don't include gains on sale of property in our FFO. Previously, Montvale was running at an FFO loss of about $1.3 million annually. \nOur FAD for the quarter was $120 million. It was negatively impacted by the leasing costs from a 300,000 square foot 15-year new lease at 111 Huntington Avenue that pushed our average transaction cost for the quarter to over $50 a square foot. This is also reflected though, in our longer than average lease link this quarter, which was 108 months versus 72 months for the prior 3 quarters. If you exclude this lease, our leasing cost would have averaged $32 a square foot, which is much more in line with a typical quarter.  Although lower than normal this quarter, FAD was still strong and it allows for retention of cash flow and solid dividend coverage metrics with a payout ratio of 77%. \nAs we look forward to the rest of 2012, the most significant change we have to our guidance is from the impact of the acquisition of 100 Federal Street, which is expected to add $30 million of FFO to the full year 2012 or $0.18 per share that was not previously budgeted. In the portfolio, we continue to be impacted by the transitionary revenue decline associated with the downtime between leases in San Francisco, where we've now re-leased all but 2 of the floors at EC 4 and 2 of the floors at Gateway. But rent on most of the space has yet to commence. As I mentioned earlier, Lockheed Martin has now moved out of 2 of the 3 buildings in the 700,000 square foot Patriots Park and they will vacate the third building at the end of May. One of the buildings will come back into service next month with the DIA taking occupancy, but the other 2 are expected to be down until 2013.\nAnd at 399 Park Avenue, we will get 150 square feet back this summer with the expiration of the WilmerHale lease. As Doug mentioned, the activity on the space is stronger than we expected with proposals on and nearly all of it. But we anticipate some downtime between leases. We're making progress with each of these, but they continue to contribute to our projection for lower year-over-year same store results. \nOur 2012 GAAP same store projections have improved from last quarter with the leasing of virtually all of our available spacing in Cambridge, where we project to start straight line rents this year, as well as the lease extension Doug mentioned with Citibank at 601 Lexington Avenue. We still project 2012 same store GAAP NOI to be down slightly from 2011 by 1% to 2%. Our cash same store NOI projection is unchanged from last quarter and down 1% to 2% from 2011. \nAs we anticipated, our occupancy improved by 70 basis points to 92.1% this quarter with gains in Boston at 111 Huntington Avenue and Atlantic Wharf. We continue to expect our occupancy to average between 91% and 93% for the year. \nThe 2012 NOI contribution from our developments is in line with our report last quarter at $65 million to $70 million, and that includes the contribution from Atlantic Wharf and 2200 Pennsylvania office and the related residential projects. We anticipate that our straight-line rents and our fair value lease revenue for the consolidated portfolio, including the developments, will total $85 million to $90 million for 2012. This is higher than last quarter and reflects the leasing in Cambridge and at 601 Lexington Avenue, as well as the addition of 100 Federal Street that adds $2.6 million to our straight-line rents and $2.8 million of noncash fair value rental income to our 2012 FFO due to the low market rents in the building.\nOur Cambridge Center Hotel had a strong quarter. RevPAR was up 14% from the first quarter last year and we're increasing its projected contribution modestly to $9 million to $10 million of FFO for the full year 2012. \nLooking at our JV portfolio, it beat our projection in the first quarter and we anticipate it will be moderately higher for the full year as well. For the full year 2012, we're projecting its FFO contribution to be $125 million to $130 million, including $54 million of fair value lease revenue and $8 million to $12 million of straight-line rents. \n\t\nOur 2012 projection for development and management services income is $27 million to $32 million, up $2 million from last quarter due to the better-than-projected first quarter results. \nFor our G&A expenses, we project 85% to $87 million for 2012. This is an increase of approximately $2 million, again reflecting the full-year impact of the variance in the first quarter.\nOur interest expense will be lower than our previous projection due to the extinguishment of our $25 million Montvale Center loan. And for the full year 2012, we expect our net interest expense to be $388 million to $393 million with capitalized interest for the year projected to be $40 million to $45 million.\nAs Doug detailed, last night we signed an agreement to sell our Bedford Business Park property for $62.8 million. We anticipate that the sale will occur in the second quarter of this year and project a gain on sale of approximately $38 million. The transaction is being structured as a 1031 exchange so the gain will not have an impact on our dividend distribution requirements. \nSo taking all of our assumptions into account, we are raising our guidance for 2012 funds from operations by $0.18 per share at the low-end to $4.83 to $4.93 per share. As I mentioned earlier, the big driver of the increase in our projections is the addition of 100 Federal Street to the portfolio, which adds $0.18 a share. Additionally though, we are projecting FFO from the rest of our operations to be up $0.11 per share from our guidance last quarter. However, it is offset by the $0.06 per share of unbudgeted unusual expenses that occurred in the first quarter as well as our recent equity raising activity, which is diluted by $0.03 per share to the year, and the perspective sale of Bedford Business Park, which is protected to cost $0.02 per share. \nFor the second quarter, we project FFO of $1.23 to $1.25 per share. The improvement in our second quarter projected FFO from the first quarter is due to the contribution of a full quarter from 100 Federal, the seasonality of our hotel and the normalization of our G&A run rate. \nThat completes our formal remarks. Operator, you can open the call for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nAnd your first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler.\nJordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\nI just wanted to dig in to 100 Federal real quickly. Is it -- was this transaction more of a function of availability and cost of capital right now? And -- or maybe could you just discuss sort of the long-term expected IRR and how it fits into sort of BXP strategy? And then the reason I asked is the strategy has been to -- on sort of the best buildings and the best markets. And while this is obviously a very high quality building and a good market, it seems like Cambridge and the Back Bay have been the stronger markets in Boston, and you already have quite a bit of a concentration there?\nDouglas T. Linde\nSure. So I want to answer you first -- the first comment to your question, which is absolutely not. This was not a question of well, we have the money and therefore we can just buy this building. That's about the farthest thing from our thinking that you could possibly imagine. 100 Federal Street is a building that we identified 5 years ago when we started looking at, what are the best buildings in Boston that we would want to own if they were available, and there were 4 or 5 other buildings in the downtown submarket that we would consider owning because we think they are terrific long-term buildings that are very attractive to tenants and may or may not have been terribly well maintained or marketed over the past decade, but that are long-term winners for the city of Boston. The transaction came about because we were aware of the right that the tenant had to the right to first offer and we were also aware that the institution at the bank was looking to potentially raise capital sell their assets and get out of the real estate business. And they are not a good owner, a third-party owner of real estate. I think they would acknowledge that themselves. We look at the deal as a good cash on cash return at an exceedingly low basis per square foot with opportunities to enhance the cash flow characters of the building both from rolling rents up, taking the space back from the bank over time as the bank sort of rethinks how it wants to use its office space in the city of Boston, changing the profile of the ground floor in the way that the pedestrian and the area of the buildings around it sort of react to the building. In other words, this -- there is no place for anyone to have lunch or breakfast other than a hotel within 2-block proximity of this building. And we did a 25,000 square-foot food court at the Prudential Center that does thousands of dollars of square foot, and there are lots and lots of people working in those buildings and we think this thing could be the center of that type of activity sometime down the line to the future. It has parking that was under-managed, so there's an opportunity to increase the cash flow there. And we think that the replacement cost and the ability for people to build buildings in downtown Boston are few and far between, and that this is a great basis with great views, with great window light, with great floor height, and that it's going to be a building that's really attractive to both financial services and as well as tenants who are not traditional office users in downtown Boston. It's a block from the Greenway, which is really I think the epicenter of where activities are going to be in the city for quite some time. And so we think it's a great real estate investment. From a return perspective, is this thing going to be a 6.5% IRR? A 7.5% IRR? An 8.5% IRR? I don't know. We did lots and lots of financial modeling. We felt really good about a relatively conservative view of assumptions and generating on a short-term basis IRRs that were in the high 6s or low 7s. And when we look at how we can finance this building, it's a very attractive use of capital and we think there's a lot of upside, and if cap rates don't compress and rents go up, it gets significantly higher. If rents really pop, it gets significantly higher. If cap rates compress, it gets higher. And we think there's relatively little downside and lots of opportunities for upside. So I'm -- and you can probably imagine, I'm bullish on the asset.\nJordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\nIt sounds like it. Mort, can I get your perspective on New York a little bit? It seems Doug characterized -- or a broker characterized it as gray. There seems to be some inertia among the larger tenants in the market, and even with yourselves with Citi, it wouldn't get the terms on it, maybe it will come later in the call, but it seems like the large tenants seem to be staying put at least in the last 3 to 6 months. Maybe your sort of comments around that?\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nWell, I'm not going to try and oversell this market. But I will tell you that we are building a building in New York City and we are talking to 3 or 4 major tenants in addition to the one that we already have signed. So there is a fair amount of activity in terms of large tenants looking for new space and looking for larger space. So again, I think we are in a situation where there's a lot of nervousness in the business community for all kinds of reasons, some of which we all are familiar with. But still, New York is still doing very well, very well. The vacancy pretty much is holding up in the kinds of space that we are in. The occupancy is getting a little bit better. The vacancies are very small. And we are frankly quite bullish with the right buildings for the right building sites. We are absolutely in the market because we think this is going to continue to be a very strong market. The overall economy here in New York, of course, is dominated not just by the area of the city that we are in, which is sort of the Upper East Side, if I could put it that way. But also, of course, what is in the southern part of the city, what\u2019s south of 23rd Street, we have just had a huge influx of a lot of the activities in the high-tech world. It's very, very strong. Rents have gone up dramatically in that part of the city and we are looking at it and so are others. But I think it's going to stimulate the overall business environment and financial environment in Manhattan. And I will tell you another thing that the city has done, which is really quite remarkable, and you may -- I'm sure I've heard about it. There is going to be a brand-new university, a high-tech university. This is going to be started in this city. It's a joint venture of Cornell University and a major Israeli -- it's basically sort of the -- Israeli MIT. It's called Technion. We'll have a combination of the 2 of them, are going to put together a wonderful source of the kinds of highly educated talents in the world of technology, engineering, mathematics, you name it. So I think this is another great plus for New York. That'll be a few years in the making, but for a lot of companies who are thinking in the long-term, I think there is going to be a continued confidence in the future, the economic future of New York. Now we've also been blessed by some rather effective leadership with the mayoralty Michael Bloomberg. That's coming to an end. We'll see who his successor will be, but I suspect that everybody will appreciate and recognize why the city did well under the kind of management that Bloomberg brought to the city. So I think we're in very, very good shape. And as markets go, this is still a market that I think we'll be very interested in just in terms of the development or acquisitions, you name it. I think the long-term viability of this market is just, if anything, going to grow proportionately or relatively to a number of other markets, it's certainly going to remain the major city for the headquarters city for many companies. So I remain very bullish about this market. Obviously, we're going to have ebbs and flows but I'll put it this way, the flows are going to be better and the ebb is going to be less serious than in almost any other markets than say, Washington, of which of course, has a unique set of circumstances. So I think this is -- remains a very, very attractive city to be a part of and to invest in and to acquire assets, and we're going to continue to try and do that. It's not easy because there aren't too many buildings that are for sale. We have -- we're working on a number of sites in New York for development and we expect that we'll be able to begin another one shortly, and there are just a lot of different opportunities in New York, I might add, including residential. The markets here are very strong. The city economy is very strong. So I remain very bullish about New York. And I think we have always done well here, and I think we're going to continue to do well.\nDouglas T. Linde\nJust before you take the next question, operator. Just when Mort says we're going to begin another development shortly, we're not talking about bringing another development in the next year or so. We're talking about looking at sites where there may be development opportunities in the foreseeable future.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Josh Attie.\nJoshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division\nWhat are your thoughts on BXP doing development in the San Francisco area? I know land is constrained in the city, but it looks like you have some land in San Jose. Is that something you're considering doing or that could make economic sense?\nDouglas T. Linde\nThe short answer is yes. The long answer is economic sense is defined as finding the right tenants at the right time or feeling comfortable enough with the speculative nature of where rents are going to be that the tenants will pay a strong enough return to make it economically attractive to do. We have a site on Zanker Road. We have a site on North First Street that we're trying to permit, and we also, quite frankly, are working on a couple of additional sites in the Mountain View area where we think we have an opportunity to build some more dense-related type of development, things that are not quite as urban. Suburban campus-like as what you typically find in the Mountain View, Palo Alto area and we're encouraged by our, at least our deal flow, in terms of seeing where sites are and trying to put deals together so that we might have something going sometime over the next year or so.\nJoshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division\nAnd a quick question on New York. You mentioned strong activity at 250 West 55th Street and also at 399 Park, what are some of the characteristics of the tenants you're speaking with? Maybe what industries do they operate in? And do you know if they're expanding or shrinking from where they are today?\nDouglas T. Linde\nI'll characterize it as follows. The tenants that we're talking to at 250 West 55th Street are primarily law firms and some established technology companies. For the most part, the law firms are either becoming more efficient and looking at the way we have designed 250 West 55th Street in terms of the floor place [ph] , the lack of columns, the million design, the amount of perimeter offices and things. They can take less space than they currently have. And the technology companies that were looking at or companies that are probably more expanding than contracting. At 399 Park, it's a very traditional Park Avenue-centric, asset manager, hedge fund investment advisors. And for the most part, all of those tenants are expanding granularly. So a tenant that might have 35,000 square feet of space will be looking for 39,000 square feet of space with the right to or obligation to take another 5,000 square feet or 10,000 square feet of space in 2 or 3 years, that kind of thing.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Jamie Feldman.\nJames C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nCan you talk a little bit more or talk a little bit about your latest thoughts on London and expanding overseas? We've heard your name attached to several buildings in the past quarter or so, but haven't seen anything happen.\nDouglas T. Linde\nSo let me -- I'll start and I don't know if Mort wants to add anything or not. We've looked at London. We've spent some time in energy and capital, investigating some assets. We haven't bought anything, and I'd say we're focusing our attentions right now on our core markets. It doesn't mean we won't continue to think about London, but at the moment, our focus is on the markets that we're currently located in.\nJames C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nOkay. And along those lines, can you talk about your current wish list? I mean, you mentioned the 100 Federal building you've been watching some time. What else is out there? Whether it's in maybe in special servicing or sellers that just haven't found religion on pricing yet? How deep is the pipeline that we may see for you guys over the next year or so?\nDouglas T. Linde\nWell, I -- the depth of the pipeline we have, and whether we can come to an agreement on the deals with areas sold is -- are 2 different questions. We have a very deep pipeline of assets in Manhattan, in Washington D.C., in San Francisco and in Boston, the buildings we would like to own, billions of dollars\u2019 worth of assets. Whether these things actually are for sale is another question. And we're not going to obviously identify what those buildings are.\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nBut let me just add to the fact. This is for a company like Boston Properties. We really do have a comparative advantage, even the competitive advantage in terms of our ability and our credibility to buy major buildings in these markets. And you never know. We're in the flow. We're in dialogue with all kinds of different people, and you never can predict when it happens. And until you sign anything, you just don't really know whether a deal is going to close. But we're certainly in that flow and we have both the financial wherewithal and the management wherewithal and the credibility to be competitive, shall we say, and anything that comes on the market.\nJames C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nOkay. And then finally for Mike. Do you have an update on CapEx spend for the year? Or maybe AFFO guidance based on the revised guidance?\nMichael E. LaBelle\nSure. The CapEx spend for the year obviously, it was a little bit higher this quarter on the leasing transaction costs. We gave our guidance for our occupancy, which is basically 91% to 93%. So if you look at the amount of square footage, that leads to it somewhere between 1.5 million and 2.5 million square feet for the year. So, based upon what we think our average leasing costs are, that's somewhere between $100 million and $140 million of transaction cost. On the CapEx side, we'd break out our recurring CapEx and our nonrecurring CapEx. So we have a recurring CapEx that we believe will be $30 million or $35 million. That\u2019s CapEx on our normal portfolio. And we do have additional CapEx that we don't include in our FAD, which is acquisition CapEx. And that relates to Bay Colony primarily, where we have we told you we're going to spend somewhere in the range of $22 million, $25 million on that asset. And you saw in the first quarter, we have about $6 million of what we call nonrecurring CapEx, and most of that was for Bay Colony. There's also some money that we'll spend about $7 million for the Hancock Tower for the next 12 to 18 months, I would say. But for our FAD purposes, the way we look at it is about $30 million to $35 million. And then if you look at the straight-line rents that I talked about, the noncash interest expense where our annual noncash interest expense will be about $30 million. And then our noncash compensation and ground lease, you come up with somewhere in the $570 million to $590 million range for FAD for the year for our projection, which is 335 to 345 a square foot or share [ph] somewhere in that area.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa.\nSteve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division\nMort, I guess the first question, as you've kind of look to November and the elections, I'm just wondering if you kind of think about the 2 possible outcomes for the White House and as you think about kind of the Senate races, I guess, how do you think the difference outcomes affect business leaders' psychology, which clearly seems to be holding things back? And do you have sort of a strong handicap, not so much who will win, but just on sort of the perceived outcomes that the 2 different candidates might give to the country and how that might affect the sort of the business conditions and office demand in '13 and beyond?\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nWell, sure. Look, I think there is no question, but that there is a sharp division in terms of the attitude of the business community, something I've written about and something I actually have lunch in the White House on and et cetera. The business community is enormously, not totally, of course, but enormously concerned over this administration. And it's not just the big business community. We have 6 million small and medium-size businesses and they are particularly concerned and it shows up in the nature of their hiring. They are mostly hiring people on a part-time basis because they are concerned over the possibility of what those -- the benefit programs are, particularly healthcare, that really inhibits them from hiring people. They want to avoid that kind of a benefit carrier and they have really been very, very careful about hiring. As I say, roughly 50% of all hires are temporary hires or part-time hires, where the, whatchamacallit, the companies are not carrying on the benefit burden that they think is just impossible for them to carry in a relatively weak economy. So I do think that we'll see what happens to the Supreme Court decision on the healthcare bill. I think that if it does get rejected, and I suspect if I had to make a modest bet, I'd say 5 to 4 that it will be rejected. I think that will take a lot of pressure off of the business community. And if somebody gets into office who is willing to take on the issues of debts and deficits and who has a more -- a clearer understanding, shall we say, of how the business community works that is not hostile to it, of course, there'll be a change in the attitude. Whether it\u2019ll translate into large-scale to increase investments, increase business activity, we\u2019ll just have to see. But I do think there's a real issue of confidence in the Administration that exists there today, and I think is very a real concern as much on the leadership. And you see, frankly, as I again, I have to point this out, politically, you should make an enormous difference to the business community. You see it in New York City with the mayor of New York. You see it in Boston with the mayor Boston. These are 2 really very strong, very effective leaders and they've made a big difference in terms of the willingness of the companies to continue to grow in these markets, to invest in these markets. And I think the same thing would apply nationally; not only to big businesses but to smaller businesses. So I think that is definitely an issue in the campaign. Whether it determines the campaign is another thing. We obviously have, I think, a very weak economy with a real unemployment number that is not at 8.2%, but if you measure it according to what the government calls U6, which measures people who have been out of a job or apply for job in the last 6 months, not just in the last 4 weeks, since a huge portion of our -- the average portion of the people who are out of work, the term that they are out of work is over 6 months. So just assume they're going to be applying for a job every 4 weeks is simply unrealistic. You fix the unemployment rating shade under 15%, and if you add to that, the number of people who've left the labor force, if you assume that we had the same kind of labor force participation rate, that we had when the stimulus program in this Administration would passed, you would have an unemployment rate of both at U6 another 2.8% on top of it, roughly 15%. So we have a very weak economy that we're all struggling with. It has been sustained by largest of a monetary and fiscal stimulus program we've ever had in the history of this country including the 1930s, and yet it's had a fairly minor effect. If you look at what the real growth in the first quarter of this year was, it's well under 2% because it says 2.2%, but 0.6% of that was inventory and there were a number of other parts of it that really weakened those numbers. I don't know where it's going right now. We are not in a -- I mean, I am not anyhow, in a larger sense, bullish about the economy. I don't think we're going to have a double dip, but we may as we're in an unprecedented kind of economic situation, which is, therefore, unpredictable. But I -- as I look at these numbers and I've look at them over and over and over again, I have to say they are really very, very weak. The unemployment numbers or employment numbers are very weak. The income numbers are very weak. The retail sales numbers are very weak when you boil it down to -- take out food, fuel. The overall GDP growth is weak, and this, in the context of some very, very, very stimulative programs on the monetary and fiscal side. So I don't know where it goes. I'd love to -- I've always been saying that the difference today between an optimist and a pessimist when it comes to the economy is that an optimist thinks that this is the best of all possible worlds, and a pessimist fears he may be right. I'm in the pessimist side on the -- of the overall economy. And frankly in that context, I'm very, very, I have to say, pleased or I feel that I'm very sanguine about how Boston Properties has been doing and that is basic strategy as I keep on reiterating over and over again. Having the best buildings in the best locations really works in these kinds of markets because our companies are willing to go into those buildings and look to go into those buildings. The rents are down but the occupancy remains relatively very high. So I think we're very comfortable with where we are. And we think, since we'd take a long term to do things, to go back to another question, we're going to continue to look for assets that we can acquire or developments that we think will make sense over the longer term. That's still our basic strategy. It worked out very well, and it's really been tested in this kind of very weak economy that we've had. And so we think that there's still going to be a lot of good opportunities for us.\nSteve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division\nDoug, just maybe a question for you and maybe for some of the regional folks, but we've continued to see sort of a downward pressure on space proportion [ph] in the U.S. And I'm just wondering, how much further the downsizing can go? And just how you sort of think about that? And in terms of, if we do get a rebound in jobs, do we not necessarily get a rebound into that absorption figures across the major markets?\nDouglas T. Linde\nI'd answer the question as follows, Steve. I think that there is absolutely no question that the way people work today is very different than the way they worked 10 years ago. So as long-term leases roll over, the companies that are the beneficiaries of the older spaces are going to find great efficiencies in the new configurations and the uses of space. That being said, we do not believe that you can get to 0 and that everyone is going to be virtual businesses. In fact, we think that one of the things that's going on is that the amount of space that is needed for companies to come together and bring their employees together so that they can work in groups, they can share ideas, they can feel connected to whatever they're doing is enhancing. And so the -- what we refer to as collaboration space or \u201cwe space\u201d or whatever you want to call it, it increases and is getting larger in a lot of the sort of new age companies including financial services firms by that -- in that same vein. And that there will continue to be a need for the kind of space and the kind of buildings that we offer and operate. But that's the traditional, the easiest one to use is the law firm. The traditional law firm space is going to a different way of doing business. There are fewer conference rooms. There are a fewer secretarial support stations. There are fewer word processing pools. There are fewer areas where people are storing space, which compresses the amount the amount of space. And by the way, in some cases, the amount of lawyers that are sitting in their offices make it larger because a lot of that lawyers maybe spending time out of the office so that they don't have to be sitting on top of each other all the time. I mean absolutely, no question, we've been seeing it for 3 or 4 years in a very big way in all of our markets and it continues on a consistent basis. So we think it's here to stay.\nRaymond A. Ritchey\nDoug, this is Ray Ritchey. I'd just like to add too that from our perspective, Boston Properties' perspective, our locations are being sought out by these tenants who were saying, \u201cHey, listen, I'm taking less space, but I want to put my employees in a location where I can recruit, retain and motivate the best and brightest.\u201d That means locations like San Francisco, Reston Town Center, obviously Cambridge, the best buildings in New York. So I think while there's a decline in space, there's a real move towards locations and buildings just like the ones we own in our core markets.\nRobert E. Selsam\nIt's Robert Selsam. I want to add one note about law firms as I see them in New York. I've seen no movement away from private windows offices for attorneys, and we've seen them get a little smaller over time. And at 250 West 55th Street, we shrank the window mullion from 5 foot to 4 foot 9. So we took 6 inches off the typical 10-foot office. But that fundamental premise has not changed at all. That is a private office for attorney. And so it's only so far you can go with reducing workstations and libraries and all other facilities.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Chris Caton.\nChris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nI wanted to follow-up on dispositions. Could you talk a little bit about the selling process for the Bedford Research Park? And if you're actively identifying any other assets in the portfolio that you might look to sell over the next year or 2?\nMichael E. LaBelle\nSo the way the Bedford sale process worked is that we hired a third-party broker and we went to the market and we did an aggressive campaign and we got 5 bids. And we had a process that narrowed it down and we had a high bidder. And the high bidder re-traded us and we moved from the high bidder and we went to the second bidder and the second bidder closed. And we have identified other assets of a similar location and quality that over time, we think makes sense to prune from the portfolio. And based upon pricing and opportunities to do 1031, et cetera, we'll continue to have -- do selective stuff.\nChris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nI guess, because I was also asking based on your experience in a disposition process where you're modestly pleased by the interest you attracted in that change, how you look at any of the other assets in your portfolio that you might prune over time?\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nWe were -- what we -- what the -- what we expected and what we're -- where we were sort of indicated initially before we started the process was within 2% of where we closed the transaction. So we were not surprised nor disappointed.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb.\nAlexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division\nGoing to 510 Madison for quickly, can you just describe what the activity is like? You mentioned, I think, about 6 leases that had been done. Are you mostly seeing just sort of traditional hedge funds? Or are there other sort of small boutique users who value that -- those guys\u2019 floor plates and quality of finish?\nDouglas T. Linde\nI'll let Robert answer that question.\nRobert E. Selsam\nIt's mostly small financial firms. There are a couple of smaller international companies as well, but it's primarily what you would traditionally call hedge fund types.\nAlexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division\nSo you're not seeing like P&E law firms or anything like that? Other sorts of similar type users who would be willing to pay those rents? It's really just the hedge funds?\nRobert E. Selsam\nThat's correct.\nAlexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division\nOkay. And this is a question for Ray down in D.C. I just want to understand what the fallout from GSA scandal has been? Has that affected leasing down there? Or because of what's going on with government spending overall, the GSA scandal really hasn't affected the market much?\nRaymond A. Ritchey\nWell, yes. It's kind of like the perfect storm. There was some hesitance [ph] to move forward in the next 5 or 6 months just because of rushing. And now with the senior management shakeup, the higher levels, the big prospective level of procurements of space are really on hold. The day-to-day was struggling anyways. I don't think the day-to-day, the under 200,000 or 300,000 square-foot deals and renewals will be too profoundly impacted by the change at the top. But obviously, the big deals are and the day-to-day deals are just struggling under the weight of the process of GSA. So it's not a good situation at all for those who are really focusing on GSA. have 2 big renewals coming up -- I'm sorry, renewal and a competitive process. We're optimistic that both will get done because both are -- one\u2019s an existing renewal that should -- they either have to stay or go, and they're going to stay, hopefully. And one is the mission-critical deal that we feel very confident about.\nAlexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division\nOkay. And just a final question, on the Dewey & LeBoeuf, the law firm obviously is the latest law firm to have some issues. Are you guys noticing an increase in your credit watch of law firms? Or Dewey and Hawley [ph] last year, these are of sort isolated incidents?\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nLet me just answer that. The Dewey is really an isolated incident because however they came to this conclusion, they agreed to, in their desire to build a firm, they've brought in a lot of partners with guaranteed incomes of $2 million to $3 million, $4 million, even $5 million. And when the downturn hit, they obviously were in real problems in terms of meeting all of these obligations. And then it turns out that they had a big loan from the bank and the bank had a condition in it, which is not unusual for lenders -- for lawyers rather, that if there are more than 10% of the partners' lease, the loan becomes due. Well, they've lost over 20% of their partners. So they've just gotten themselves into a horrible situation. And it's not because those lawyers are still not doing well. It's just that they were brought in on terms that the firm overall couldn't afford unless they were in a continued bubble of activity. And so that was a one-off kind of a situation, the way I would describe it.\nDouglas T. Linde\nSo let me give you the Boston Properties perspective. So Michael LaBelle is a relatively conservative person and he has a group of people working for him that spend an awful lot of time underwriting credit risks, and given that we have a lot of exposure to law firms, we have really good comparative information on our legal tenancies. And what is quite clear is when you have a law firm that has a lot of debt, you have things that you need to worry about. And when you have a law firm that doesn't have any debt, you've got a very different business model and a very different profile of default risk. And so we think long and hard about the firms that we are doing business with and the proposals that we're prepared to make, and particularly the amount of capital we're prepared to put into a transaction. And we have on occasion with a law firm that was highly leveraged or more highly leveraged than the other firms in our portfolio, basically made proposals that were effectively bid to lose. And we've been lucky enough that when we have had a law firm that has gone under, and we have had some, because obviously Hawley [ph] was in our portfolio, and Heller Ehrman was in our portfolio, the way that they've built out the space and the locations of those buildings have been such that they were readily re-marketable to other tenants in the law firms, and so we were able to get a great recovery on those spaces. And that again, that has to do with where our buildings are and how our buildings are put together and how people are thoughtful about putting space into our buildings and the way we push ourselves into those processes, so that we don't find ourselves with antiquated, inappropriate build-outs in these types of installations where there's potentially a risk that something like this would happen.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Knott.\nMichael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division\nI just wonder if you can give a little more color on the decision on the comments regarding London. It seems like a fairly significant change from your past comments and is in contrast to some of the media reports. So just curious how you're thinking seems to have changed on that?\nDouglas T. Linde\nI'll start and I'll let Mort add on. I find the fact that media reports are dictating what people think is going on, frustrating because they seem to get way ahead of themselves. So I don't think that in itself has -- not that anything is changed. We can -- we looked at a number of assets in London. We looked at a number of opportunities. We pursued some. The economic requirements and the opportunities didn't get to the point where we were prepared to consummate a transaction. We, and as I said, right now, we're focusing our attention primarily on our core markets. Not to say we don't have our ear on Grindstone in London about what's going, and to the extent something of interest appears that is sort of on our radar screen. We'll continue to -- we would pursue it, but I'd say our focus is in our core markets. Mort? Anything that you want to add to that, Mort?\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nYes. I'm sorry. Yes, I mean, look, again that is a market at some point that if we find the right situation, we're going to be willing to look into. It has different -- we've been going there and looking over the last several years and we've had several situations that we looked at. There are different ways in which those buildings are leased in the way those buildings\u2019 leases are escalated, and to some extent, in the way those buildings are financed. And it's still a market that we think is attractive. We have a lot of other things that are, I think, in our own traditional markets that we think offer us at this point better opportunities. But I'm sure at some point it will be going back and then looking into that market again.\nMichael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. So just to summarize this. We shouldn't be surprised to see you'll eventually go there? But the odds of any kind of near-term expansion are lower than they were before?\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nYes, significantly lower. We do have some situations here that we're very happy to look into and we feel we ought to concentrate on the markets we're already in.\nMichael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Mort, does that suggest that you guys have some additional acquisition opportunities in the U.S. that you feel better about than you did previously?\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nYes. I mean, look, we're -- that is something we are looking at all the time. We have made many acquisitions over the years. We expect to make additional acquisitions as we go forward. As I said before, we are, shall we say, uniquely qualified and competitive in that world because we know the market. We know the players. We have the -- we understand the leasing. We understand the escalations. We understand the real estate. We understand the financing [ph] . And we have the equity capital necessary to be able to move quickly and decisively. So we think we have the comparative advantage in these markets, and there are situations that we hope we can develop over time, and we're going to concentrate on that at least for the moment.\nMichael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division\nOkay and then just a quick one on the city renewal. Is that the same footprint that they have now?\nDouglas T. Linde\nYes.\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nYes.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Gabriel Hilmoe.\nGabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nJust following it up on the disposition question. On the Princeton portfolio, when do you think that becomes a real possibility for a potential sale again?\nDouglas T. Linde\nI can't answer that question with a timeframe. We know we thought we had a deal. The deal didn't work out. We had a 1031. It made sense at that time. At this point, our focus at the moment is on increasing the occupancy in Princeton and looking at other -- build pursuit opportunities that are -- that seem to be at least floating around the marketplace on the land that we control and at some point in time, well, we would consider a sale again.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Josh Attie.\nMichael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division\nIt's Michael Bilerman. I just had a question, just either Mort or Doug or Bob, just talk a little bit New York and lower Manhattan? And just in terms of the dynamics that are happening in the marketplace and sort of your thoughts overall about how space potentially could get leased up downtown? And sort of your interest potentially on expanding?\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nWell, that, as anybody who knows the New York market knows it's really -- turns into an astonishingly strong market. New York City is the second most active site for the sort of new high-tech economy, second only to Silicon Valley. And now just to give you an illustration, I was involved in the establishment of this new university that is going to be started on city land, 10 acres of city land, and the head of one of the major universities that was competing came to see me. And I asked him, why would you want to move from your present campus, which is in a great location and has a worldwide reputation? He said, why wouldn\u2019t you want to move to New York? He said, New York is the only city that our faculty would be willing to move to. And I think that's one of the unique aspects of New York. It is in a position to attract a lot of the people who are in this world. It's not the only market, but I would say it's very close second to San Francisco and Silicon Valley. So I think this part of the city is going to develop in dramatic ways. We are looking for ways, consistent with what we think we can do to get involved in that market. I suspect that we're going to get involved in that market sooner rather than later. We're certainly looking and we haven't found anything yet, but we're certainly looking. And we think we are going to be in a position to appeal to that market. The model for what the city is doing with Technion University and Cornell University was, to my surprise, Kendall Square that Boston Properties developed from its inception many, many literally decades ago. So we've had a lot of experience in those kinds of companies that really are affiliated or like to affiliate with academic institutions. We did it in Cambridge. We did it to a degree that was unprecedented. We started where nobody ever even thought of those kinds of developments in what we call Technology Square in Cambridge and Kendall Square. We were really working with MIT. We're going to continue to pursue those kinds of activities because in fact, this is another major growth area, and we think we can be very effective in it. So we're definitely going to be into that piece of the market.\nMichael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division\nOkay. I -- just one comment, Mort, and you correct me if I'm wrong. That's a different characteristic than the existing inventory in and around the World Trade Center, the World Financial Center. Those are different types of buildings?\nMortimer B. Zuckerman\nYes, absolutely.\nOperator\nAt this time I would like to turn the call back over to Doug Linde for any additional remarks.\nDouglas T. Linde\nThank you all for joining us. Well I hope we've got all your questions answered. And you can always obviously feel free to call, where we think our disclosure is such that we can answer just anything at this point. And we'll see many of you at the NAREIT conference in June in New York City. Have a good rest of the week. Thanks.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's Boston Properties conference call. Thank you again for attending, and have a great day.\n\n",

(NASDAQ:ADI) BMO Technology, Media & Entertainment Conference  December 10, 2013  1:15 PM ET\nExecutives\nDave Zinsner - CFO\nAli Husain - Director of IR\nAnalysts\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\n\n\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nWelcome everybody and welcome back after lunch. And thanks, welcome here to the ADI folks. We have Dave Zinsner, CFO; Ali Husain, IR. So before we go into the -- this is supposed to be a fireside Q&A and we\u2019ll then open it up to questions for the audience. But before we do that Dave, if you could just walk us, give us a quick overview of the ADI story for those who may not be familiar with the company.\nDave Zinsner\nSo I\u2019m actually -- I\u2019ll let Ali do the elevated pitch, and then we\u2019ll kind of tag team on the questions. So, Ali why don\u2019t you?\nAli Husain\nAll right. Hi everyone. Thanks Ambrish for having us at BMO as well. So I see a lot of faces here, some new, some that I know. But in any event thank you for being here. So, the analog piece of the semiconductor market is about $30 billion and ADI is about 10% of that market. And really when you kind of split that market out, you have two pieces; one being power management whereas that area where most of our competitors play, the other piece being the signal path or where ADI plays. And really the fundamental building blocks of the signal paths are converters and what we call the high performance amplifiers. And both these sort of product areas, are areas where ADI derives over two thirds of our revenue and where we are also the market leader and are gaining share.\nSo it\u2019s a little bit of a unique story with ADI within analog, so not only we\u2019re not doing -- we\u2019re doing a bit of power management, we're really we\u2019re focusing much more or serve on the signal path. But where we are focusing is in areas where basically we have the number one market share position and where we\u2019re gaining share. At ADI most of our products are very sort of long life cycled products. There is very low capital intensity. None of our customers -- but you know we don\u2019t have a single customer that\u2019s greater than 5% of sales. It\u2019s a very sort of diversified kind of customer base, not only on the customer side but across regions and markets as well. \nWhat this all allows us to do is basically generate a lot of cash and what we try to then do is take that cash and return it to our shareholders. So, just a couple of quarter ago we put into place this plan of returning 80% of our generated free cash flow to our shareholders over the next five years. And we\u2019re early stages yet of that plan, but certainly it\u2019s a commitment over the five years, over the next five years we\u2019ll be returning 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders.\nAnd just quickly just level set in terms of how our end market split works out, but half of our sales come from the industrial end market, but 20% or so comes from the automotive end market and that\u2019s been growing very well for us. Another about 20% comes from the communications infrastructure end market, primarily in the wireless side where the radios basically that go on base stations. And then about another 14% or 15% depending on the quarter comes from the consumer end market.\nSo that\u2019s kind of ADI in an about a 30 second elevated pitch I think, and I\u2019ll just turn it back over to you Ambrish for questions.\nQuestion-And-Answer Session\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nOkay, thank you very much. So, you guys have been very transparent about consumer, we had been through this. At the last earnings call there were a lot -- not a lot, there were few questions around market share loss in industrial communications. And I was trying to -- Ali I went back and tried to do it and it's so hard to do because you can\u2019t do an apples-to-apples comparison. People count their industrial businesses differently, they count their communication differently. But at a high level if you just look at industrial -- if we look at total analog versus ADI, and we understand there you have, as I said before you\u2019ve talked about the consumer. But what is the right way to think about market share in the hard to count market such as industrial and communications?\nDave Zinsner\nWell, let me take a little like kind of side position on this. If you look at kind of the -- Ali talked about the kind of major building blocks of products we sell. Two thirds of our revenue comes either from data converters or high performance amps. In both of those, you can look at IDE supply and data bins and data quests, whatever as you want to. In both cases our share has actually increased over the last four or five years. So, I think we\u2019re pretty confident, we haven\u2019t lost share. In fact actually we\u2019ve been gaining share.\nThere has been -- it does look like power management might have grown a little bit faster if you look at it over kind of an extended period of time. So that might present some anomalies or relative outperformance. But, I think most of it is actually a combination of -- there is a lot of different pieces defined as an industrial in different companies. And so I think in a lot of cases we for example throw in defense but we don\u2019t throw in automotive, which is one of the fastest growing sub-markets and some people throw in automotive, of course that would make our industrial business grow pretty fast.\nWe have revenue recognition differences. We recognize revenue only when it shifts through to the end customer with regard to distributors. And in most cases companies they use a hybrid or they recognize all their revenue shift into distribution, so that kind of talk with some anomalies data.\nI think looking at a quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s almost impossible to really reconcile and we can't even reconcile, even when I'm looking at it to try to make sure everything makes sense from what I see, I can\u2019t even be sure of what I\u2019m looking at because of so much difference in the data. I think you got to look at it over kind of a longer period of time. And I think it\u2019s just still happens, this happens to be a -- as you kind of -- as you look at us in this quarter this happens to be a weaker quarter. We have Thanksgiving period, we have Christmas, we\u2019re going to Lunar New Year in our quarter which unusual for our first quarter. So that\u2019s just a lot of like seasonal weakness that makes this quarter kind of have a bad compare.\nBut, if history is any guide and given the fact that Lunar New Year is really in the first quarter this time around, you totally expect a pretty descent second quarter. And so I guess the way I\u2019m going to say it is, come back to me at the end of 2014 and let\u2019s see where everything kind of shakes out. I think you\u2019ll find that we -- as a percentage of total analog, we\u2019ll have at least maintained our level, if not grown our percentage of that pie over that period.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nSo there was a lot of angst among my fellow sell-siders on the guidance. And I\u2019ve said on the call that we were surprised -- you're guidance is actually in line with the seasonal patterns. So where was the disconnect, was there a consumer ramp that for some reason people misconstrued what\u2019s going to happen?\nDavid Zinsner\nWell, I think part of it was they didn\u2019t understand the Lunar New Year aspect of things. I mean we lose anywhere from 2 to 4 percentage points off of our quarter when we have Lunar New Year within that quarter. So again you strip, let\u2019s take the midpoint of that say three points. The midpoint of our guidance was 7.5, that kind of takes it to 4.5. You take another point, Microphone was obviously not in anybody\u2019s -- the idea we\u2019d sell it was not faked into anybody\u2019s numbers and that\u2019s going to be a point of headwind that we\u2019ll have going into the quarter.\nSo I think you put that in as well. And you\u2019re basically at kind of the consensus of most of the other peers down say 3.5%. So I think it\u2019s partly just you had to know the dynamics of that seasonal softness of Lunar New Year combined with the fact that we lost the Microphone because we sold it for $100 million. And I think that was most of the disconnect. I do think that there has been this, from our perspective, from investors\u2019 perspective, from the research analysts\u2019 perspective, this believes that eventually this thing has got to turn. I can\u2019t be soft forever, right?\nAnd so what\u2019s happening I think with the models is they have this one quarter, two quarters out, this is like inflection because they figure oh my god it\u2019s been too long it has to happen. It\u2019s going to happen. I mean I know it\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s just the question of really when. And it's just timing of everything and the analysts expected it at a time in which that wasn\u2019t likely to happen given the seasonal softness that we see. But we\u2019ll see what happens for the rest of 2014.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nI think we\u2019re all wrong on trying to predict when things return. So let\u2019s just forget the near term now, just transition on to the more longer term and I think on the earnings call you guys were pretty on a cubicle come down and saying we see a trajectory back to 6% to 8% kind of growth. And my question is, does that mean that the headwinds from any consumer divestiture that you\u2019re looking, that\u2019s behind us, and we\u2019re stabilizing the consumer side? And that\u2019s why you are confident and kind of not -- I\u2019m not trying to pin use 2014, but just longer term what\u2019s the right way to think about ADI\u2019s business?\nDavid Zinsner\nI think what we believe is that over the last call it three -- at least three years, maybe as much as five years, we\u2019ve made a kind of a conscious shift of investment away from some of the consumer oriented market and into areas like industrial comp infrastructure, automotive, which has already seen some growth. When you make a shift away from consumer, three days later you feel the impact. I mean it\u2019s really fast the way businesses, I'm exaggerating slightly, but it\u2019s really quickly the fast the way the investments kind of move away or the attention rather from your customers moves away from you. So you feel, you experience that very quickly and that\u2019s why happened in the consumer business. We had kind of a pretty meaningful compression of that business over the last five years.\nConversely, when you make investments into industrial and com infrastructure and you double down in those areas, it takes a long time for those things to manifest itself into revenue. And sometimes it can be seven years before you actually see revenue of the design let alone to development effort. So I think that\u2019s kind of what we experience is the slight pocket of revenue kind of going away in consumer and the results of the investments near the market just has not picked up yet.\nWe do believe that 2014 looks like a pretty descent year for a pick up. Although having said that I think the out year is beyond that '15, '16, '17 have even a better opportunity for traction, particularly in areas like the industrial area. Automotive will probably already experienced some and of course com will do what it does. So, I think that gives us some confidence. We have a lot of analytics and we\u2019re no short of analytics at ADI, so we have a good sense I think of our design pipeline, how that\u2019s likely to manifest itself into revenue and a good sense of where we're headed in terms of business.\nNow, of course all of this predicated on reasonable microenvironment and quite honestly we would have been helped out that a lot if things weren\u2019t choppy on the macro side over the last few years. Hopefully, things are stabilizing now, the uncertainty in the world is starting to go away. When uncertainty goes away, yields of the world start to put some money into investment, they upgrade factories, they try to get the next level of technology and that\u2019s really what we need for that to happen in order for our business to have some meaningful growth. We certainly have --- I could tell you that we\u2019re heavily incentivized to hit that 8% number. My variable compensation was a high amount, my compensation is based on getting that 8% number. So I think the company is firmly engaged on the efforts that are required to make that happen.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nSo just zooming back onto the overall analog industry and it\u2019s not you, everybody has suffered that as you started out by saying, we've all been thinking that there will be eventual get back to some kind of normalized growth. One would think that if you look at the industry guys like you Maxim, Linear, TI have strong balance sheets, franchised business. And then it almost seems like there hasn\u2019t had not, it seems to be a diverse big dichotomy in the guys who don\u2019t have it, they\u2019re falling behind. There was a time a few years ago we used to think about, oh my good look at all the Asian analog companies they\u2019re going to take share, right? It happened in pockets, so we need to think what are the challenges that you would think that, bigger stronger companies should have a longer and a more stronger pipeline?\nDave Zinsner\nWell, I think the biggest key -- I went with Vince around, we visited customers in Europe and we did a few in North America as well. And what is clear to me, I thought it was a little bit of lip service actually when the guys originally would talk about this, but having heard it directly from the customers, I have a real appreciation for it and that is the customers more and more are scaling down their hardware design efforts and pushing more of their dollars into software. And as they do that, they now rely on the semiconductor providers to do more of the hardware design. Before they could take data convertor and the amp out of the catalog and coupled those together and add some power management and so forth and boom they had their board. They just don\u2019t have the people to do that anymore. They got to work on the software problems that they face. \nSo, now more and more they\u2019re pushing that effort off to players like Analog Devices, and you got to have a pretty good level of portfolio, pretty significant amount of portfolio enable to do those, to be able to do those system level designs. You need to know the data conversion. You need to know the amplifier and you need to have sensor products. And that the companies that at a certain levels don\u2019t have that scale, I think are faced with a pretty difficult challenge which didn\u2019t exist before. You could kind of come up with a product and get it into the end market and have pretty good traction at least on end market, that just isn\u2019t the way the world is moving.\nSo, I think that\u2019s our advantage. One thing which Ali mentioned at the beginning was, we start with signal processing that\u2019s really are the core DNA of ADI. I think most of the companies that you mentioned really have a bias towards power management. So for us if there is an advantage in that, most of the problems that initially have to be solved, have to be solved around, okay we need to capture something and we need to condition it and convert it and send it off to a processor -- that\u2019s not in the DNA of a power company. And so it gives us kind of a very early read into kind of the system design of these businesses. And so we can augment a lot of our core positions and data with some of our other products and kind of build that into the system as well and sell those. And I think that's really our opportunity.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nIf you look at your core businesses where you are investing industrial and auto, I think a few years ago you highlighted automotive and shown the growth in that segment and you are bringing up industrial now and its so many different little segments going to it. But what are some of the higher, bigger applications or end markets that are driving this confidence?\nDave Zinsner\nSo one the businesses in this end market is the healthcare business. And it's actually been a business that hasn't grown significantly. We separately manage it as a company internally much like we did with automotive, but we saw a kind of the early reads about how automotive was going. I think it was 8% of sales when I initially broke it out, and now it's 20%. So it\u2019s ramped significantly since then. Healthcare we weren't quite there yet. We didn't quite think we had something that really justified that kind of breakout. But I think I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of it. We have won some significant designs. We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars of design in the healthcare space. The trick with healthcare is the cycle to revenue takes a while, not only because the applications take a while to get to market but then it goes -- usually it has to go through some approval process in the various countries it\u2019s going to be sold into and that takes a whole series of reviews and so forth.\nAnd so when it will happen, it's difficult to say but I think we have a pretty good line of sight and we\u2019re seeing some fairly meaningful ramp in that healthcare business. Some of the other ones that probably are a little bit farther along, a little bit mature, we sell a lot of products into energy management, both at the power meter and in the smart grid itself. Energy efficiency, always they\u2019ve been a huge macro trend out there and we are certainly benefiting from that. We also make signal processing that helps kind of manage mortar control and make them more power efficient. So that's obviously gotten a lot of traction as well in that space. What am I missing, Ali?\nJust overall I would say this move in factory, it's towards kind of more automated factory systems. We sell a lot of silicon into robotics. And so I think that that's a good opportunity, but quite honestly it is a lot of little wins. There is not a ton of real home runs in the industrial space, it's a ton of singles and doubles and it\u2019s the aggregation of all of those that really kind of drives the growth. I would tell you that as we shifted, I think I want to say somewhere in the neighborhood of 20%, 25% of R&D used to be invested in the consumer space. We have scaled that down quite a bit.\nA lot of the R&D resources went over into the industrial space to just continue to refine, build out, even more systems oriented products to go into the industrial space, that hopefully get great traction across hundreds and thousands of customers and kind of the incremental steps of doing that that really drives the growth.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nSo sounds like if I was a samurai that -- if I go back a few years you laid out auto and you start breaking it out and then we saw the result of that, it was like medical seems to be an area that...\nDave Zinsner\nI think that's probably a good opportunity, but I think the opportunity in the overall industrial space is quite good for us.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nJust in terms of the other segment that you guys also had a webcast on mems, what\u2019s the right way to think competition wise, as to micro and then related to that, what is it due to the margin profile if management [ph] starts to grow.\nDave Zinsner\nSo mems for us, up until the last quarter was a combination of motion sensing products and microphone products. The microphone business looked like it was getting to a point where it didn't really make a lot of sense for ADI to own that business. So we sold it to InvenSense and I think they will do a better job at driving it into the consumer space and that\u2019s really where they want to play. So it works out well for them.\nSo now we\u2019re just concentrated in the motion side. We also focus that business away from consumers, with generally in automotive and investor applications, increasingly more industrial applications are using mems products to get sense of relative motion. We\u2019re putting, we\u2019re actually launching [ph] drilling equipment, even going into the energy systems, identify tremors, so that it can be helpful in certain cases. So, it\u2019s got a wide range of uses.\nAs you point out the margins in that business today are below the corporate average, mostly as a result of just a couple of products that get sold into the automotive space and what\u2019s hampered the gross margins of automotive mems has been more to do with the cost of manufacturing than it has to do with kind of pricing and AFPs. In fact it gets great revenue per wafer, [indiscernible] way for kind of manufacturing [indiscernible], the revenue per wafer, because it is really, really good. It\u2019s just a matter of getting the cost right. And as you bring out kind of newer technology, sometimes you got to get the [indiscernible] out of it and in this case, because of the quality standards in the automotive space and we were just trying to get products out that basically meet the function, that marriage wasn\u2019t quite there and the cost is quite a bit higher than it should be.\nWe redesigned those products. We have new products down in the marketplace. It will take some time for those new products to cannibalize the old. But when that happens, the margins are going to be great in mems. And so, if it grows, fantastic, good for us, good for margins, good for profits.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nSo, there is nothing structurally that keeps the margins lower?\nDave Zinsner\nNo. \nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nSwitching over from profits to shareholder return. You guys are right at the top in terms of your reputation and correctly so in terms watching out for the shareholder capital. If you look at what you guys are committed to, 80%, this year you started out low on the buyback and I think you accelerated that. What\u2019s the right way to think about the mix between, A, what\u2019s the right way to think about mix between buyback and dividend, and then secondly I get this question a lot, Ali, when you and I were on the MBR trade after that I was getting -- what are the metrics that ADI uses buyback stock?\nDave Zinsner\nYes, okay. So, I would say in general, you could expect that probably at least two thirds of -- maybe it\u2019s closer even to three quarters of the cash flow return comes in the form of a dividend. We pay a good strong dividend. We\u2019re generally are paying out in the 60s as a percent of free cash flow for the dividend. So, that\u2019s going to be our primary mechanism to get cash back to shareholders and it\u2019s a commitment and I think we found that when you pay out in that kind of level, payout ratio basis, it\u2019s generally rewarded in your stock.\nAnd then the additional, to get to the 80% is obviously the buyback and as you point out, probably under tuned it I guess the buyback, we built a buyback structure that take advantage of volatility in the stock and when the stock kind of dips in kind of periods of, it\u2019s buyback stock and then when it goes above kind of these moving average as it doesn\u2019t, it just so happens that kind of the volatility that we saw in the past was a little bit smoother than we have historically -- smoother over the last year or so than it has historically been and that\u2019s the algorithm we kind of set up to do the buyback. We just never really executed significantly.\nSo what I did was I tuned it up a little bit more, so that it took less volatility for the buybacks to trigger and I did that at the beginning of October and it worked out perfectly, because we bought back $46 million worth of stock in that month but I think I pointed out that that was one month of buyback. So, now it\u2019s going to be tuned to that level going forward and so I would expect that month to be at decent representation of stock buybacks we should see, unless of course the stock really runs up, we shall be perfectly happy seeing, and then of course we wouldn\u2019t, but and then we\u2019ll figure out a different way to do it.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nI don\u2019t think shareholders [indiscernible]. \nDave Zinsner\nBut we are committed to the 80% and I recognize that we\u2019ve been under that 80% for a few quarters and that it banked, it\u2019s not like that hasn\u2019t been banked. So, I would expect that there will quarters, I don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll come, but there will be quarters that we will payback more than 80%, so that the average stays at the 80% level.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nOne more from me and then I\u2019ll open it up to the audience. On the operating model, you guys have a good job on the margin front, versus where you were in the last, and if you look at same utilization, your margins are higher. As consumer becomes smaller what's the right way to think about what should be the potential for margins gross operating.\nDave Zinsner\nYes. So it\u2019s a little bit tied more to utilization I think, which obviously does tie to revenue to some extent, but I mean we\u2019re running right now, this quarter we will run in the low 60s as a percent of utilization, and we'll do roughly 64.5 plus or minus 50 basis points on a gross margin side. And this is what I would consider a kind of a trough kind of thing. We've got our inventory now in perfect condition, it's at an hundred and -- I think there's 111 days last quarter. So it was kind of within our model.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nPlease remind us where the trough was before.\nDave Zinsner\nGross margin, so the last, depends on what you call a trough, but last year first quarter, I think we were 62.8 or something like that.\nAli Husain\nYes, 62.3.\nDave Zinsner\nSo the trough is moving up. I would expect as business improves. we will be loading that fab higher. For every 10 percentage point move increase in utilization, we get about a 100 basis point improvement in gross margins, just from utilization on the front end, and we even get some benefit on the back end because we had to cap a test facility so that would also improve gross margin. So there's a pretty decent tail wind of gross margins that are up drafted, that will current gross margins as business kind of improves.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nLet's see if there are any questions in the audience.\nUnidentified analyst\nWhat\u2019s your view in terms of the right level of cash that you want to hold? I believe you hold about 30% of your market cap in cash, and I know you have a good dividend program but do you feel that you need that much cash and a related question is how do you feel about the fragmentation within the industry? Do you think you'd be stronger if there was more consolidation among the larger players?\nDave Zinsner\nSo we have roughly $3.8 billion net in cash. We obviously don't need $3.8 billion in cash. I think over time that will get deployed. Probably a lot of it will get deployed in some form of return to shareholders. It's a hung up a little bit right now, because there is some expectation that eventually Washington will realize the logic of cash repatriation and allow that cash to come back at a reasonable rate, and we\u2019re kind of waiting for that to happen. If it doesn't happen which is possibly what might transpire, then we'll figure out another way of tapping into that cash to being the cash level down.\nAs far as -- some cash obviously will be used for M&A. I would say we\u2019re not a big acquisitor of companies, and I don\u2019t expect that to change. So we'll some cash to do M&A but I don\u2019t think it's, certainly not $3.8 billion. As far as consolidation goes, I think -- the thing about Analog is, it's not an industry where you get a lot of benefits from scale and so I think that's what always kind of held up that business from having that much consolidation because it's hard to realize the benefits and a premium which is what\u2019s required, reasonable premium, which is what\u2019s required to get the company to give up their independent strategies and align themselves with bigger companies. We have seen some consolidation clearly and TI signed quite a bit of consolidation on their own, but I think it's biased towards different approaches than it is about, kind of rolling up the market.\nFor Analog, what we\u2019ll do when we do acquisitions, we generally look for technologies and we look for technologies that we're going to need within our chosen end markets that are going to be acquired down the road or within the near term that we just can\u2019t figure out a way or we don\u2019t think there is a great ROI to kind of do that internally, and that's going to be the reason we do M&A. That might create some consolidation because there might some companies out there that might fit within that model but it\u2019s for a different purpose than lots of wafers going through fabs, because it\u2019s just, the fabs only account that much anyway. I mean we talk about this updraft we get, this benefit we get in terms of absorption but really it\u2019s not that big. It isn\u2019t like oh my god, this is going to really change the world. So having 10,000 more wafers running through your fab just doesn't really move the needle enough to make a decision based on that.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets\nAny other questions? Great, thank you very much.\nDave Zinsner\nAll right, thank you.\n\n",

Gill\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'm going to highlight CME Group's third quarter, and then turn it over to Jamie to review our financials. Our focus this morning is about what's new and relevant during the quarter.\nWe've made some good traction since our last earnings call in terms of the core business and expanding our OTC clearing activity. Within our core futures complex, third quarter average daily volume was up 11% compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by continued strong growth in interest rate and mad metals.\nWe drove strong growth in electronic trading volumes outside the U.S. in our entire business.\nFor the third quarter, Latin America volumes are up 23%; Asia volumes are up 22%; and in Europe, activity rose 15% compared to the third quarter 2012.\nWe have been investing considerable time and effort in these areas, and I'm glad to see it driving volume and revenue growth.\nIn addition, we are making a concerted effort to drive growth in our options business globally. This business increased by 31% in third quarter 2013 versus last year.\nBoth interest rate and equity options were up 54%, and FX options rose 32%. In September, our treasury options reached an all-time high of 57% electronically traded on CME Globex.\nOverall, in October, approximately 48% of our total options volume traded electronically compared to 35% in all of 2012.\nAdditionally, options trading from European clients jumped by more than 100% in Q3 to more than 100,000 contracts per day.\nAsia and Latin America were each up over 70%. Lastly, within the natural gas options, our market share jumped above 70% in September compared to a range of 50% to 60% for much of the year.\nAs I mentioned, one of the main drivers of the top line growth this quarter was interest rates. Average daily volume was 5.8 million contracts per day in Q3, up 27 -- up, I'm sorry, 29% versus Q3 2012, and open interest to-date through October was -- is up more than 60% since the beginning of the year.\nAll 4 of the major components of our rates business, Eurodollar futures and options, and treasury futures and options, were up more than 20% in Q3.\nEurodollar options volume had particular strength, up 56%, with volume rebounding in the front month of the curve during September, which we haven't seen in a long time. That is illustrated on Slide 10 in our earnings deck.\nTurning to interest rate OTC clearing. We continue to see a dramatic increase in our credit swaps business. Our market share in the dealer-to-client business has grown from 5% in Q1 to 14% in Q2, 31% in Q3 and 33% so far in Q4.\nWe averaged $81 billion per day in the third quarter, doubling the activity from the second quarter 2013.\nSo far, the fourth quarter is up 26% sequentially to $102 billion.\nNow that the 3 waves from the Dodd-Frank clearing mandate are behind us, the market is shifting from a compliance phase to an optimization phase. This is a common scene we hear from market participants in our meetings.\nWith increasing client demand for greater capital efficiencies, we now have 6 clearing members live with portfolio margining of cleared OTC interest rate swaps and interest rate futures, including a few who started offering their solutions to customers within the last month.\nIn addition, product expansion has also played a key role in market share gains. During the third quarter 2013, we launched the Singapore dollar, which is our 17th interest rate swap currency and puts us in line with our competitor. Open interest within OTC is something we and market participants are monitoring closely as we move closer to 50% market share.\nInterest rate swap open interest is currently north of $7.4 trillion and has increased by more than $3.2 trillion since our last earnings call.\nDuring this time, our main competitor has added about $500 billion.\nClearly, we have done extremely well attracting Phase 2 clients, made up primarily of asset managers, insurance companies and GSEs, and we are pulling in more high turnover customers as well.\nThe bottom line is winning the dealer-to-customer OTC business strengthens our overall franchise and opens up avenues for core revenue growth.\nAlthough it is very difficult to quantify and is still in early stages, we are seeing evidence that our interest rate complex is benefiting from a migration of activity from OTC into futures.\nSince May, we have seen more than 20% growth in our interest rate complex each month when compared to the same month of the prior year.\nThis year, we have seen a significant shift in the use of treasury futures versus cash treasuries as evidenced by cash market penetration, which you can see on Slide 13.\nOur interest rate nonmetals percentage, which tends to be driven by the so-called real money clients, rose nicely from Q2 to Q3, which helped the rate per contract.\nIn addition, if you look at the CFTC commitment of traders who bought on our website, it shows a noticeable increase in asset management participation within Eurodollars increasing from 11% of the open interest to more than 15%.\nLastly, our Deliverable Swap Futures activity continues to grow. We had the strongest roll month in September. And building on that, in October, we had the strongest non-roll month to-date.\nDuring the turbulence of October, we performed relatively well despite market uncertainty related to the debt ceiling and the government shutdown.\nDuring several weeks, economic data was not readily available, and in some cases, the market adopted a wait-and-see approach as the situation developed.\nNonetheless, we did what we do best, which is to continue to provide an avenue for our clients to manage risk and express their views.\nIn October, our total average daily volume was up 12%, with rates up, as well as equities, which benefited from heightened volatility during an interesting month.\nI'm very excited about the growth trajectory of the company, and our entire employee base had done a tremendous job focusing on execution in the midst of a challenging macro backdrop with low interest rate environment.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jamie to discuss the financials.\nJames E. Parisi\nThank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was a solid quarter in many respects. Average daily volume was up 11% compared to the third quarter last year, outperforming our major peers.\nAdjusted EPS came in at $0.75, excluding FX-related benefits and several tax impacts.\nWe have seen a drop in our overall tax rate this quarter, and the benefit will be ongoing, which I'll touch on later.\nNow let's get into some of the details, starting with revenue. The rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.762, up from $0.748 last quarter. The main driver was strong nonmember participation during Q3 relative to Q2, particularly in interest rates and energy.\nOTC swaps revenue for the quarter was up almost $5 million sequentially to $11.5 million, driven by a 100% jump in interest rate swap clearing activity.\nIn addition to our success in attracting real money clients, we have also been successful in executing our strategy to attract high turnover clients, primarily large hedge funds, which on a sequential basis, led to a contraction in the average rate per million.\nI want to clarify that although the rate we capture has decline due to an increase in the mix of high turnover participants, we have been able to substantially grow the higher-paying customer base as well, which includes asset managers and insurance companies.\nDuring the third quarter, the total notional amount cleared by this customer segment was up 115% sequentially, with revenue up 94%.\nIn comparison, during the same time frame, the total notional amount cleared by the high turnover participant base was up 138%, and revenue was up 125%.\nOverall, as Gill noted, we are pleased to see IRS in dealer-to-client market share jump from 5% in Q1 to 33% so far in Q4.\nOur Q3 interest rate product line revenue was up 32% to $181 million. And if you add the incremental interest rate swap revenue, the total rates related revenue was up 40%. That's our thinking about this business.\nThe OTC clearing business is strengthening our overall interest rate franchise.\nMoving on. Total third quarter operating expense was $314 million, which included a foreign exchange benefit of $12 million, reversing the Q1 FX expense of the same amount.\nExcluding the FX benefit, as well as other items noted in the reconciliation, expenses would have been $325 million. As you'll recall, I guided to a higher expense level for the second half, and that is playing out.\nA couple of different areas that impacted us this quarter. The primary contributor to the sequential increase was in professional fees, which tends to have more variability than other expense lines from quarter-to-quarter. This was up $7.7 million versus prior quarter, due to an increase in IT and legal consulting fees, higher market studies expense and higher public relations and brand consulting fees.\nWithin the compensation line, we had $3.2 million of deferred comp expense based on the strength of the equity market during the quarter. Keep in mind that this expense is offset 100% in the interest income line.\nLastly, in Q3, license fees did not fall as much as would be expected from the seasonal decrease in equity volumes, as we are now recording our OTC revenue share expense in this line item.\nTurning to nonoperating income. The main thing to point out is interest expense dropped from $39 million to $35 million based on the pay-down of $750 million of debt in August. We expect that to increase back to $40 million in Q4 based on full quarter impact of the debt we took on in early September and an increase in our clearing house credit facility.\nThe total interest expense and borrowing cost line is expected to drop by $30 million in 2014 to approximately $123 million from $153 million this year.\nWe had put in place an interest rate lock in August of 2012, which generated $128 million, which is included in our current cash balance, and which also reduces the all-in accounting effective rate on our recent 30-year bond issuance by about 50 basis points to 4.8% per year.\nWith respect to taxes, excluding the FX impact and noncash deferred tax items, as well as other prior year tax benefits, the effective tax rate was 35.6% this quarter.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We had almost $1.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, along with an additional $750 million held in cash for the February 2014 debt pay-down.\nDuring the third quarter, capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $36 million, bringing us to $91 million so far this year.\nIn terms of guidance, I said last quarter we expected 2013 expenses to range from $1.25 billion to $1.26 billion, and I anticipate that expenses in Q4 will be close to $325 million, which means we expect to be nearer $1.26 billion, including $6 million of deferred compensation expense year-to-date.\nIn terms of CapEx, I expect between $130 million and $140 million for the year, which is down from my prior estimate.\nWithin market data, we recently announced to clients we are expanding our fees for professional screen from $70 per month to $85 per month beginning in January 2014.\nWe are making very good progress in the sale of our building in New York City. Contrary to some media reports, we have not yet closed the transaction, although we are working diligently to complete it by year end. Assuming we close it, we plan to include the net proceeds in our annual variable dividend.\nFor modeling purposes, you should know our cost basis for tax purposes is fairly low, so apply our tax rate to whatever you assume we will sell the building for to arrive at estimated cash flow.\nIn contrast, there will likely be a loss for GAAP purposes as the building had been revalued on our balance sheet at the time we merged with NYMEX.\nLastly, we've made some great progress on the tax front. We had previously guided in the 38% to 39% range. At this point, we expect 37% to 38% going forward in Q4 and beyond.\nIn summary, we continue to focus on investing for the future. In particular, we have positioned ourselves to fully take advantage of the changing regulatory and competitive landscape, as well as the medium-term favorable cyclical trends.\nAs always, while investing in our future, we also remain intensely focused on generating excess capital and returning it to our shareholders.\nWith that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions.\n[Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.\nRichard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division\nMy question is on the OTC, Jamie. So it looks like in the quarter was really the tail of whatever 1 month -- or it was improved overall, but you're doing roughly $60 billion in the first 2 months and then $120 billion average in September. So I guess, the question is on the rate, what was the rate exiting when you really did -- when you jumped the average clearing level up to $120 billion? Was it above the $2.15 rate per million we calculate right now for the quarter?\nJames E. Parisi\nRich, if you look at the interest rate swap rate for the quarter, excluding CDS, we're around $2.70 per million for the quarter. And as we said in the -- as I said in my remarks, there was an increase -- bigger increase in the high turnover players than there were -- than there was in the real money players, resulting in kind of that decrement versus the prior quarter. Also in the quarter, we saw some of the shorter-dated products like FRAs and OIS grow as a percentage of the volumes. So there were about 22% of volume in Q1. They've grown to about 33% in Q3, and we're continuing to see that mix grow somewhat. And in September, it did grow versus August, and we did see a growth in the higher turnover relative to the real money in September as well. So likely, you would see a decrease in the September rate going coming out of the quarter.\nRichard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division\nOkay. And would that continue into -- October's running at about $100 billion. So similar trend, is that fair to say?\nJames E. Parisi\nI haven't dived down into the October numbers yet. So it's hard for me to say exactly. But you'd think that those trends look like they were moving in that direction, so perhaps. Just overall, we're very pleased with the business, pleased to see the growth that we're getting there. And as Gill mentioned, it's really, I think, helping us in our core.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nHoward Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\nA question for Jamie as well, this one on the variable dividend. Jamie, cash continues to build up nicely. Can you just update us on how much cash and working capital you'd like to hold for the business and tuck in acquisitions? And should we think of the $128 million of proceeds from that August interest rate swap lock as eligible for this year's variable dividend something you also want to pay back to shareholders?\nJames E. Parisi\nYes. Thanks, Howard. Yes, on the proceeds from the interest rate lock. That would just go into the cash balance that we would consider for a return. We haven't changed our guidance on the amount of cash we want to hold. Minimally, we want to have $700 million on the balance sheet to cover our skin in the game in the various financial safeguards package -- packages, as well as to have a little bit of cushion there. So that hasn't changed at all.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nI guess, a little bit more big picture. I think one of the things Gill highlighted was the excitement about the options and the really strong growth there. So maybe you can give us a little bit more detail what really this is driving? I mean, is this just the macro-environment? Because you had talked about the low volatility environment little bit. But how much are you actually driving this to? I think a few years ago, there was a huge drive to get options a little bit more electronic. Are you educating your customer base more? So I guess, what I'm getting is, is this more macro? Or is this -- do you think this growth is sustainable and will continue even in a better, more volatile environment?\nPhupinder S. Gill\nAlex, this is Gill. I'm going to start, and I'm going to ask Mr. Sean Tully and Derek Sammann to add in their particular asset classes. I think, on both of those notes that you mentioned, there is a big macro affect, where the direction is clear, but the timing of the direction is not clear. So in times of uncertainties, such as those options become a very valuable tool. Regarding the electronification of options, it has been an effort of ours, particularly, I would say, in the last 9 months or so. And if you -- the results there across all the asset classes. Sean or Derek, would you like to add?\nDerek Sammann\nSean, you're on the rates side?\nSean Tully\nSure. If I could jump in on the rate side, I think the question was in terms of the macro pictures, as well as driving the volumes. In terms of driving the volumes, over the last few years, we bid in a number of new interest rate options products. We added the weekly treasury options, the long green Eurodollar options, the blue mid-curve options, the gold mid-curve options, the purple mid-curve options. So we have been driving with increased product relative to the macro-environment. There's no question, the macro-environment has been very helpful, while the Eurodollar options in Q3 of this year versus Q3 of last year was up 54%. We had red mid-curves, for example, up 265%, and green mid-curves -- these are, again, mid-curves on the Eurodollar options, up 262%. But in addition to that, if we look at new products on the interest rate side, mostly options based over the last 3 years, they've contributed 315,000 ADV in Q3.\nDerek Sammann\nAnd just adding to that, I think, taking a step back in terms of the broader options business, we transacted a little over 2.2 million contracts in our options across-the-board across asset classes, and what we're recognizing is the scale and the scope of our cross-asset options is unique to this business. It's also unique in that volumes on the options side drives income from volumes for the delta hedgers into our futures business as well. So that incremental increase of electronification from 43% from 35% last year is significant and very intentional on the part of our sales teams in our effort to approach the market with a broader options sales pitch and the core capabilities that CME Group has across asset classes. You'll see here more from us on our overall options business going forward.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.\nJillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.\nSo you guys, from what I recall, haven't changed your pricing tiers and rates, products since -- I want to say, since 2008. And more recently, you've had some really strong volume periods. And particularly on the long and the mid-curve, I think you're tracking above precrisis volume levels for 2013. So I just wanted to kind of see what your thoughts are on the potential opportunities for raising volume tiers, especially in the treasury products, just given the more positive volume outlook?\nJames E. Parisi\nYes. This is Jamie, Jillian. I think you're absolutely right. Before the crisis hit roughly every 18 months or so, because of the way the volumes are growing, we were adjusting our tiers, particularly on the interest rate products. We pulled back from that, obviously, during the crisis as our customers were suffering as well. But as we come out and as we see sustained growth in those volumes, we'll certainly be taking a look at that.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDaniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division\nI guess, Jamie, just thinking about expenses, maybe into -- even into next year when you're budgeting, if we look at kind of the last few years and the revenue environment, assume that continues into next year, is there any either step-up, step-down or movement in expenses that you would highlight, given kind of the investments you guys have been making and potentially need to make going forward?\nJames E. Parisi\nI think what you've heard us say before is over the long run, we would anticipate our expenses to grow in the mid-single digits. I don't anticipate it being too different than that in the coming year. Certainly, we've been making investments over the last several years in growth opportunities, so those -- many of those are already built into our base, although there are, obviously, incremental expenses as we grow those offerings further. So I don't see any giant moves. I mean, one of the things I highlighted in my comments was the -- while overall interest expense is lower, there is a higher expense next year because we have a significant increase in our clearing house credit facility. Going into next year, that will be one thing that we'll add, as an example, but will look for other ways to control expenses.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Neve Alexander with KBW.\nNiamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nThe residual interest -- I guess, the CFTC just passed last week, say, various consumer protections. But one of the issues that's been kind of a discussion topic among all the FCMs has been the residual interest requirement and how that's going to significantly increase the capital they'd be required to keep. And we think it's going to be really tough for some of the smaller FCMs to stay in the business to that effect. How do you think about how these impact your business? Because I've heard how your chairman's presented to regulators their thoughts on it, and it didn't seem very positive. So help me think about, okay, it's been passed, so what's next and how to think about potential impacts?\nPhupinder S. Gill\nNeve, Terry Duffy is on the line. Terry, are you there?\nTerrence A. Duffy\nYes, I'm here, Gill. Do you want me to start, Gill, or no?\nPhupinder S. Gill\nSure.\nTerrence A. Duffy\nNeve, on that residual interest, and as you know, we felt that was a very flawed proposal from the beginning. We worked very closely with the smaller FCMs and with the agricultural community. I testified just as well as 2 weeks ago with the agricultural community and other participants, and it was the first time in my 20-year history that I've seen all sides -- both sides of the aisle agree that this rule was not -- it was fought with all kinds of dangers, and it was, obviously, the CFTC took notice, and they switched to the rule, which was originally an FIA proposal, which has nothing for the first -- next year, so it will stay as the same as it is. And then it'll go to the T1 at 6:00 p.m. the following day, and then 5 years from now, it could go to 9:00 a.m. So that's 5 years away that could happen. We're going to continually work with ag groups and with the CFTC and with the folks on the Hill to make sure that we get the 5-year piece removed from this. It makes no sense. If it made any sense at all, they would have been posted on day 1, not 5 years down the road. So we feel fairly confident that this residual interest rule is basically dead.\nPhupinder S. Gill\nNeve, if I can add, I think the CFTC, to the Chairman's point, has also committed to complete an analysis in the next 2.5 years or so. And I think the experience that the FCM community shares in the next 2.5 years is going to be important with respect to what the CFTC would decide. So the compromised solution that they came up with was to extend the time. I think the next few years is going to be very important here.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMC.\nKenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nJust on the interest rate swap volume. It still seems pretty tepid versus original investor and also market participant expectations. I guess, first, do you share this view? Second, is there an explanation? I guess this could just be early days, and there's more volume to come, or maybe there's something that we've all just been missing. And then third, given the size of the OTC market, there would still seem to be the potential for meaningful upside like orders of magnitude, better volumes than we're seeing today. Is that potential still realistic? Or based on what we have seen and maybe now know, is that really off the table?\nPhupinder S. Gill\nKen, I'll ask Sean to chime in on this.\nSean Tully\nSure. I think we've seen very good growth. If you look at our market share this year, it went from 5% in Q1 to 14% in Q2 to 31% in Q3 and 33% so far in Q4. So we have seen a very good growth. That 33% market share is of the dealer-to-customer business, and obviously, that's being driven out of the Dodd-Frank regulations where we've seen a Category 1, Category 2, Category 3 phases this year. We do expect further growth. We do expect increased -- hope for an increased market share. But in addition to that, we will see increasing products. As Mr. Gill have mentioned earlier, we're now clearing 17 different currencies, but we'll be -- we will continue to increase our product scope with increases -- we will be adding emerging -- some additional emerging marked currencies in the near future. And there will be other OTC products that we'll be adding. In addition to that, you have to look for Europe. The mandate to clear has not yet hit Europe, and we expect the mandate to hit Europe, probably, the end of 2014 or sometime in 2015. So with the increased product scope, increased market share, as well as increased requirements to clear, we think there's a lot of runway.\nKenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nOkay. But Europe is about 1/2 the market though, and we're clearing $100 billion a day. That doesn't -- still doesn't get to the orders of magnitude that the size of the market might have originally suggested. Any thoughts there?\nSean Tully\nYes. We've been focused on the dealer-to-customer business. Obviously, the dealer-to-dealer business is quite large as well. And we believe that with our portfolio margining, we have a unique value proposition, where people can portfolio margin between CME's interest rate futures and our -- the swaps cleared at CME Group. We believe that we'll be able to penetrate other parts of the market as well.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChristopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\nJust a numbers question here. The fee increase you're going to be expecting in market data beginning next year, what kind of impact do you expect that to have on revenue?\nJames E. Parisi\nIf you were just to hold terminals constant, which you have to make your own estimates about that, but if you held terminals constant, I want to say it's roughly a $50 million impact on revenues next year, again, assuming that you don't see a decrement in terminals as a result.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.\nChristopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division\nActually, if I could just follow-up on that question a little bit. The fee increase per screen, it's about 21% this time versus roughly about 12% increase for the last 2x you increased it. I'm just wondering: a, what's driven the magnitude of the increase here? And also if could you give us any sense in terms of what's been the usual screen decline when you see in your revenue -- I'm sorry, the rate increases before?\nJames E. Parisi\nSure. When you look at the rate that we're putting in -- the new rate that we're putting in place, it's, I'd say, very competitive. In fact, I want to say it's below what some of the key competitors have out there now or what they've announced. So we feel very comfortable around that. If we look at what's happened in the past around terminals, it very much depends on the environment that we're in. If you went back several rate increases ago, you wouldn't really have seen much of an impact on the number of terminals. The last one, you probably did see more of an impact, but it's also coupled with some legacy -- issues around some legacy incentives that we have in place, and we're taking a look at those as well.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nHoward Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\nJust broad regulatory question. We've seen some stops and starts for the CFTC SEF mandate. With, I think, the expiration of the no action in the last week, I was just hoping you could talk about what you're seeing in the market and what you're hearing from customers.\nPhupinder S. Gill\nHoward, this is Gill. I'll stop, and I'll ask Kim to add as she's been working with a lot of the firms. I think on the SEF front, they're still in the very early stage -- stages, a lot of FCM, in particular, are a little bit concerned about the lack of consistent rules and a lot of these so-called SEFs have. The SEFs are working very closely with both their clients, as well as the FCMs to try and get these trades done. There's some confusion when trades coming from a SEF versus from some other venue. It doesn't give the FCMs, particularly the large FCMs, enough time to accept the trades. That's one example. So there's a lot of what I'll call early stage pains that both FCMs, as well as client and SEFs are going through, and those things will shake themselves out in the coming weeks.\nKimberly S. Taylor\nThe only thing that I would add as another example of the way that the SEF mandate is changing the way business is done. And actually, we're very well positioned to benefit from this change in this particular respect and with regard to bunched orders. The execution of very large orders, and then the allocation of those orders out to multiple accounts, the way that the workflow for that occurred prior to the SEF mandate is very different from the way that the customers want it to occur going forward, and we've already been able to accommodate the ability to do what I'll call post-clearing allocations of bunched orders, which was a new service, and being very well received.\nHoward Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\nAnd my second follow-up, Gill, you highlighted the global expansion. I was hoping you could just dig a little bit deeper into Brazil, specifically in your various partnerships with BM&FBOVESPA and give us a deeper update there.\nPhupinder S. Gill\nSure, Howard. The growth rate for Latin America is very high. The base volume that we are working off is still low. It's about $60 million, I think, we're going to get in for the year. The Brazilian environment, as you know, continues to be a challenging one, and we are working with both the exchange, as well as the various regulators there to talk about the timing of the change -- changes of some tax laws that have to take place before the Brazilians can take advantage of what we are offering. I'm also going to ask Bryan to chat a little bit on what he's seeing there.\nBryan T. Durkin\nIn anticipation of change occurring from the macro-environment, we've really intensified our efforts in developing central bank programs. So we're -- we've got boots on the ground where we're intensifying the educational efforts and the draw of business into our panoply of products. So we're very pleased to see the growth trends, given the fairly muted environment that we're working under and just positioning ourselves for that change.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nA couple of follow-ups for me, too. First of all, Jamie, from -- on the licensing fees, you talked about, I think, the OTC revenue sharing there. But in general, can you just maybe remind us what's in there and maybe the magnitude of the differences just in terms of the equity, fees with S&P and the ClearPort OTC fees and then also, I guess, on the clearing side, or whatever else is in there and how that's been trending?\nJames E. Parisi\nSure. On the -- you hit all the main components. It's the equity license fees from S&P, NASDAQ, Dow, et cetera, are in there. You've got the ClearPort fee sharing, and you've got this, now, the OTC revenue sharing. So generally, I'd say the equity license fees are the largest component, followed by the energy component and then followed by the OTC share. Just to be clear, in this quarter, the OTC revenue share amount that we booked in there included some catch-up for prior quarters as well.\nAlex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nOkay. But you can't give us exact numbers or anything close in terms of percentages?\nJames E. Parisi\nNo.\nAlex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nAnd then secondly, just coming back to, I think, Howard's original question on the dividend and the appetite there. I mean, it looks like you have, I mean, significant cash buildup, and there will be more by the time you want to pay this dividend. So if you think about the variable dividend, do you really still see or does the board when you talk to them still view this as a true variable onetime? Or could you make an argument where you should bring it up in nice amounts from last quarter, and then maybe over from last year, and then maybe start thinking about repurchases a little bit more again? Or is this really just, this is what it's going to be and expect most of us to be paid out?\nJames E. Parisi\nI would say that the philosophical bend is absolutely towards the dividends, so I wouldn't expect any buybacks of any significant nature going forward, at least in the near term. And it's the -- you called -- you said onetime around that dividend, but it is really an annual variable recurring dividend. So I think it's a bit of a unique structure, as we've discussed before. And I'd say both the board and the management is very comfortable with the way that's been working out.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChristopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\nBroader finance question. How should we expect your capital needs to change as your swaps business gets larger?\nJames E. Parisi\nThe amount -- you mean, our capital requirements on the organization?\nChristopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\nExactly.\nJames E. Parisi\nI don't see them changing all that significantly. The capital requirements tend to be, for the most part, tied to the size of the annual expense for the business. So I don't see large increases there. And then we also size our contribution to the financial safeguards package in a very conservative fashion, so we feel very comfortable with the amount that we've got there as well.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.\nJillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.\nOn portfolio margining, I know you said 6 clearing members are live, but I just want to get an idea for what percentage of your business that represents. Like, are we talking about 10% or 15% of your cleared interest rates swaps that's benefiting from that now? Or is it 50% or more?\nPhupinder S. Gill\nThis is Gill. That 6 clearing members and their participation is yielding about $1 billion worth of margin savings, and it's currently a small percentage of the overall business. So firms are still coming up to speed there.\nJillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.\nDoes that -- does the rollout of that, I guess, to a larger percentage of your business, does that mean that you're going to gain more share? Is that your expectation? Or do you think that everybody's kind of already baking that eventuality into where they're doing their business right now?\nPhupinder S. Gill\nI think from an anticipation point of view, a lot of firms have started to test how this would actually work because it can be -- unless you have automated the process, it can be very manually intensive. So what a lot of firms have been doing over the last 6 months or so is making sure they have the process to automate those spreads. The opportunity beyond the existing open interest on the rate side against the OTC open interest is on a going-forward basis, as firms can put on or clients can put on positions that are risk-minimizing or risk-neutral on a going-forward basis and eventually get to an optimized state, where they can use some portion of their business will be in futures and options, and some portion would be in swaps. So there are 2 ways to look at this opportunity: one, with respect to the existing open interest in the futures side; and secondly, on a going-forward basis, with the deliverable swap futures, the clearing of the swaps, and more development on the futures side would be the opportunity that our firms would have.\nJames E. Parisi\nAnd just to add on to that. I mean, I think, we have to keep in mind that we're just off the heels of the mandate states themselves. And so in our interaction through our sales calls, the firms are saying, \"Look, first and foremost, we need to make sure that we just got compliant.\" Now we're really spending our time on how to most effectively utilize our capital and any opportunities that you have. Specifically from a margin savings perspective, we're very keen to be able to test and see how that benefits our firm. So we're going through that optimization phase now.\nJillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.\nOkay. And then just -- can you update us on the London exchange? I think it's been delayed a couple of times. I'm not sure exactly why and what the expectation is for that.\nPhupinder S. Gill\nYes. This is Gill. The delay has to do with a technical issues surrounding the delivery of foreign exchange. So we are working very hard with the Bank of England and the FCA, and we hope to have an announcement very soon there.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.\nRichard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division\nJust to follow up, I guess, on regulation for Terry. And it looks like the EUREX has put in some curves or very, what do you call it, far-out curves on high-frequency trading on order trade ratios and usage fees. And I guess, the question, Terry, do you think this is just their response to pressure that was just geographical in Germany? Or do you think that this is a trend that you guys might look at? And I know the equity exchanges didn't really follow up through, but you do got the concept release. So I guess, what do you think of what EUREX is doing in that area?\nTerrence A. Duffy\nRich, I don't have the detailed information on what EUREX did. I can only go off what I've said publicly and what others have said publicly. We think that HFT trading as deposal liquidity, which benefits the participants and duly risk transfer at the lowest cost price. So we focus on the regulatory issues around HFT, and then make sure that we can show confidence in the marketplace that nothing nefarious is going on, and we've done a really good job doing that, and we're going to continue to support that model. There's no reason for us to change our structure right now as it relates to HFTs -- because again, we think they had deposal liquidity to the marketplace. So again, I'm not up to speed. Others in the room might have a better idea of what EUREX did.\nJames E. Parisi\nI would just add to what the chairman just stated that the main focus of what we're looking at in the context of this whole topic is ensuring that you have the appropriate risk management mechanisms in place, many of which we're -- we've been an industry leader in dealing with credit controls, dealing with a appropriate level of order-to-trade ratios in terms of messaging policies, to maintain the efficiency of the experience for all users on a platform. So from our perspective, I think, as the chairman indicated, we've held a pretty firm line in that respect in terms of the benefits of this type of user base, but ensuring that we have the appropriate protocols in place to ensure a consistent experience for all market users.\nTerrence A. Duffy\nLet me just follow-on real quick because what I will say is, as you know, we've dealt a lot with over speculations in the energy markets over the last several years. We're in Washington quite a bit as you know. I do think that you will see a lot of headlines as relates to the HFTs that we have over the last several months. That won't go away. That doesn't mean anything's going to change, but the headlines will still remain to be there.\nOperator\nAnd our final question comes from Neve Alexander with KBW.\nNiamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\nI guess, maybe, if you could pick which one you want to answer then or maybe I'll get both, but the access fees and collocations, things like that. And that had been something that you had been guiding to grow as you build out the data center, and that was something kind of you have been investing in for some years. So can you help me there, Jamie, and think about the growth potential in that revenue line? And then you've mentioned it in your prepared remarks as well, and I'm wondering if Sean might or Derek might address it, it's just some anecdotal evidence of futures instead of swaps. I mean, what data points are you looking at for evidence of this? I mean, you're closest to it. We're watching open interest as well. But what are the areas could you point to us to kind of look at, maybe some futures credit instead of swaps, instead of just clearing swaps as the way of your kind of revenue growth?\nJames E. Parisi\nOn that first one, Neve, I'll just say we're not prepared to give any updated guidance around collo. Certainly, we saw kind of people rationalizing the space that they were taking the facility. We have seen some customer growth there. And you just keep in mind that it is still a very profitable business for us. I want to say the margins this last quarter were well -- were over 50% in that business. So as you know, very -- it's a very good addition for us, and it's going to be market driven. So we'll continue to wait to see where the demand comes from and look for new ways to leverage that facility. Yes, Sean. Sean, you want to add a little -- talk on that second point?\nSean Tully\nSure. In terms of the move of people into our futures complex, we're seeing it in a couple of different ways. We look at a cash penetration -- or cash market penetration of our treasury futures. That is a metric that we've been following for a number of years. We recently reached a new peak in that. And although that's fallen off a bit in the last couple of months, we do remain around the peak level. So we did exceed the 2007 peak. Another way, anecdotally, that we look at this is we can look at EFRs, or exchange for risk transactions, which are spread trades between CME treasury futures and interest rate swaps. In the kind of traditional interest rate swap world, a very popular trade is in interest rate spread or a transaction which is an interest rate swap traded as a spread to a cash treasury instrument. In the new world, it's far more efficient to represent that trade as a CME cleared interest rate swap against the CME interest rate future. So our way of representing it now represents nearly the same risk, but you can get up to 85% margin savings relative to the portfolio margining that we talked about earlier. In terms of EFRs, if you look at volumes in 2013, overall year-to-date volumes in 2013 versus 2012, average daily volume in 2012 was about 19,000 a day. 2013 was about 48,000 a day so far. So we're seeing a very large increase in people beginning to look at ways to use our unique value proposition, I think, for the portfolio margining with interest rate swaps, plus our futures complex, to represent strategies that have been in place for a long time, but in a much more efficient manner.\nJames E. Parisi\nJust a couple of things to add to that. The member, nonmember mix has trended positively over the last few months. In interest rates, you've seen a pickup of about a 1% nonmember mix there in this quarter versus last year. And then finally, as we noted in the prepared remarks, the interest rate revenue is up 40% in total versus last year. So I think all those are supportive of what Sean was pointing out.\nOperator\nI think, at this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.\nPhupinder S. Gill\nWell, thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you in the next quarter. Thanks very much.\nOperator\nThank you, and this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your line.\n\n",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded for replay purposes.\nI'd like to turn the call over to Craig Felenstein who's the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nCraig Felenstein\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery Communications' Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Hopefully the timing of our release did not interfere too much with your election day plans.\nJoining me today is David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer.\nYou should have received our earnings release. But if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com.\nOn today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy.

Zaslav\nThanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. And before we begin the call, on behalf of myself and the entire team at Discovery, I wanted to extend our thoughts and best wishes to everyone who has been impacted by Hurricane Sandy. It's been quite a week.\nDiscovery's financial momentum continued during the third quarter as our sustained investment in developing high-quality content and building bigger brands of global appeal allowed us to capitalize on the relatively healthy worldwide ad environment and the further penetration of pay-television around the world. Investing in great series and specials in those geographic areas that provide the greatest advertising and affiliate opportunities has been a consistent strategic priority for Discovery and a key factor in our strong and dependable growth over the last few years.\nOur third quarter results were skewed by several one-off items, which Andy will discuss when he covers our financial performance, but the sustainable organic growth story remains robust.\nInternational expansion continues at a rapid pace as we broaden our global content offerings and capitalize on our unparalleled distribution platform, while domestically, targeted programming initiatives are delivering audience growth at several of our emerging networks and we continue to see market share gains across the portfolio. Though investing in bigger, stronger brands remains paramount, we remain committed to our success-based investment style. We do not just throw dollars against the wall and see what sticks. But rather, by incrementally spending on those brands that have demonstrated meaningful upside, we can maximize the best possible return on our programming dollars.\nThere's no better example of this than Investigation Discovery. ID was launched back in January 2008 with the view that mystery and forensic content was compelling enough and had a sufficient audience base to be the linchpin for an entire network. But before investing significantly in the concept, we wanted to test whether this type of programming would resonate with viewers, so we seeded it with a little bit of money and launched ID off the distribution of Discovery Times.\nIn the first year, our cash spend only increased marginally, but the reception from viewers was immediate. We then went out and hired cable veteran Henry Schleiff, spent a little bit on marketing, attracted top storytellers to the genre and continued to incrementally invest in content. Since 2008, we have more than doubled the number of original hours on ID and the return has been significant.\nID's audience has more than tripled during that period, and critically, we have been able to monetize that audience, with advertising up more than 6-fold over the same time period. Our investment continues to pay off, with viewership on ID up nearly 30% this past quarter in Total Day among its key women 25 to 54 demo. It is now a top 6 network in America during the day for women. And thus far in 2012, it is one of our largest drivers of advertising growth domestically. We still have significant room to grow before we achieve pricing and volume parity with the ratings ID is delivering. However, ID has clearly become one of Discovery's flagships, and we will continue to incrementally invest in the brand both in the U.S., as well as around the world. In just the last year, we have taken ID into over 130 countries.\nAnimal Planet is another network that has really broken out. Since 2008, we have increased its original content by nearly 30%, and the audience is up a healthy 46%. When the growth took a breather in 2011, we deliberately held back on further increasing its content budget to see if the Animal Planet brand would regain its momentum and continue to grow. The answer was a resounding yes, with viewership up nearly 20% year-to-date, including its best-ever third quarter led by returning favorites Call of the Wildman, Tanked and My Cat from Hell. Given their momentum, we will continue investing additional programming dollars in Animal Planet as the audience growth is translating into significant advertising revenue gains.\nIn addition to Animal Planet and ID, we are also seeing growth in several other emerging networks that we're investing incrementally in during 2012, including viewership gains this past quarter of over 20% at the recently re-branded Destination America, 55% viewership gains at Velocity and over 15% gains at the Science Channel.\nThere's been lots of talk about cable channel ratings declines, but when you look at the success across our younger networks, it is clear that our strategy is working. By investing wisely and delivering high-quality content that is unique and engaging, we can grow audience, increase market share and deliver additional value to advertising and affiliate partners.\nSimilarly, as we invest in our emerging networks, we continue to support our 2 established flagship brands, Discovery and TLC. We mentioned on our last call that the third quarter presented some hurdles, with the Olympics and soft ratings early in the quarter. But we captured some real momentum with the most successful Shark Week ever, starting in mid-August on Discovery, and followed that up with the successful return of Sons of Guns and new hits Bering Sea Gold: Under the Ice and Yukon Men, which helped Discovery deliver viewership gains of 8% post Olympics.\nThe fourth quarter is also off to a great start, with October viewership up 13% in primetime, led by the premiere of Gold Rush, which was the #1 show in all of television among adults 25 to 54, beating all the cable and broadcast networks on Friday night.\nTLC also captured some significant ratings momentum after the Olympics led by the breakout phenomenon, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which tapped into cultural zeitgeist and averaged nearly 2.5 million viewers across its season.\nHoney Boo Boo was not the only success on TLC during the quarter. Long Island Medium returned as the #1 ranked program in its time slot, with viewership more than doubling its first season. Equally as important, we were able to use that success to launch Breaking Amish, which averaged over 3 million viewers and was TLC's highest rated new series in nearly a decade.\nTLC was up 17% in primetime during September, and that momentum continued into the fourth quarter, with October also delivering 17% growth year-on-year.\nWith Discovery and TLC gaining real programming strength from great original content and with the emerging nets growing their audiences nearly across the board, we were able to deliver our best October ever. Viewership for the overall portfolio was up 17% in primetime, and this increased market share, along with a strong upfront and a scatter market that looks to be relatively healthy, gives us confidence that we can deliver sustained advertising gains moving forward.\nWe're also seeing some impressive growth at our joint ventures. The Hub delivered 62% viewership growth this past quarter in Total Day among kids 2 to 11, its best quarter ever. Lastly, we continue to see big ratings momentum at OWN. Building upon the 18% increase it delivered in the first half the year, OWN grew nearly 60% in the third quarter among women 25 to 54, led by record ratings for its flagship series Oprah's Next Chapter, as well as strong premieres from Iyanla: Fix My Life and Welcome to Sweetie Pie's.\nIn addition, last month, OWN announced a partnership with Tyler Perry, award-winning actor, director, screenwriter, playwright and producer, to become Tyler's exclusive home for all-new television series and projects, demonstrating the power of the Oprah brand to attract some of the biggest names in entertainment. Two of Tyler's series will debut next year and will give the network another strong night to build audience share and launch new franchises.\nExecuting on our investment strategy domestically has allowed us to deliver sustained growth over the last several years in what is obviously a more mature and competitive U.S. market. The more robust opportunity continues to be International, where we are launching new channels, growing audiences and building stronger brands globally as we exploit our unparalleled market position in over 200 countries.\nSimilar to the U.S., we are focusing our investments in areas that represent the biggest opportunities from an audience, advertising and affiliate perspective. A good example over the last few years has been our emphasis on broadening the female demographics across our International platform. The first step was establishing a female flagship brand across the globe, much like we have here in the U.S. Given the vast distribution network already in place, we were confident we could take predominantly existing shelf space, utilize a fair amount of library content and strategically increase our programming commitment to create the #1 most distributed female brand in the world. And we've done just that. Over the last 2 years, our female flagship has been rolled out to over 150 countries, now reaches nearly 300 million subscribers and is delivering real viewership growth, with audience up 51% versus a year ago.\nAs we mentioned on the last call, our most recent initiative, given the success of crime and investigation genre across our existing platforms, is driving the ID brand in markets where we think it will have broad appeal. Last quarter, we launched ID in 38 countries throughout Latin America, and ID is now in over 130 countries globally, reaching more than 60 million subscribers. And we think our investment in this genre will be another growth driver for our International business over the next several years.\nThe investments in TLC and ID, along with further investment in Discovery Kids and targeted local content, has dramatically increased female viewership and, in turn, has enabled us to significantly grow Discovery's share of female-targeted advertising dollars.\nAnother driver of ad growth for us continues to be our targeted investments across Western Europe. While the market is certainly slowing in some of these countries, we continue to deliver double-digit ad growth across Western Europe, led by Real Time and DMAX in Italy, Quest in the U.K. and Discovery MAX in Spain.\nOur primary investment focus remains strengthening the pay-tv channels across our International footprint, but the free-to-air networks we have launched are an excellent example of our ability to identify market opportunities and exploit them with our globally relevant content. As we look for ways to take additional viewership and advertising share around the world, we continue to exploit the further penetration of pay-tv worldwide.\nThe subscriber base across our International business expanded over 17% versus a year ago led by Brazil and Mexico and Latin America and Russia and Poland in Central and Eastern Europe. With subscribers growing across the globe, we are delivering broad-based affiliate revenue growth with every region this quarter, delivering double-digit gains versus a year ago.\nGiven the relatively low penetration levels worldwide, we fully expect continued pay-tv growth moving forward. But with boots on the ground across the globe as these platforms further proliferate, we are ideally situated to maximize the opportunity they provide. Building new brands and strengthening our global content pipeline to capitalize on our core growth opportunities is still our first strategic priority.\nHowever, given the sustained financial momentum, the free cash flow we are generating, the strength of our balance sheet and the growth profile of our company as we invest in our underlying assets, we have also been buying back shares aggressively. Returning capital to shareholders remains a focus, and we will continue to do so if it is the best use of our balance sheet and we will further build shareholder value.\nDiscovery has delivered sustained financial momentum throughout the first 3 quarters of 2012, further demonstrating our ability to capitalize on the opportunities across our global distribution platform and the strength of our current operating environment. At the same time, we are investing further in building out our diverse set of brands and platforms around the world in order to expand our market share and deliver additional value to our shareholders over the long term.\nAnd now let me turn the call over to Andy.\nCraig Felenstein\nThanks, David. As David touched upon his comments, Discovery's underlying financial momentum continued during the third quarter as we further executed upon our strategic initiatives in a relatively favorable operating environment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Discovery delivered another quarter of revenue and OIBDA growth, despite the upside a year ago from the Netflix licensing agreement.\nOn a reported basis, total company revenue was slightly below prior year, but organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of licensing agreements and currency movements, was up over 8%, led by 15% international growth and complemented by 5% higher domestic revenues.\nTotal operating expenses in the quarter were down 5% compared to the prior year as increased personnel costs were more than offset by our lower impairment charges, the impact of currency and the absence of expenses related to the Netflix agreement a year ago. Excluding the impairment charges, expenses associated with the licensing agreement and the impact of foreign exchange, total company operating expenses increased 3% versus third quarter a year ago.\nDiscovery's continued ability to generate revenue growth in excess of expenses translated into a 4% increase in adjusted OIBDA during the third quarter on a reported basis as margins expanded by almost 200 basis points. Excluding the impact of licensing agreements, impairment charges and foreign currency, adjusted OIBDA grew 14%.\nNet income from continuing operations decreased to $214  million as the strong operating performance in the current year was more than offset by the net impact of prior year one-time items. Additionally, the current quarter included increased losses at our equity investments, higher mark-to-market share-based compensation, expense due to the appreciation in our share price and increased interest and tax expense.\nThe higher-than-normal tax rate in the quarter was primarily due to a restructuring at our international operations, which will ultimately lower our effective tax rate but which will also marginally raise our tax rate for the next several quarters. Please note that total net income in the current quarter also included a $9 million net of tax loss from discontinued operations through the sale of our Creative Sound Services business.\nFree cash flow increased 12% to $353 million in the third quarter as the improved operating performance was partially offset by higher content investment and increased cash taxes. As David mentioned, the increased programming spend in the current quarter is certainly paying off in terms of ratings momentum and higher advertising revenue.\nImportant to note, there will be a $50 million to $60 million increase in content expense next year as content amortization catches up with the cash spend in 2012. But we do anticipate programming spending growth will slow considerably in 2013.\nNow turning to the operating units. The U.S. networks continued to perform well during the third quarter. On a reported basis, total domestic revenues decreased 4% as advertising growth of 7% was more than offset by a decline in distribution revenue due to the execution of the Netflix agreement a year ago.\nExcluding licensing agreements, total domestic revenue growth and distribution revenue growth were both 5%.\nAs we mentioned on our last earnings call, advertising this quarter was negatively impacted by the Olympics as well as our soft July ratings, but reported ad revenue growth slightly exceeded our mid-single-digit growth guidance primarily due to sustained pricing strength and viewership gains across our portfolio after the Olympics.\nCurrent ad market trends continue to be encouraging, with sustained double-digit scatter pricing on top of the gains we garnered during this year's upfront negotiations. We have seen some pockets of softness with regard to volume, but the overall environment remains relatively healthy via some nice rate ratings momentum across many of our networks. As such, excluding a one-time revenue item we recognized in the fourth quarter a year ago, we anticipate ad sales growth in the high single digits this fourth quarter, building upon the impressive 17% organic growth we delivered a year ago.\nDomestic operating expenses were down 13% from the third quarter of 2011, which included $22 million in higher content impairment charges and $11 million in costs associated with extending and expanding digital licensing agreements.\nExcluding content impairment charges and costs associated with the digital licensing agreements, operating expenses actually declined 4% compared to a year ago due to lower content amortization and a decrease in marketing spend.\nOn a reported basis, domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 2%. Excluding the impact of licensing agreements and content impairment charges, domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 12% over the prior year.\nTurning to our international operations. We continue to deliver strong results across our global operations, with reported revenue expanding 7%, led by 8% affiliate and 3% ad growth. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, total revenue growth was 15%, with distribution revenue increasing 16% and advertising revenue up 10%.\nThe affiliate revenue growth, which included 5 percentage points, had benefited from lower launch support amortization, was driven further strong subscriber additions worldwide led by Latin America, with sustained progress in Brazil and Mexico, and by Central and Eastern Europe, with further development in areas such as Russia and Poland.\nOverall, the Discovery Channel, our most widely distributed network, expanded its subscribers 8% internationally versus a year ago.\nOn the advertising front, despite some meaningful slowdown during the Olympics, Discovery delivered growth across nearly all regions, led by double-digit gains in Western Europe, mainly from their free-to-air initiatives David mentioned. We also saw a nice growth in the quarter in Latin America. It is expected that advertising growth will accelerate into the mid-teens in Q4 as these one-time items abate.\nOperating costs at national were up 1% on a reported basis and 9% excluding the impact of foreign currency, primarily driven by higher content amortization, as well as increased personnel and infrastructure costs due to additional investment in growth initiatives and the build-out of our global platform to support our long-term growth expectations.\nOur International segment delivered 16% adjusted OIBDA growth, excluding the currency impact as our International team continued to generate strong revenue increases by thoughtfully investing in key growth initiatives.\nTurning to our full year forecast. We are adjusting our revenue expectations to reflect the disposal of the Creative Sound Services business as we now expect full year revenues to be between $4.475 billion and $4.525 billion. As we mentioned on our last call, we anticipated adjusted OIBDA growth to return to double digits in the fourth quarter, with full year guidance between $2.125 billion and $2.15 billion. While we are leaving the bottom end of the OIBDA range unchanged, as always, our overall OIBDA guidance is subject to meaningful changes in foreign exchange rates, ratings delivery and the advertising environment.\nIn addition to revenue, we are also adjusting net income expectations to reflect the higher stock compensation expense as a result of the increased stock price as well as the higher tax rate I mentioned earlier. Net income from continuing operations is now expected to be between $975 million and $1.025 billion.\nWith a strong balance sheet that includes almost $1.6 billion in cash and with our sustained positive financial and operating performance, we continue to return capital to shareholders through execution of our share repurchase program. Our first priority remains investing in our core business to drive sustained long-term growth, be it through investment in existing networks and platforms or through exploring external initiatives.\nGiven that we have not yet found sufficient opportunities with attractive financial returns, we accelerated utilizing the cash from the balance sheet, as well as cash generated from operations, to repurchase shares in the quarter.\nDiscovery repurchased over $450 million of stock during the third quarter, including $383 million of Class C shares and $71 million of Class A shares. We still prefer buying them for economical security but given SEC volume limitations and the attractiveness in our securities, we will continue to repurchase both classes of stock as need be.\nWe have bought back over $1.1 billion under our share repurchase program through the end of the third quarter 2012. And since November of 2010, we have repurchased almost 70 million shares in total, reducing the outstanding share count by over 16%.\nThat's it. Thanks again for your time this morning. And now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Please stand by for your first question, which comes from the line of John Janedis from UBS.\nJohn Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nIt's John Janedis. David, the free-to-air networks have been a great driver in Europe. Is there any way you can help us size the growth for you versus maybe the growth in the markets where you operate them? And in what inning do you think we're in on the growth curve there?\nDavid M. Zaslav\nThe free-to-air has really helped us in a slow market in Western Europe, no doubt. And it's because our model is quite good. We own all the content in those markets. And in particular, those markets have small pay-tv. So we're able to take content that only a small amount of the population has seen. And we'll pick up a stick or a broadcast network at a very low price, and then we could put content that cost us very little. For instance in Spain, we have very little original content; it's almost all library. And we've seen a lot of growth with Discovery MAX in Spain, and it's continuing to accelerate. Real Time in Italy is continuing to grow. It's now the #7 network in all of Italy. We also launched a men's network in Italy and our German free-to-air. It's a small piece of our overall strategy, but it's been very healthy for us because our costs are very low. And we have teams on the ground. They're already setting across multiple channels. And so it's given us a more heft and it's given us a more scale in those markets. It's not -- it really only works in markets were that pay-tv market is quite small. But we're starting to -- we are continuing to see growth, and I think that will help us over the next year or 2 in Western Europe. And when the market actually starts to pick up, you'll see an acceleration because of the number of channels that we have in that market.\nJohn Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nOkay. And maybe a separate question. You talked about increasing the number of hours in some of the emerging nets. Are we at a point now where there's more room to ad hours there? And has there been maybe much of a change in your cost per hour given the success of the programming?\nDavid M. Zaslav\nOne of the things that we do is, first, we have a different strategy than a number of other media companies. We're real believers that you could still build channels, and with good stories and good creative people and great characters, you can attract real audiences to these new channels. We've had real success by investing in Animal Planet, in Science, ID, which is now the #6 network in America for women. And so we have been investing in about 7 channels, but we have 13. And so what we're trying to do is in the channels that we haven't figured out yet exactly how to grow, we're reducing our spend. And on the channels that we think we have the right recipe, we're increasing it. One of the advantages we have with the channels that we've been leaning into, which is ID and Animal Planet and Science, is that all 3 of them play very well around the world. We have Science now in over 150 countries. We've launched ID in the last year to over 130 countries. And we have Animal Planet in almost 200. And so when we invest, we view it as a worldwide investment because we could take it all over the world. But we are very careful, and in some of the channels that aren't generating significant value, where we don't feel like we have the right brand or the right recipe, we're holding back.\nOperator\nThe next question we have comes from the line of David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nThe first question is on your guidance or your discussion of ad trends in the fourth quarter, you've kind of called out mid-single digits x a one-timer -- or I think high single digits x a one-timer in the fourth quarter. Could you just remind us of what that -- order of magnitude and what it was? The second question is, it's tough to get specific about one network, but I'm going to try and take another pass at it. Can you give us a sense of what percent of the growth of the overall business over the last couple of years that ID has driven and what is the likelihood that once that starts to kind of slow down, you see Destination America and you see Velocity, basically that you see catching lightning in a bottle and not worrying about anniversary-ing the lightning in a bottle of ID?\nDavid M. Zaslav\nI'll take the second question. And then, Andy, you.\nAndrew C. Warren\nSure.\nDavid M. Zaslav\nOn ID, I think we really have a very strong horse here that's going to deliver sustainable growth for a long period of time even if the ratings don't grow and they grew 30% in the last quarter, and we expect they will grow aggressively because we have a strong niche and we've seen growth every week and every month for the past 4 years. But the reason is that the CPM that we're able to get for that, for ID, is still quite low. And because of the way that the marketplace works domestically and internationally, it takes a few years before you can earn up the full value of your CPM. And so we started ID, when we flipped it from Discovery Times, it was probably getting 1/3 of the CPM that a successful cable network gets. And so little by little, we've been pushing it. And we've had some success, but a lot of the upside over the next 2 to 3 years -- I mean, right now the kind of ratings that we're delivering in daytime in women is just very valuable and the spread between what other cable networks are getting and what we're getting is really very, very significant. And so that'll take a couple of years. We also think we'll get the growth of that. And in terms of the amount of growth that it's provided for us in the last few years, it's small. In fact, there's been margin compression over the last few years because we've been investing in ID. And so the next 2, 3 and 4 years is when you're going to see the big benefit of that because we have successful series that are returning, but more importantly, the CPM is growing and it continues to grow every month and we're going to be patient with it. But that's going to be a sustainable grower for us. But behind that, we do have a number of networks that are continuing to grow. We have Science Channel that's growing very effectively for us. Animal Planet was the #30 or 32 network in America for men. It's broken now; it's now the #18 network for men in September. And so we're seeing a lot of growth because we're believers in investing in our content and the creative teams that we have here at the company. And if you take a look at where we are, we've said that we're trying -- over the last several years we're going to drive Discovery. We felt we were the best platform media company in the world, but what we really needed to do is build the right creative culture. And we think we're well on our way to doing that. And our strategy was to lay low in the Olympics and then come out strong with our creative content and build from there. We were strong out of the Olympics. We had a great September. And October was the best October Discovery has ever had. We were up 17% across the board in an industry, a cable industry, that was down a few percentage points and broadcast down. And so I think we're going to continue to push on that. But if we can continue to grow our market share like that over the next several months, in 1 year or 2 ahead, you're going to see very big sustainable growth, particularly as we take a lot of that content around the world. So Andy, on the...\nAndrew C. Warren\nYes, David, regarding your question of the one-time item a year ago, in the fourth quarter we announced or disclosed that we had about $5 million one-time pickup from ADU [ph] recognition kind of in the fourth quarter. That's non-recurring on the fourth quarter this year.\nOperator\nYour next question we have comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nI have one for each of you. David, could you just give us your thought process on M&A in general? And along the lines of what you've discussed on this call, on the free-to-air, how do you think about the free-to-air acquisitions versus pay-tv when you think about stuff outside the U.S.?\nDavid M. Zaslav\nOkay. Well, we've been very careful because we're looking -- we only want to buy assets if we think they can help us grow faster because we have so much sustainable growth we think in the 13 channels we have here in the U.S. and maybe more importantly, in terms of our strategy, our international advantage. But the key to our company is dual revenue stream. That's the key to our domestic and international business. The reason why we're so profitable with free-to-air is because we have 8, 10, 11 dual revenue stream channels in a lot of these markets that we've been in for 5 or 10 years and we have a ton of content that's all paid for in those markets. And so free-to-air is really a very different model than when you think about free-to-air. We're not buying a free-to-air channel and then creating original content and buying content. So for us, free-to-air there is sort of an accessory, and I think long term it will stay that way. And free-to-air is not the core of how we see ourselves as a company. So -- and as we look at M&A, I would say -- as I've said over the last few years, our #1 target is international. We've grown our International business from 2007, we were making $250 million. This year, we'll make significantly more than $700 million. Our margins are expanding. The subscribers are growing. We're well positioned. But most importantly, we've got great teams on the ground in most markets now selling for us, and I'm spending over 40% of my time outside the U.S. because I think that's a lot of where the future and the differentiator of our company is. So to the extent that we could find assets outside the U.S. that'll help us grow faster, that we can evaluate quickly, that we have real synergy with, that would be our first priority. Having said that, we haven't been -- we don't want to overpay and we haven't been able to find those assets yet, but we're hopeful.\nJessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nAnd then the second question is, actually I just want to follow up on a comment that Andy made earlier about advertising. You said something about volume being softer. On the other hand, it sounds like given your ratings, your upfront performance, you guys are doing okay. I just wanted you to clarify what you meant by that.\nAndrew C. Warren\nYes, Jessica, we've had a few weeks of softness in early October. It's stronger now and the volume has picked up. But there were a couple of weeks in the early parts of October that were a little soft.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.\nDouglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nA couple of questions. One for David or one topic for David. I think you're probably starting to get deeper in the negotiations with distributors on renewals. I think you've noted about 20% distribution up at year-end 2012. So I'd be interested in any characterization you would share of how those negotiations -- discussions are going. I mean, do they understand the value that Discovery has created since the renewals? Are they looking at value the same way you're looking at value? Anything you could share would be helpful.\nDavid M. Zaslav\nOkay, great. We have a little bit less than 20% of our deals coming up and they come up over the next 5 years. But we feel very good about where we are. Our ratings across the board on our channels have never been this strong. Discovery is very solid. TLC has broken out. We have Animal Planet, strong. Maybe more importantly, as you look at all the additional channels we have, we have Discovery Espa\u00f1ol, the #1 channel to the Hispanic audience for men. We have Science with a great affinity audience. We have Velocity with an affinity male audience, so we have ID with middle-aged and older women. So we have a great diversity. We have great affinity groups. But more importantly, it's a far cry from where we were when we did our deals, where we had a strong Discovery, when TLC was the #20 or 25 network in America and then we had 11 more channels. And so all of our channels come up at once. Our market share was about 4%. Now it's over 9% and growing. And we have a great equitable argument, where we have reduced the overall cost of how we spend our money everywhere but content and brand. And we're spending a lot more money on our channels. And it's delivering for the operators. And so we feel that this is a good moment for us. It's been our strategy to make our channel stronger than grow our market share. And I think it's happening at a very good time. And we expect that it will be recognized with meaningful value from the distributors because they're meaningful value from us.\nDouglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nAnd I know I'm sort of chasing the question that you're not in a position that you necessarily want to answer for investors at this point in time. But I mean, can you point us to the right direction as to how we should think about value? If we use your ratings, as you said, your market share has more than doubled, but I imagine the expectation isn't that you're going to double your rates. I mean, is there I think you can point us to that we can use for the math behind what we should think the rate increases would be?\nDavid M. Zaslav\nWe don't like to talk about negotiations. What I would say is that we think that we should be getting significantly more value from the operators for our channels. That value will come primarily in terms of increased sub fees. But there are other ways that the distributors can give us value, either with -- for instance ID was in 48 million homes 4 years ago; today it's in 80 million homes, Science was in 45 million homes; today it's in 72 million homes. So more carriage for our channels as well. But we're in some of those negotiations. We're looking forward to them. In addition, there are a number of operators that are interested in TV Everywhere. We haven't done TV Everywhere deals with anybody. The good news for us is we own all of our content. We created a new window for Netflix, which is working quite well for us, primarily 1.5 years to 2 years and older. The TV Everywhere window is tighter than that. And that, if we do reach deals, that will provide additional value and that could potentially accelerate when we do our deals. And one of the things that you see in the performance of the company is a little lumpiness in the way that the Netflix deal comes through. It's a very favorable deal for us. That deal -- we haven't seen any degradation in audience. In fact, for some of the series that we've provided that are much older, we're seeing some lift. And as you know, we have a right next year in the beginning of the year to opt in to another year of the Netflix deal on very attractive terms, which if we elect would then be again lumpy with a very big lump next year for that additional year that we opt in to.\nAndrew C. Warren\nJust to add one comment to David's notion on Netflix. While that not only gives us great opportunity to monetize some of our library, it is very lumpy from a P&L perspective. But from a cash flow perspective, it's extraordinary. And those cash flows are more steady throughout the period of time. So it allows us to really maximize the value of our cash flow. And if you look at the third quarter, our free cash flow was up 12%. That's very much driven by that. And so the cash flows of Netflix really is -- and Amazon, both really have a great cash profile.\nOperator\nThe next question we have comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nI just had a clarification question for Andy and then a bigger picture one for David. Andy, just on the programming cost for next year, can you just repeat what you said? I just -- I think I missed it. I know you said it was up 15% next year?\nAndrew C. Warren\nNo, Ben, what we said was programming expense to be up $50 million to $60 million next year as we amortize the increased investment we made this year. So as I've said, I think on this call and prior calls, we have invested in content this year, obviously getting a great payback on that, given our international growth and given the ratings we're seeing across our platforms. But we will have an amort pickup next year as we expense the cash we spent this year. But very importantly, we expect next year's cash spend to be reduced significantly from this year. A lot of that is driven by the fact we've increased the number of original hours on our core programs, so therefore, we don't have as much of that next year year-over-year, so we should have a much more levelized [ph] low level of cash increase on CapEx.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nOkay. And I don't know if you have it in front of you, but do you have what the content expense and cash growth will be in '12, so we have the base?\nAndrew C. Warren\nWell, it's double digit on both. And so the expectation is double-digit increase on amort next year, but low-single digit on cash next year.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nGot it. Okay. And then, David, one of the things that everyone's focused on beyond the macro is just what's happening with ratings trend. And I was wondering if you could chime in on that. It's obviously focused on the broadcasters. But is it something that you think is benefiting your business currently in the fourth quarter? And do you see the ratings erosion as a sign of a measurement issue or maybe something larger that is impacting the business? We'd love to get your thoughts.\nDavid M. Zaslav\nIt's hard to tell. I think that our strategy clearly is different. We have invested significantly in about 7 channels. Primarily 6.5 years ago, when I got here, this company was primarily Discovery. And so we've invested in TLC, which is now a top 5 network for women. We've invested in Animal Planet. We've invested in ID, a top 10 network in America. We've invested in Velocity, Destination America, OWN. So we're believers. We believe that viewers are not -- that if our strategy was just to make sure that we held or would grow 1 network or 2 networks, that, that -- that a better bet is to try and grow those 2 networks, but also invest in a number of other brands that people get comfortable with and spend time with. And it's been working for us domestically and internationally. I think it helps that as you look at the way people watch television, on Friday night, we're the #1 network for women on TLC, we're the #1 network for women on Sunday nights, that often when you ask women what shows they watch, they can name one show. But they know that TLC gets them and that's the place to go. The same thing for Discovery on several nights. People love ID and they can't name the shows, but they just want to hang out there. And so I think that the fact that people are spending more time with brands on television, and as you see broadcast coming down, we're seeing real growth. And so we believe that, that's probably going to continue. I can't speak to what's going to happen to broadcast, but we certainly see a trend that our brands are growing. And a better job we do with the characters and the stories and understanding who our audience is on each of these channels, we're able to grow. I mean, 17% growth in October is really significant, but if you look at the last 3 years, our market share has grown virtually -- has grown literally every quarter over the last 3 years, and we're starting to accelerate now. We did have a soft patch, which we talked about, at Discovery and TLC, which it showed itself in this quarter. In July, TLC and Discovery were soft, and we made a very determined strategy that we were not going to use our best content during the Olympics, particularly after the first day or 2 where the Olympics came out strong. So we -- domestically and internationally, we said we would stand down. But our strategy was as soon as the Olympics ended, we were going to come back strong and we believed because the audience was disenfranchised in terms of what they watch and how they watch it for 3 weeks, because everyone was watching the Olympics, that we would be able to pick up market share. And it has really worked for us and it's accelerating. And so we're going to continue with that strategy because I think that's how we're going to grow domestically and around the world.\nOperator\nThe next question we have comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nOne quick one on OWN again. I just wondered if you could maybe reconcile for us or help us understand. The ratings are just so high. I guess I'm somewhat surprised to see the increase in the loss line of the Other. I don't know if there's other stuff in there or something about the timing. But just given how strong the ratings are, that big sequential increase in the loss, anything you could help us with what's going on there would be number one. And then second, just a quick one. On the tax stuff, Andy, we knew you're working on that. I guess some of us forgot that sometimes to make progress you've got to take a step backwards. Do you have an idea, just -- I'm not asking for a long term forecast, but just how big if you could bound sort of the magnitude of where you think the tax rate could come down to you over the long term, just some indication of how the size of an opportunity you think that is?\nAndrew C. Warren\nSure. Todd, on the first question regarding OWN, the losses were higher but they were noncash losses. The first part of the loss we knew about. We talked it in the last call about higher marketing and we're getting a payback, now if you look at the 60% increase in ratings. The second part there, the losses that flowed through Other income line, were content write-offs at OWN. As the new content is performing so well, we're just writing off some old library products. And so that's flowing through that. But again it's important to note that's noncash. The real key emphasis on OWN right now is the progress we're making on the funding piece. In the first half of OWN, we funded $84 million; in the third quarter, only $29 million; and in the fourth quarter we look for less than that. So we're clearly in line with our 2012 funding being less than '11. And so the progress we're making there both from an operating and ratings perspective is tremendous. But really from a cash flow perspective we're really right on, if not better than, what we highlighted 6 months ago.\nDavid M. Zaslav\nAnd when you think about OWN, not only is the overall performance, economic performance, stronger, but the ratings are stronger and there is this moment where you're fighting to get people -- people only watch 6 or 8 channels, you're fighting to get people to spend time with your channel. And OWN has begun to really find a rhythm. The length of view is the second highest in our portfolio, so when people find it, they hang with it and they like it. Oprah has been very -- working very hard. She's on the air much more often. But more importantly, we're getting a lot of our rating points right now from Ilanya and from Sweetie Pie's and from a lot of the other original hours that we have on OWN. And we're -- our hit rate is dramatically higher. We were trying to figure out what OWN is and with a lot of time by the leadership there, Sheri Salata and Erik Logan and Oprah herself, and talking to the audience through oprah.com. We have a good sense of what they want. Now we're giving it to them. And so let's get the stuff out that's wrong. Let's do more of what's right. And then when you add to that, as a topping, Tyler Perry, maybe one of the great talents in Hollywood because he writes, he produces, he stars in. We went down to visit his facility in Atlanta. He does it all himself. We writes it all himself and he has a great relationship with Oprah. This is something that Oprah really wanted. We really wanted it. Tyler wanted it. I think it's going to create more balance, more humor, more diversity on the network. And if you think about it, Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey together on OWN. And so we're feeling quite good about that and next year will be a good year.\nAndrew C. Warren\nAnd, Todd, regarding your tax comment. It's well said. You often take a step back to move forward on tax. We did transfer intangible assets from the U.S. to the U.K. Those transfers had some temporary increases in the effective tax rate based on how we recognized that transfer, if there's a gain associated with that. But long term the effective tax rate goes down from that and there's other things we're pursuing as well given our global structures. So what I can say is this: today we're about a 36% effective tax rate both cash and effective. My goal is really to get that down 700 basis points and the goal being kind of the low 30s.\nOperator\nThe next question we have comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from Nomura.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division\nI have one housekeeping for Andy and then one for David, thematically. Andy, if you could just give us a help on the adjustments you made for your outlook. How big was Creative Sound Services in terms of the change and how big was the mark-to-market in terms of your updates? So when you guys adjusted your view for net income this year, can you help us with those moving pieces?\nAndrew C. Warren\nSure. Well, the Creative Sound Services was about $75 million of revenue and so that's fully eliminated. The mark-to-market is about $20 million given the increase in our stock price. And so those are kind of the 2 higher. And then tax, the tax is slightly higher based on the adjustments I just talked about. The transfer of some of the intangibles creates a short-term effective tax rate increase.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division\nBecause I certainly know the revenues, and we assume like mid -- your double-digit margin is basically 15%, 20% for your sound solutions -- sorry, Sound Services?\nAndrew C. Warren\nOh, no. That was basically a profit-neutral business.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division\nOkay. So that doesn't really hit net income? Okay. And then, David, a question for you. You guys have been so successful in investment in programming. Look at the growth you have globally in ratings. Why would you want to slow down cash spending next year? Why not keep going at the level you've spent. And is there a chance that you'll revisit that if things change for programming next year?\nDavid M. Zaslav\nYes, first, we've been finding a lot of success, Michael with -- we have 3 series on TLC that are getting almost a 3 rating, some of -- 2 of them getting actually over a 3 rating. We have a lot of returning series. And for us unlike a lot of the other models, when we get returning series, the additional cost on return is not that high. And we won't have to go out and look for a lot more content on a number of these brands because we have a lot more returning, and so that's pretty efficient. And we're not going to be reducing. We just -- the increase is going to be -- we're not going to  need to increase in a meaningful way. If we feel that we do because there's a big opportunity, we will. But we're getting -- we're much more efficient. We've also worked very hard over the last several years to get really good creative teams in place. We've made lots of mistakes. We've learned from those mistakes. And so -- and we have a really good sense of the brands at this point, probably much better than we ever have. It's still a hit or miss business, but we're feeling much better about where we are. And with more returning, we have much more confidence in the sustainability. When you look at Discovery, 4 years ago, it was Dirty Jobs, it was Man vs. Wild and it was MythBusters. Today, we have 5 series now that -- some of those are gone, and we have 5 series that are bigger than all 3 of those put together. Gold Rush is bigger than 3 of those series all put together. And so our series are fresher. And that's true across the board with ID. Henry's got a great formula. So we just think we could be more efficient and effective and less waste.\nOperator\nThe next question we have comes from the line of Richard Greenfield from BTIG.\nRichard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division\nA couple of questions. One, when you look at Hub, curious how your agreement with Hasbro works. If Hasbro was in any event acquired by a third party, how does that impact The Hub and in its access to content and characters related to Hasbro? And then just two, David, you spoke about your excitement surrounding Tyler Perry and what that's going to do to OWN ratings. Just curious in terms of -- it seems like there's a change relative to kind of the original kind of lead-your-best-life aspirational side. And I was wondering as you look at OWN and how you're positioning it with advertisers, is this now going to be more of a general entertainment network, like a TBS where this programming has been before. Just wondering kind of how you're going to position it from an ad rate and sub rate card perspective.\nDavid M. Zaslav\nOkay. The Hub is doing great, by the way. It's up over 60% in the last quarter, and Margaret Loesch is doing a terrific job. Quickly, we have great optionality if the company was to be acquired. We have kind of one-way optionality in terms into what we do, which gives us some good flexibility. But the business is doing very well, and we're happy with it. On Tyler Perry, it's really consistent with their vision. If anything, we were much too teachy [ph] and preachy and earnest when we started. And the mission for Oprah and I now is that we have a lot of great stuff like Super Soul Sunday and Life Class and Master Class. But we also -- we're having a lot of fun with Sweetie Pie's and with Tyler's type of stuff and with lot of content that's on there. And the audience said to us, \"We want to have fun, we want to laugh, we want to see families. We want to see families struggle and we want to see families have fun. And we want some comedy.\" And so Tyler I think fits squarely within. And we're also getting a very large African-American audience on OWN, dramatic African-American audience. There was -- when Oprah interviewed Rihanna, we had more African-American women watching OWN than ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX put together. And so Tyler appeals to everyone, but that appeal to the African-American audience will be another helper.\nOperator\nThe next question we have comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.\nAnthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division\nI just have one quick one left for Andy, which is, did you guys -- and I'm sorry if you did this -- did you update your 2012 free cash flow guidance number, Andy? And then as you look into 2013, I guess, is there anything changing as you -- as I compare net income to free cash flow in the model, is there anything that would sort of change that general ratio in terms of working capital or cash versus noncash as we look into 2013? Just trying to get free cash flow in the model accurate.\nAndrew C. Warren\nOkay. We did not actually update the free cash flow, Anthony. But it's still looking at about $1 billion for 2012. With regard to '13, we'll provide more perspective on '13 on the year-end call. But the only thing I'll highlight as far as a different thought as you model year-over-year, think in terms of less, well, a slight increase in content spend, certainly less of an increase than we had in 2012. So it will be slightly up but up a whole lot less than we had this year. But again, we'll provide much more perspective and granularity on that on the year-end call.\nOperator\nThe next question we have comes from Alexia Quadrani's line from JPMorgan.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nI'm just following up on your comments really about the advertising market. I think you mentioned it slowed a bit in early October and then strengthened a bit. I guess, sort of just going back, would you say that the fourth quarter advertising market, the health of it scatter-over-scatter is still a little bit stronger than it was in Q3 or not necessarily given the slow start?\nDavid M. Zaslav\nYes, the domestic advertising market, it feels quite strong now. There was a period for about 2 weeks where the volume, the pricing was there, but the volume wasn't there. We did hold price. But the volume has come back and the price is still more than double-digit over high double-digit over upfront. And so we're feeling good about that domestically. Internationally this quarter, we had 10% ad growth, which for us was a drop. But we have good visibility into next quarter. And we expect that it will be mid-teen -- well in the mid-teens or better. The market feels quite strong for us. As you look at last quarter, we faced a couple of issues. One was the Olympics. We clearly made the strategy that we weren't going to do original programming domestically or around the world, and so that hurt us. It hurt us I think in a good way because we've come back strong, but there's no question that those 3 weeks did have an impact. And the fact that the Olympics went across most of Europe in real time probably had more of an impact than maybe something like Brazil will have, which was a different time zone and the Winter Olympics is always much smaller. In addition, interestingly, we found strength in most markets with the exception of Asia. So really what it was, was the Olympics in Asia. And Asia was 2 or 3 campaigns that moved out of the third quarter. And so we saw a significant movement. Asia now looks good, and we feel good about next quarter, when we expect that we'll be returning to mid-teens or better. And you'll see the growth trajectory continue as you would expect.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nAnd I would assume foreign exchange is probably a bit less of a hit in the fourth quarter, is that fair?\nAndrew C. Warren\nWell, that's only an expectation. Right now, we don't have a preview on where rates are going. FX has been a real bad guy for us this year. I mean, a multi-tens of millions of impact on OIBDA. And we have so many different moving currencies that affect us. So today, that's been certainly negative impact, but right now we're not looking at or forecasting any big change between now and year end.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Michael Morris from Davenport & Company.\nMichael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division\nI'll try to be quick here. One on International, one on Oprah. Your subscriber base growth was 17% internationally but your affiliates and ads are both below that, I assume because you're growing more in lower-priced markets. What's the outlook for that turning into a tailwind at some point? Is it simply a question of the health of the macro economy in those markets or is that something that you can see, say, within the next year or 2, where you're growing faster than the subscriber growth? And then I have one quick follow-up.\nDavid M. Zaslav\nYes, Michael, that is what we're seeing, so for instance, Brazil and Mexico are growing aggressively, but they're going after the C Class. And so where we might have in Brazil, we have 11 channels. And we have 5 of the top 20 channels in Brazil. And all of those channels were carried, but we made the decision that in order to kind of opt in to the C Class, where they're only offering 25 channels, that we would allow for 4 or 5 of our channels to be carried out of 20 or 25 or 30 rather than trying to push 11, because we didn't think we'd get them all in. Others have decided not to participate and we think that was a mistake because we're seeding our brands all around the world and we're putting our best brands forward in those smaller tiers. And what's happening is not so much in Brazil, but more in Mexico and more in Russia, that those little by little, there's a kind of a grow-up where you start with your 30 channels and then they're trying to get you to come up to the 50 or the 60. And so we'll get the advantage of that. And we'll also continue to get the advantage of the growth, but a lot of the growth is in C Class in some of these emerging markets. And so we may be getting less, but the growth is really substantial and it's important that we're a part of it and it builds our relationship with the distributors in all those markets because we have actually more market share among the C Class because of the strategy of pushing down into it.\nMichael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division\nGreat, that's helpful. And over on OWN, I know you guys have targeted breakeven next year. When you look at the difference between now and then and what's going to drive that, can you give a little insight on how much is coming from, let's say, distribution growth versus ad growth versus cost control as you get from where you are now to getting to that breakeven point?\nAndrew C. Warren\nWell, Michael, I mean clearly the business is performing at or better than we had hoped it would and when we provided that perspective 6 months ago, we're right in line with again if not better than we had thought. But we're not going to really get into 2013 right now. Just to clarify, we really talked about a breakeven in the second half of '13. And we'll update some of that perspective and guidance on the year-end call. But the business is clearly performing and performing at or better than we had hoped.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of with Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna Financial Gr.\nVasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division\nIt's Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna. Andy, what should we expect in terms of pace of buyback. Will it change depending on the stock price? Some of your peers made comments recently that it does impact them. And then, David, you mentioned when you were discussing how you re-purposed a lot of successful networks that you made some mistakes. A little bit -- just curious to hear some of those lessons learned over the past several years?\nAndrew C. Warren\nSure. Well, Vasily, on the stock repurchase, like what you saw, we did over $450 million in the third quarter. Now as we look at how we allocate capital, first and foremost is to drive organic growth. Secondly, it's about finding perhaps the right acquisition and the right allocation of capital preferably internationally. And then thirdly, if we maximize the first 2, we'll continue to look at returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase program. So look, I've had a bullish view on this. I use free cash flow per share as the model we use internally to determine kind of the IRR. And to date, that's been a good return for us and we continue to be an active buyer of our stock. If you look at the -- in the October timeframe, we had a predetermined grid going into October because that's a close window for us. And as the stock performed nicely and went up, we're buying fewer shares as you would expect from a grid like that. But look, for us it's all about forward-looking free cash flow per share and buying off that to expectation, with again that being the third allocation of capital relative to organic growth and acquisitions.\nDavid M. Zaslav\nI think some of the best things that we've done at Discovery is create a culture where you raise your hand and you say that what you felt was your best idea is not the best idea. Ultimately, the best idea's what audience likes and what nourishes them in our business. So when I got here, TLC was the #23 or 24 in American. And we hired a whole team to go out to LA, and it was my strategy that if we made TLC sexier and cooler and hipper that we'd go from the #24 channel to a top 10 channel. We did that, and 6 months later, TLC was the #30 or 32 network in America. We lost 1/3 of our audience and the people that loved TLC left. And we took a hard look at what the TLC brand was and what we did wrong, and it led us to a great recipe. What we did wrong was that TLC is about middle America, it's about real values, it's about heart, it's about great storytelling, about families that live a life that's different than the way they live in New York and LA. And I had to go back to the board and say, I made a mistake. This isn't the right team. We got to make a change. We hired Eileen O'Neill. We drilled down for another 3 months on what the brand was. And we found a very unique strategy in TLC, which is forget New York and LA. TLC is about middle America and it's about heart. And here we are now. We had one point last month where 3 nights a week we were the #1 cable network in America for women with Honey Boo Boo, with wedding programming on Friday and on Sunday night with Long Island Medium and Breaking Amish. Sunday night's still the most competitive night on TV. We're averaging over a 3. So that was one. Two was Planet Green, which I really thought that I looked at FOX News, I looked at the fact that it was a new idea of having an affinity group that was built-in, that was had a certain way of looking at the world and that we could do the same thing by creating a channel called Planet Green that was about the environment. And we spent a fair amount of money and we had to raise our hand and say it's not working. And so we shut it down and we relaunched it as Destination America and we spoke to the audience about what they want, we spoke to advertisers and distributors and we came up with Destination America and it's up dramatically and we're making more money. And so that's the way the culture works here. And I think we've gotten better at it. It even works on a micro basis. We waste a lot of money by continuing to do shows that we think are good ideas but halfway through we figure out are not so good. But we continue to do them. And so we now have a creative culture that's more about raising their hands and say, \"Let's shoot this, it isn't going to work and let's do something that the audience is going to like better.\"\nCraig Felenstein\nThank you, everyone, for joining us.

Good afternoon, everyone, again. We'd like to welcome Carrier here to the 8th Annual Credit Suisse Industrial Conference. Joining me today is David Gitlin, Carrier\u2019s CEO; Patrick Goris, Carrier\u2019s CFO; and Sam Pearlstein of Investor Relations. \nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nQ - John Walsh\nI think what we're actually going to do is head straight into the fireside chat. So, maybe with that, David, kind of the first question for you. You spun out of UTX really in the heart of COVID. You've been navigating it quite well the last couple of quarters. How has that, either accelerated some of the strategy you laid out for us earlier in the year or kind of shifted priorities and pushed anything potentially to the right?\nDavid Gitlin\nWell, good afternoon, John. Thanks for having us.\nWhen we look back at 2020, what I would tell you is, the pandemic has really accelerated all the strategies we laid out, as we were going, preparing to go public. On the cost side, we said we were going to be aggressive. It's really forced us to even be more aggressive. So, we had started at Carrier 600, of course, now it\u2019s Carrier 700. Very effective there. We had talked about transforming G&A in a profound way, and we've gotten great traction there, really laid a foundation for next year when we're going to really initiate a process to reduce G&A in a significant way and really simplify the business, the number of JVs, number of suppliers, number of legal entities.\nWe've also shined a light on growth. And really what the pandemic did is help us crystallize our focus on the two ecosystems that we're very focused on, healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions. And we've also leaned into our three pillars of growth. We've had good share gains, which is our first pillar, really expansion into some new geographic areas, not the China's new, but we really wanted to lean into that. And I'm very proud of the China performance. And really pivot to services and digital. And we've seen great progress there.\nAnd then, the last point I'd make John is on the culture side, which is very significant. The pandemic has brought out the best in our team at all levels. We've initiated the Carrier Way with the focus on agility, innovation. We were proud to receive one of the recognitions from Time Magazine as Top Innovation of the Year with our OptiClean unit. A focus on customers and outside in performance culture. We have a no excuse to drive results culture. And we just issued our ESG targets a few days ago really with a focus on sustainability and playing our role in climate change. So, I think what we really done in 2020 is really lay us very strong foundation, really good cash performance, and that's really positioned as well, as we look ahead into '21.\nJohn Walsh\nGreat. Thank you for those -- the good answer there. I guess, long time, no see, Patrick. Now you're here at Carrier. Maybe a question for you, kind of what were some of the things that attracted you the opportunity at Carrier?\nPatrick Goris\nJohn, thank you for having us. So, it's been above two weeks now, and of course, very excited to be here. Frankly, it's a unique opportunity to join a 100-year old startup company. It's an attractive industry, attractive market position and frankly with tremendous potential. And, only been here for a couple of weeks, but obviously I sense a very strong focus on accelerating profitable growth, driving efficiencies, continuous improvements, free cash flow focus, and obviously, it\u2019s going to be my role to enhance that focus and drive execution. And so, we can continue to deliver long-term superior financial performance for our share-owners.\nJohn Walsh\nGreat. Maybe first kind of starting near-term before we talk about some of the big drivers in the industry. But, we often get asked a lot of questions around the Q4 guide. I guess, what you\u2019re guiding to from a profit level does seem to break a little bit from kind of the normal seasonality. So, I guess, is there something happening in the fourth quarter this year that's driving the levels of profitability you're guiding to we're still kind of in the midst of the pandemic. So, there's a little bit of conservatism built in there? How should we think about that in Q4 as well?\nPatrick Goris\nLet me provide you some of the moving pieces for the fourth quarter. Maybe before I do that, just to say, we still expect the full year to come in line with what we provided back in October. It's about $17.3 billion in sales, about $2.2 billion in adjusted profits, perhaps 30, 50 millionish better than that, and about $1.5 billion of free cash flow. So, as you\u2019ve pointed out, John, for the fourth quarter, this implies our sales to be down a little bit year-over-year, but our operating earnings to be down a little over a $100 million.\nSo, what are the moving pieces? One, we see a tailwind from Carrier 700. As we said before, we expect to deliver about 250 or so million of savings there this year. The Q4 impact of that headwind is offset by a few items. One, I mentioned that our sales will be down a little bit in the fourth quarter, expect also lower JV income in the fourth quarter. Another headwind there is $75 million of investments that we expect to hit in the fourth quarter. You've heard us say that for the full year \u201820, we intend to reinvest $100 million in the business. It's very much backend loaded, about $75 million of that is in the fourth quarter. And then, finally, I'd say, there are about $25 million of additional public company costs and about $30 million of one-time items that impact us this Q4 versus the last year. So, several moving pieces here. But, that kind of explains about a $100 million or a little bit more operating earnings decrease year-over-year on flattish sales.\nA lot of it is timing of the investments, and of course, the total Company costs and some of the one-time items that I was referring to.\nDavid Gitlin\nAnd John, if I may, just to add to what Patrick said is that, if you turn the clock back, we had come into the year saying that we would invest an incremental $150 million, and then we reduced it to a $100 million. And we really loosened those ranges as we got kind of into late 2Q, really into 3Q. And clearly, we could drop through more even in the fourth quarter if it weren't for the investments. That's a very purposeful conscious decision that we're making as we really pivot to growth and focus on setting ourselves up for '21 and '22 to have the kind of growth expectations that we have for ourselves and that investors have for us. So, it's a very deliberate move by us to really make sure that we're playing offense, and we're investing for our future. And that's what we're doing here in the fourth quarter.\nJohn Walsh\nMaybe a follow-up to that. As we think about these investments, I think you called out $300 million. Kind of what happens when we get there? I think that's a cumulative number. So first, maybe clarification on that. And then, do we step back down, once you've made these reinvestments? Do we get them going higher? Do we plateau? How do we think about that longer term?\nPatrick Goris\nYes. So, John, what we said is $300 million would be our plan to reinvest in the business over a period of three years. We still believe that's a good number. As Dave just mentioned, we had targeted about $150 million for fiscal '20. Given COVID, we've reduced that to about $100 million. Our expectation for fiscal '21 is about that $100 million of incremental investment '21 versus '20. And of course, we'll wait till February when we provide formal guidance, but that's the placeholder you can use for now. And frankly, even after we've reinvested the $300 million, if we find additional high-return investments beyond the $300 million, then we will obviously consider pursuing that. But, this is a framework we have at this time for this year and for the next couple of years.\nJohn Walsh\nGreat. So, maybe just attacking that question another way. Last quarter, you did talk a little bit about 2021 where you articulated some of these temporary costs coming back, you talked about the investments, right, you gave some view of where you think incrementals will be. The question then also becomes that same formulas we think about beyond '21, are there visibility and any detractors from that Carrier 700 dropping through to the bottom line that you would have now? Because I would assume that the formulas, we just removed the temporary costs, maybe you've plateaued investments, and we're really talking about a lot more of that Carrier 700 dropping through, is that right?\nPatrick Goris\nYes. Let me provide the color for fiscal '21. And so, for fiscal '21, what we said is, we would invest $100 million in our business, and the overall framework for fiscal '21 is also we were targeting about 30% incrementals or close to 30% incrementals for fiscal '21. In essence, that's the drop through from our sales. You've heard us take Carrier 700 now expected to yield about $200 million to $250 million in savings next year. We expect to reinvest about $100 million of that. For fiscal '21, we have an unusual headwind from the reinstatement of those cost actions that we had in fiscal '20. So, for fiscal '21, we don't expect the fall through of the Carrier 700 benefits. That would change of course -- or could change of course in fiscal '22 because there would no longer be this headwind from the cost actions we took, related to COVID.\nAnd so, for the framework you can think of, fiscal '21, think of the Carrier 700 benefits being offset by reinvestments and the headwinds of the temporary actions we took in fiscal '20. After that, of course, we would expect more of the Carrier 700 savings to fall through to the bottom line.\nJohn Walsh\nOkay. I'd love to shift the conversation now to indoor air quality. So, one, thank you for taking a stab at trying to size what the opportunity is there. I think, we've heard a couple of other companies also try to size that opportunity. Can you put a little bit more behind the 9 to $10 billion you talked about? Is that just indoor air quality? Is there some green stimulus that leaks into that number? How do we get comfortable with that 9 to $10 billion, in the right ballpark?\nDavid Gitlin\nJohn, we looked at the markets that we participate in and focused on the commercial markets, and we looked at that as a 90 to $100 billion overall market. And then, we looked at what the incremental sales that we've been realizing associated with healthy buildings. And a lot of that is IAQ, but it includes some other things that we have, including parts of our Fire & Security portfolio, where we've been selling thermal scanning, contact tracing, other elements there. So, we looked at kind of a healthy building incremental to it. And we've been -- our experience has generally been around 10% of incremental sales. We've had chiller sales, where on top of what we would have traditionally sold, we sold bipolar ionization or we sold different filtration systems on top of that. We also looked at introductions of new products, like our OptiClean and other new products that we've been coming forward with. And what we've traditionally seen is this 10% incremental. And that's how we got to the 9 to $10 billion.\nI don't want to pretend there was more science behind it than that. I mean, that\u2019s -- it's our best sense of what that market opportunity looks like. What we're really trying to do is, get into the trenches to drive those sales. So, on the last quarter, we talked about a pipeline of $150 million that we had line of sight to. We had realized about a third of that, and we were developing confidence around the remaining 100 of it. That pipeline now is $165 million. And the pipeline is not a pipe dream. It's real conversations with real customers. So, after only about eight months at this, we have a pipeline of about $165 million. We see real wins every week. We had one in China, just a week or so ago, where we were providing advanced airside products to Guangzhou Respiratory Center that included UV lights. \nSo, I mean, it's a very global phenomenon. It obviously applies to the verticals where you see the most densities, so education, commercial buildings that are going to start welcoming folks back. Retail is going to be critical, restaurants, hospitality, hotels.\nSo, we're confident that it's going to be part of the new normal. I think of it, John, a little bit like after 9/11 that, there were some fundamental shifts in security systems. It became the new normal for venues like sporting events or airports and other places. Security that wasn't there before became a new normal. And I think focus on indoor air quality and healthy buildings will be the new normal. And I think we're well positioned there.\nJohn Walsh\nGot you. And I think in your opening remarks or in answer to that kind of first question of mine, you talked about reducing the complexity, right, the JV structure. But, I think also, early on, you talked about kind of taking a dispassionate view around the portfolio. Where are we in that? And kind of, when should we expect any kind of further update to that?\nDavid Gitlin\nThat's an ongoing process. You talk about the JV piece of that. We started with 58 JVs, 40 of which were minority, unconsolidated JVs. We've looked at all 58 of them. There's some that fit into the category, there's probably 5 to 10 that fit into a category that they're very small, very subscale, and we have to ask ourselves, does the potential benefit justify the amount of management distraction that goes into supporting those. And I think there's going to be -- if you look at that category, there's going to be some that we exit. Then, there's some that we look at and say, we really liked the relationship, we like the space that we're in, but we would prefer to be in a consolidating position. And those are discussions that don't happen overnight. And we continue to kind of work our way through those discussions with partners. Some we're very pleased with. We have a great partnership, for example, with Watsco, with distribution here in the United States for our resi business. And Al and his team have been very supportive for our growth initiatives. So, we're pleased with that. And then, there are some where we always look at is there -- should we -- do we have the opportunity to unlock value, really hidden value that we continue to assess on a recurring basis.\nAnd then, the rest of the portfolio, what I can tell you is that we said that we would take a very dispassionate look at it, and we continue to do that. And the question is, for that all parts of our portfolio is, are they worth more to us than they would be in the hands of someone else? And then, if we decide that you could create more value by divesting a part of the portfolio, what's the right timing to do that? So, those assessments are ongoing. And then, the flip side of that is that because our cash generation has been strong, are there bolt-ons we want to add? So, we continue to look for acquisitions that are of the right size that are strategic.\nJohn Walsh\nGot you. I guess maybe thinking back along the lines of the investments, obviously, there has been a lot of new product introduction. You put out several press releases. But, are those -- is that $300 million also funding investments to make the sales force be able to sell digital and other solutions as buildings become more complex, or is that purely a product numbers we should think about it?\nDavid Gitlin\nYes. When we crafted it, we originally -- and we still do, we really think about it in three categories. There's R&D, there's salespeople, and there's digital. So, we have been adding more R&D, and you'll see that as we get into next year or two, Patrick talked about an incremental $100 million of investments that we have a lot of opportunities on the R&D side. We just introduced in Europe, for example, low GWP scroll air-cooled compressor that's for our chiller portfolio that\u2019s been very well received, after a very short period of time. So, we see a lot of demand on the R&D side. We introduced about 100 new products this year. I think, this year is going to be about 125 new products. So, R&D will continue to increase.\nDigital spend is very strategic. As we think about our healthy building initiative and we think about our cold chain initiative and our partnership with AWS there, you're going to see this continuous pivot to recurring revenues and digital solutions. That's going to be very thematic for Carrier for '21, but frankly forever. That's the new normal, and that's a huge focus area for us. And Bobby George and his team have done a superb job really thinking through the future and really pivoting towards this digital model, working with Ajay Agrawal and our aftermarket team to really drive that. And then, we have added sales people. We've said that we would add 500 sales and sales support people this year. We're going to end up this year having done that. And putting more feet on the street to really build that customer intimacy and drive top-line growth that way as well. So, it's a combination of all three.\nJohn Walsh\nAnd then, I guess, maybe sticking to that kind of digital theme, when I look at Carrier's controls business, again, automated logics, but you also have some really big competitors in that space. Where do you see Carrier playing in there? I mean, is there an ability to kind of scale that business up and compete with the number one to number three players in that space, or does something else have to change to really be able to move the controls beyond kind of the HVAC and the Fire & Security system, thinking more about the whole building?\nDavid Gitlin\nYes. You look at our ALC portfolio -- and I think you're right. I don't think we're -- in terms of size, number one or two, but I do think that we're not far down that list. I think, we have the ability to continue to grow that business and improve our share position. We have great technology. We have a very strong market presence. We have the -- because of our portfolio, we have the ability to combine more real estate within the building than others because we have the F&S portfolio, of course, and we have the HVAC piece.\nSo, I think, you're going to see continued investments in growth in the ALC business. But, we're going to overlay it here in the coming months with other aspects of the building management system that can drive healthy building differentiation, and frankly, solutions that not only can interface with our building management system but with other building management systems as well. So, the key is to be able to extract the relevant data from the building and be able to also use controls to influence that data. So, an example I've used is CO2, measure it, see it, and then you can use some controls logic to either anticipate it and pre-ventilate or to actually measure it and then ventilate. So, this is a -- key building management systems, digital and building controls is a huge focus area for us. We're happy with the products we have. We're continuing to invest in that area, and we have new offerings that will be coming out in the first half of next year.\nJohn Walsh\nGreat. I was going to ask next about transportation. So, I think there is certainly some buzz around vaccine deployment, but the big question is how much of that's kind of a onetime bump that you can capitalize versus how much of it is other underlying growth in that market. So, I don't know if maybe you can kind of walk us through how you're thinking about the capacity of that marketplace. And then, obviously, there is a lot of excitement also around kind of last mile delivery too. So, maybe you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Transicold there?\nDavid Gitlin\nSure. I think, about the opportunity really in -- through two lenses. One is capacity and the second is data. I think, the latter is where the biggest opportunity is frankly. I think that clearly, the world is going to -- on the former, the world is going to need more capacity. And it's going to need it at the point of administration. So, if you think about, we were in discussions with one of the states here in the U.S. that was going to administer a lot of this through state fairgrounds and they could really benefit from remote mobile pods, like you have a picture of 40-foot container that we had that we would provide the cooling for, minus 30 degrees C. It extends the life of the Pfizer vaccine or it can house Moderna and the other three.\nSo, you're going to see in various locations around the world, a lot of these -- I think, there's going to be continuous demand for products like that that provide that mobile pod, remote cooling capability at point of administration.\nI think, the more transformative opportunity has to do with data, because whether it's food delivery on the produce side or on -- today on vaccines, one of the big gaps we have is just a lack of a central repository from data from inception to end delivery or administration. And I really do believe that our partnership with AWS is transformative because all of those various handoffs, whether you're looking at food delivery, say, from South America to the United States, you can have 10 handoffs from one refrigerated environment to another, always at ambient temperatures, you have a lot of potential breakpoints, and you don't have one central repository for that data, and that's the same for vaccines. Today, 25% of vaccines never get administered because of issues with the logistics channel or because of the cold chain. So, there's clearly a problem statement, huge opportunity, put the data onto the data lake that we'll develop with AWS, use their AI and ML services capabilities, and then really give value-added services to our customers.\nSo, I think that, number one, we want to be part of the solution with the vaccine distribution; number two, is we do want to add capacity to support; but number three is really leverage this links platform that we're developing to make that again part of the new normal of how vaccines and food get distributed.\nJohn Walsh\nThen, it seems like there is a common thread of collecting and analyzing data that these machines or pieces of equipment are giving off. Do you have any way to help us think about what maybe an attachment rate of that kind of analytical package would be, I don't know, say, for a chiller or for a reefer van? Like, how many times does the customer take that service package or add-on value of analytics?\nDavid Gitlin\nWell, I think, it's still at early stages. And I think that the issue is that today, it's -- it doesn't leverage the entire ecosystem. There are various truck and trailer customers that will kind of combine things like telematics with temperature data and try to leverage that into something that's value-added to them in their operation. The issue is how do we make that more holistic across the ecosystem, across the various handoffs. And I think if you look at the entire ecosystem and you leverage the full capabilities of data, it's a very low, I would say, I don't attachment rate, but it's a very low utilization of what the opportunity is. How many buildings today have the level of kind of automated controls that they could have in the future, especially when you look into measuring and notifying various folks of the full capability? And then, you see the same with the cold chain. I think, that it's just very suboptimized today.\nSo, I would say that when you look at the data opportunities in many areas, you're in the first or second inning of what could be really transformative. And I believe you see that in many industries, but certainly ours is going to be leveraging data and digital to really differentiate the underlying products and provide more value-added services to the customer.\nJohn Walsh\nAnd then, maybe going back to some of your comments around that kind of healthy building or thinking more holistically, I think COVID certainly has brought this into focus. I'm sure you get asked the question all the time, but obviously, now we have these vaccine announcements. Are your customers taking their foot off the gas at all on any of the conversations you're having around indoor air quality, wanting more of this data, does it become less of a priority because of the vaccine, or you don't see that?\nDavid Gitlin\nI haven't seen that. I mean, we're going to have to see. But, I do believe that it will be part of the new normal. Because I think that what's happened is people have become much more aware and concerned about indoor air environments where they never used to even ask the question. So, I think you're going to see -- you could imagine a scenario where before you make a restaurant reservation that you can click and see, you have three choices, which has the best indoor air quality. And I think that even post the vaccine, that's going to be part of people's decision-making. And clearly, we got to get people back into commercial office buildings, but I think they're going to start -- tenants are going to start still asking those questions to give themselves confidence to welcome people back into commercial office buildings before you drop your kids off at school, what is -- people always took indoor air quality for granted. They just assumed that duct work was clean and all that.\nNow, what we've gotten questions on is, in January, for example, we'll be introducing a new home air purifier -- purification system, a B2C kind of air purification system that's coming forward. And a lot of the questions that I have gotten from customers, but frankly, even friends and family is, wait, how effective is it with COVID, but also, I have asthma, will it help with that, or I get allergies in the spring, will it help with that? So, I think that you're going to see these multipurpose kind of units that people say, look, COVID, not the first airborne transmitted disease, won't be the last. So, it's nice to kind of be prepared for whatever happens in the future. Indoor air quality is important. This has shined a light on it. And I think that this is going to be -- I really think it's going to be a critical part of the new normal.\nJohn Walsh\nGreat. And I'm just looking at the clock here. It looks like we have hit the allotted time. So, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the Carrier team for being with us. And we look forward to continuing certainly this dialogue in the future. So, thank you very much.\nDavid Gitlin\nThanks, John. Thanks for having us.\nPatrick Goris\nThank you.\n\n",

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have. I'll now turn the call over to Chris.\nChristopher Klein\nThank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We had a very good third quarter which marks our first anniversary as an independent public company. Our quarter performance was driven by strong growth in sales and profits and was brought across our businesses. We continue to drive profitable growth in a market which continues to recover at an uneven pace. Let me first spent some time on the third quarter highlights and then I will discuss our current thoughts on the full year.\nFirst with regards to the market. The overall home products market and the market for our products again grew mid-single digits in the quarter in line with our assumptions. New construction was strong again in both single family and multifamily starts and the pace of repair and remodel spending increased in the quarter as we expected, with continued consumer caution for big ticket purchases like cabinets. Importantly, we continue to feel confident about our performance in this market and the execution of our strategies as we enter the final quarter of 2012.\nTurning to our performance in the quarter. Sales were up 7% and profits were up 34% from a year ago with all segments performing well. Cabinet sales grew 6% ahead of our estimates for cabinet market growth which we think improved to roughly 3% in the third quarter. Importantly, our profits from cabinets were up over 60% in the quarter. Moen continued its strong performance with sales growth of 12% consistent with the prior quarter. Windows and doors sales were up 7% and as expected the segment generated strong profit gains. Security and storage grew 2% and within the segment, security sales were up 6%.\nNow let me give you some top line highlights by segment. Sales for our Cabinet business were up around 6% for the quarter and met our expectations. We continue to perform well as the market leader in cabinets. The pace of new construction was the key driver as we again saw strength wit dealers and builders in our construction lines. In the dealer channel, where we are the clear market leader, we continue to grow by leveraging our portfolio brands and our strong products and service reputation. We also achieved solid growth in home centers by focusing on more sustainable long-term growth opportunity such as our recently introduced value price point door style for the Thomasville line at The Home Depot and the expansion of our vanities line at Lowe's.\nWe believe innovation and our designer services continue to be competitive advantages in this channel. Importantly, we grew our Cabinet profits over 60% in the quarter. This performance reflects our ability to successfully target growth in channels, markets and product segments that are not as promotionally driven, while continuing to enhance our supply chain efficiencies to improve profitability. We continue to believe that our market leadership combined with our world class operating platform and service levels, provides us strategic flexibility to drive profitable growth today and into the future as the cabinet market recovers.\nPlumbing sales were up 12% in the third quarter moving against our gains in both the U.S. and in our international businesses, particularly China. Gains were strongest in our U.S. wholesale business where we saw continued volume increases driven largely by the pace of new construction. Our efforts over the past few years to build on a leading market share with the top builders and wholesalers, expand into multifamily segment, and upgrade many of our showroom displays have yielded strong results all year and continued to drive sales and profits in the third quarter.\nMoen also continues to see strength from our steady pace of consumer driven innovations. Spot-resistant finishes are rolling out to more and more styles. Our successful Reflex technology for pull-down faucets will soon be launched in pull-out versions. And Moen's latest innovation, MotionSense, a unique hands-free electronic kitchen faucet, has recently begun shipping into both retail and wholesale accounts. Internationally, sales in China where there are now nearly 700 Moen branded stores, were again up strong double-digits over the prior year driven by new construction growth and our continued expansion into tier three and tier four markets. The team in China continues to expand our brand with a wider range of price points and with products suitable to the Chinese market.\nWindow and door sales were up 7% for the quarter. Door products which are heavily driven by new construction, saw double-digit sales gains. We also benefitted from the recently launched relationship with a major window and door company and growth in our wholesale distribution. Windows sales were up modestly driven by new products and growth in targeted channels as the overall window market remained sluggish.\nImportantly, for our three housing related segments, we saw total sales increase of 8% for the third quarter. In security and storage, our sales were up 2% in the quarter. Security again saw broad gains, up mid-single digits driven by three factors. Continued solid growth in global safety solutions, innovative new products and broader placement in retailers especially for the back-to-school season, and strong commercial lock sales. The Master Lock brand is strong and our innovation continues to hit the mark with products like our new electronic combination lock Dial Speed.\nSo to sum up the third quarter, the market continues to be led by significantly stronger new construction and repair and remodel market that while growing, is not yet as strong as a new construction market. I remain very pleased with our performance across the portfolio for both the quarter and year-to-date. With a successful full year as an independent company now behind us, we continue to execute on our strategies, innovate and invest to capture profitable growth opportunities and leverage our market leading positions.\nNow let me turn briefly to our current top line outlook for the remainder of 2012, starting with our assumptions for our market. Lee will then take you through our specific full year outlook in a few moments. From a market perspective we can certainly see signs of improvement relative to a year ago and a firming of the overall market as we enter the fourth quarter. Our consumer related challenges in the housing market remain. New construction was strong in the third quarter as demand for new homes outstripped supply in many markets.\nRepair and remodel growth continued their modest rate as we expected, showed less strength than new construction. Concerns about the general health of the economy and the pace of the recovery are still weighing on consumers\u2019 confidence and their willingness to embrace larger ticket purchases. Our updated full year plans remain built on an assumption that the total market for our home products grows at a mid-single rate. Within that assumption, we continue to expect repair and remodel growth rate of our own 3% to 4% and a new construction growth rate of over 20%. Given our exposure to the slower growth cabinet market, our plans assume that the market for our products goes a bit slower than the overall market but still within the mid-single digit range.\nSo consistent with my comments last quarter based on that market assumption, we continue to expect our 2012 full year sales to increase at a high single-digit pace over 2011, although at the lower end of that range. Our market share gains of the past few years are now beginning to deliver growth and we believe these share gains position us to continue to outperform the market for our products as it strengthens. Importantly, with our only quarter remaining we are narrowing and raising our 2012 EPS guidance range to $0.86 to $0.88 for the full year.\nNow I would like to briefly update you on a couple of exciting recent organizational enhancements. Although a recovery appears to be underway and our performance is strong, we remain keenly focused on staying a chapter ahead of the competition to capture profitable growth, both during and beyond the recovery. Therefore, as part of our talent management processes we have recently made key strategic refinements to our organization which we believe position us even stronger for our next chapter.\nFirst we believe the windows and door businesses are now positioned to leverage common growth opportunities managed together. So the windows and door segment will now be on under the leadership of one operating President, Mark Savan, who will lead the team as they pursue some common growth opportunities. Mark has been with Fortune Brands for over ten years and he was with our (inaudible) and window business through the downturn and previously led our accessories business at Moen.\nThe second move we have made was to match one of our most seasoned executives with our largest business in the early stages of recovery. David Randich will now head our industry leading cabinet business. Our cabinet business has performed very well through the early stages of the recovery but with Dave\u2019s experience we believe we can now maximize the potential of all of our share gains through this next phase of industry\u2019s recovery. Dave, most recently led our Therma-Tru door business through the downturn and has nearly 30 years of experience in managing within the building and residential products industry, including 24 years at Armstrong.\nBoth of these moves reflect our culture of continuous improvement built on our commitment to have the best management team in the industry and to better position these businesses to optimize opportunities both now and beyond recovery.\nSo to sum up. Driven mostly by new construction, the overall market remains firm. We have had strong year-to-date results kept off by another strong quarter and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance. We continue to execute our strategies and remain focused on outperforming the market. We strive to create value by capturing market share, expanding into adjacent markets and improving our operating platforms. We believe our strong brands, management teams and capital structure to provide key flexibilities to focus on profitable growth and should therefore position us to create value at any phase of recovery as we prepare to enter 2013.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Lee who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our outlook.\nLee Wyatt\nThank, Chris. As Brian mentioned, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains which best reflects ongoing business performance. Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $909 million, up 7% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $73 million, up $19 million or 34% compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.29 for the third quarter, up $0.09 or 45% versus the same quarter last year.\nLet me provide a little more color on segment results. Our cabinet sales were $330 million, up $19 million or 6% over the prior year quarter. Operating income for the segment was $13 million versus $8 million in the prior year, up 64% as we benefitted from leverage on higher sales volume to our continually improving supply chain. Year-to-date operating income for the segment was $28 million, pacing well ahead of the prior year. Our strategy is working as planned, and as I mentioned on our last quarterly call, we believe that we will continue to exceed the overall cabinet market growth in the second half by introducing new products and expanding existing programs.\nPlumbing sales for the third quarter were $278 million, up $29 million or 12% versus the prior year quarter. Operating income was $48 million, up $10 million or 25%. Both the U.S. whole sale and China businesses experienced strong double-digit sales growth that drove the overall growth in both segment sales and operating profits.\nWindows and doors sales were $158 million, up $10 million or 7% from the prior year quarter. Within the segment, the door business experienced double-digit growth while the windows business only increased slightly. Operating income for this segment was $6 million, $4 million more than last year as we achieved strong operating leverage on the incremental volume. We continue to expect our windows and doors segment to be profitable for the full year and meaningfully ahead of 2011.\nThird quarter\u2019s storage and security sales were $143 million, up $3 million or 2% versus the prior year quarter. Operating income was $21 million, up $1 million or 4%. Within the segment, security sales increased $6 million or 6% on the strength of U.S. retail and commercial padlocks and global safety, while storage sales declined due to changes in the retail promotional cadence. During the quarter we recognized net charges of $8 million or $0.05, primarily related to the previously announced closing of the cabinet plant in Virginia.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our September 30 balance sheet ended with cash of $216 million. Debt was reduced to $345 million and net debt to EBITDA leverage is now less than 1 at around 0.4 times. We have nothing drawn on our $650 million revolving credit facility and are entering the last quarter of the year where we traditionally generate strong free cash flow. Free cash flow was $167 million year-to-date, including approximately $80 million from option proceeds.\nLet me now provide my thoughts and further detail on our outlook for 2012. As we have said, our approach to planning and providing the annual outlook is three elements, which are market assumption, continued share gains, and business investments. First, with the continuing firming we saw through the third quarter, our market assumption remains the same as we continue to project the market for our markets to lag the overall market in this early stage of a recovery, due to our mix of larger ticket items such as cabinets.\nSecond, our plan still includes continued share gains in addition to overall market growth. And third, while we are pleased with our 2012 performance, we expect significant growth in the out years and want to invest ahead of the opportunity. Therefore, we continue to expect to complete approximately $20 million of incremental investments during 2012.\nSo turning to our outlook details. As Chris mentioned, for the full year our planning assumption remains the same, calling for the market for our products to be up mid-single digits. Based on this market assumption and continued share gains, we continue to expect our full year 2012 sales to increase high-single digits compared to 2011, with all segments increasing. However, as stated before, the sales increase will likely be at the low end of the range.\nBased on our market and sales growth assumption and with only one quarter remaining in the year, we are raising and tightening the range of our 2012 EPS before charges and gains. Our expectations for EPS are now in the range of $0.86 to $0.88. The new mid-point of $0.87 is higher than previous guidance and represents an increase of 45% over 2011 EPS of $0.60. We expect 2012 free cash flow to exceed $275 million after CapEx of between $70 million and $80 million, pension contributions of $20 million and over $80 million in proceeds from option exercises.\nIn summary, our business model continues to perform well and we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. We have raised the midpoint of our EPS outlook for the year, and while the pace and steadiness of market growth is not certain, year-to-date performance further indicates that we should be well positioned to continue to outperform the market at any pace of recovery by leveraging our foundation of leading brands, efficient supply chains, proven management team and strong capital structure.\nI will now turn the call back to Brian.\nBrian Lantz\nThanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks for the third quarter. We will now began taking your questions and we will continue as time allows. So as there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question I will ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions. I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Mike?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Gentlemen, your first question is from the line of Bod Wetenhall from RBC. Your line is open.\nRobert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets\nFantastic quarter. You are obviously doing a great job of outpacing the category like you have been talking about and thanks as well for all the detail. I just wanted to ask Lee, in your press release, you really have no leverage. You are 0.4 times. You are on track to generate $270 million of free cash flow. What's the plan given very very low leverage, investment grade quality balance sheet and all the free cash flow? What's the purpose, what you are going to do with the extra money?\nLee Wyatt\nYet let me, I will answer and then I will turn it to Chris and let him talk about our long-term prospects. But we are generating a lot of cash right now. Still only $200 million on the balance sheet at the end of the third quarter. But we are going to be patient. We do have an authorization for a share repurchase out there. It\u2019s a three-year authorization for $150 million. But I would tell you that we are starting to see the pace on some M&A type calls come in a little bit faster. So there might be some signs that over the next period of time we will see a little bit more of that. So it causes us to be patient and not rush. We have one goal and that is to drive shareholder value to how we use this cash and we are going to be patient and thoughtful to do that. And Chris, I can turn it over to you for....\nChristopher Klein\nYeah, I have always said, Bob, in the past is we are going to look for some combination of acquisitions, share purchase and eventually instituting a dividend. So that remains our long-term plan and the timing will really be dictated by the pace of recovery and the pace of cash accumulation. But you are right, we are starting to accumulate and we will just be prudent on how we deploy it.\nRobert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets\nYou guys have done a very aggressive job of disciplined cost management in terms of SG&A and I was just curious do you think there is further opportunities to drive SG&A lower as a percentage of sales. And if there is, how much is still available to get from that?\nLee Wyatt\nYeah, Bob. On the SG&A side, we have been very aggressive on taking costs out here and we continue to have continuous improvement programs that continue to take some out. But I think the big leverage on SG&A going forward will be on the top line. I think as we drive sales and as we drive better margins out of that, we will see the leverage on the SG&A. I don\u2019t think you will see broad SG&A reductions as such, although you always get some from us. But the bigger issue on SG&A is just leveraging the top line growth as this market recovers and as we continue to take share.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDaniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse\nYou are talking about, in cabinets, introducing in Thomasville line a value area. And I was just wondering as you about sort of the remodeling activity picking up where it\u2019s going to be essentially a bit less value focused as you think of ahead of to, call it 2013 or \u201914, how is the product offering that you are thinking about for that in terms of margin rich areas to help margins of business there?\nChristopher Klein\nDan, as we play across 80% of the price points in the market. All the way from custom at the top end down to stock-in stock at the bottom. So we are really set up to take whatever the consumer demand is and convert it. And we have a very strong semi-custom offering in the dealer network as well as at all three home centers. We have done a little bit of this drop down with value brands and I think that is appropriate, for certain part of the population it will always be appropriate. For certain consumer out there looking for a good quality yet at a very reasonable price. We would rather do that and invest in those kinds of products than simply continue to promote and discount, and basically give our product away. We would rather match the quality of the product to the price point and deliver it such. That\u2019s our preference there.\nBut you are right, over time I think you will see consumers starting to spend a little bit more. They can really get good value all the way up the continuum. So as they move up into a higher quality product, there is good value in that as well, and then normally up in the custom. So I just like the way we are positioned by channel and by price segment to really take the market however it comes back.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.\nPeter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird\nChris, just on that last question. Can you give us a sense as to whether or not you are seeing a consumer at all, from a willingness perspective, go up the price point chain and/or whether or not dollar projects are increasing at all?\nChristopher Klein\nI haven\u2019t seen anything notable yet. I think there is still -- it\u2019s not getting worse. So that\u2019s good. Correct. So (inaudible) the average price won't go down. So I think the overall therma market is reasonably stable. We are still the least aggressive among the three in the promotional cadence. And we have seen consumers respond to the kind of quality and new products that we are putting in there without heavy promotion. So that\u2019s a good sign too. But we haven\u2019t seen them aggressively start to move up that continuum. I think we are still waiting for a little bit more confidence in the market overall.\nPeter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird\nGot it. Okay. And then you have done a very nice job obviously with share gains here in \u201912. As you look to 2013, how do those share gains kind of layer in when you think about 2013 growth? And what sorts of key growth opportunities from a share perspective might you have in 2013?\nChristopher Klein\nYou know I think it really depends on how the market comes back. What you are seeing right now is a byproduct of three to five years of activity across all of our product lines to gain share positions. We certainly see enough volume flowing through them to convert it to revenue and profits. So you are starting to see that and you will continue to see that. So on the new construction side, we will continue to see faster growth for us than for our competitors because we have got good, strong share position. So as you see that new construction flowing through faucets, entry doors and cabinetry, you are going to see some of that drive through. And then across all other channels similarly.\nSo it will really depend, one, on when the volume comes back, we could bring a new products and drive-in for new accounts every day. But I think the bigger leverage comes off of the volume coming into the share positions that we have got established.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates\nFirst question on the cabinets market. I think the incremental margins for this year may have been closer to 20% and I think historically or as you look out over the cycle, you would hope or tie that to be something closer to 30. So can you maybe just talk through the puts and takes so far this year on what's limited that and how you guys think about that margin recovery in that business.\nLee Wyatt\nYeah. The expectation that we have over time on leverage -- and cabinets is part of the overall mix of 25% to 30% incremental margin. And I think what's happening is we see the sales growth, the volume growth, on the base we are going to see nice leverage where -- so we will get a volume component but there is also a plant efficiency component that you are seeing this year. We have over the past several years as we have restructured that footprint, we become much more efficient and every day we work on efficiencies. We closed the plants in the third quarter just because we thought we could do that because the efficiencies were growing to a point where we wouldn\u2019t hurt long-term capacity but we could become more efficient.\nI think you are seeing some of those benefits. So I think as sales grow we are at that point right now, we are about $1.3 billion in revenue run rate basis. And that\u2019s kind of that point where you start -- you are really getting nice leverage over that footprint as it grows and as the market recovers. So I think that\u2019s what you are seeing now.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates\nOkay. And then separately with the guidance, correct me if I am wrong, but it sounded like you kind of bumped down sales guidance a little bit but bumped up the EPS range. So can you just talk to the puts and takes there on what changed relative to last quarter?\nLee Wyatt\nYou know year-to-date, two-three quarters a row about 7.8%. We think 7% revenue guidance is a good number. You could be a 7% for the year and still have fourth quarter in that 5% to 7% range. So we think that\u2019s reasonable given that all in all it still remains uncertain. We think as we have always told you at least for the last two quarters that our growth would be 3% to 4% annually. But still choppy. And so we are a little cautious there.\nI think the real story is on the EPS side because two things are driving this ability to take EPS growth up on sales in roughly the same range. And that\u2019s an improving mix of our business and our supply chain efficiencies across our business. Let met talk about each of those.\nSo the mix is improving. That\u2019s a reflection of our disciplined approach and our leadership across all of our business segments. We are growing and going after those businesses that have the high margin and those are the ones that you will see growing. You are seeing Moen grow 12%, Master Lock 6%, doors double-digits. You are seeing the cabinet growth at 6% being in the higher margin pieces because we are not chasing the promotional stuff. The things you are not seeing grow as much right now would be that high promotion cabinet things because we are just not going to chase that. Windows, lower margins. We are not going to chase incrementally low margin stuff there. Still have strong business in windows but just not going to change that incremental low margin sale.\nAnd storage, which is low margin, is actually down a little bit in the third quarter. So I think that mix is reflecting our discipline and our leadership in being able to grow those parts of the business that are going to drive the most profit and that\u2019s a big part of our strategy going forward in this recovery. The other thing is the supply chain efficiency and you are seeing that across all of our businesses. It\u2019s the things we have done in the past and that we continue to do from a continuous improvement and some modest restructuring now that allows us to drive that efficiency. So the volumes grow from a recovery and we continue to take share. You are going to see nice leverage.\nThat\u2019s why we think 25% to 30% over the long-term is a nice leverage ratio. And by the way in the third quarter we levered it 31% even with some modest investments. So we feel good about where we are.\nDennis McGill - Zelman & Associates\nCan I just push on the 5% to 7% top line? What would be the driver either by segment or end channel for the deceleration? That would seem like you would have a tailwind and acceleration in new construction. And you are describing a remodeling market that\u2019s holding pretty steady.\nChristopher Klein\nBut I think if you look at the third quarter, you would see home business was up 8% and then our security and storage was up about 2%. And there is two pieces in that, the security and storage. Master Lock grew nicely but the storage piece was a little lower. Same thing with windows, windows only grew slightly in the business. So I think if you think the fourth quarter looked something like the third quarter in terms of sales, you could see that 7% number could be a little lower than that just because security and storage stays down about 2% and windows, given the R&R market being choppy right now. You could see being on 6% or 5% or something.\nBut our business is strong, our business remains on strong. We feel good about that. We are just -- with the lumpiness of the R&R, we are just a little cautious on the top line.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nKenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets\nGiven the rising demand, are you guys -- this is a price question -- what was kind of pricing in the quarter and are you able to realize pricing increases in any categories? And if so, is it more tied to demand or innovation?\nLee Wyatt\nOur pricing comes in two flavors. The first is to the extent commodities, there is commodity inflation, we are able to price and it\u2019s pretty much dollar for dollar, if you look at the last three or five year period. Now pricing always lags the inflation increase but it\u2019s a little sticky on the backend. So we tend to be able to price through that. And that\u2019s what we saw coming into this year. I think as we have told you the last two quarters and that pricing has stopped. The other way we get pricing is just through all the innovation that we do. And that\u2019s just embedded in that. So we feel good about our brand strength, our channel strength. That what allows us to price the way we do. But we also want to be thoughtful about it. But we feel good about our ability to get prices.\nKenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets\nOkay. I guess my follow-ups kind of -- it\u2019s related to that. But the pricing, to the extent you are talking about dollar for dollar. Given what commodity pricing has done to -- are you kind of set to have actually somewhat of a tailwind next year? And then second, if you could expand on comments, perhaps with the channel wholesalers or others. Kind of talk to about in terms of how they are carrying the inventory? Are the pre-buying, are they still running very thin -- that would be good. Thank you.\nLee Wyatt\nI will take commodity and pricing and let Chris do the last piece. We came into this year saying that we would have a tailwind from pricing last year, from \u201911. And we thought we would have a pricing of about $30 million tailwind coming into the year. And I think we said at the beginning of the year, we would have new commodity costs of about $20 million with probably -- our new pricing of about $20 million, additional new commodity inflation of about $35 million. So we take that $30 million tailwind coming into the year, we would give back probably $15 million and we would then have about $15 of a tailwind this year.\nAnd that\u2019s kind of how it\u2019s played out. It\u2019s been very close to that. We may have picked up a couple of million dollars on some commodities that are a little better but we have got other commodities that aren\u2019t. Hardwoods have not come down, resins and paints have not come down. Diesel fuel is still $3.90 or so. For us, labor cost in China is the other piece that has not come down, actually increased. So we are kind of where we thought we would be for the year. I don\u2019t think we will have a tailwind going into next year. I think we could have kind of a flat to maybe a slight headwind, but it will be very manageable.\nChristopher Klein\nIn terms of inventory, if we look across kind of wholesale channels and home center accounts, I would say folks have been pretty disciplined about inventory out there. We are mostly replenishing the POS. It\u2019s not perfect but that\u2019s kind of how they are wearing in. I think that\u2019s healthy. I also think they are relying on our ability to respond. We have kind of surged and then cut off many times here over the last three, four years and so unfortunately we have gotten pretty good at that. And we are pretty reliable in being able to meet demands. And so I think folks out there are just being prudent and not carrying too much excess inventory?\nKenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets\nHave you picked up any business due to other competitors fill rates not being able to be as flexible?\nChristopher Klein\nEven there it\u2019s interesting. I think it\u2019s just starting. I think that will continue. But we have seen in a little bit because -- and I am not sure they are all as flexible as we have become. And so we have gotten a little bit and we are watching it. That just started to kind of happen over the last 6-8 weeks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Rehaut - JPMorgan\nThanks. Good afternoon. Nice quarter everyone. First question on the cabinet segment. Look like the industry is growing 2%, 3%. Last quarter you were just 0.5% of growth as you kind of walked away from some of the more promotional type product. You have been able to get back with the 6% rate and I think saying that you are still trying to stay away from the promotional side of the spectrum. So what -- I guess the first question really the long winded is, is the growth consistent from a market side? 2%, 3%, is that kind of surprising you maybe on the downside and any kind of color in term of perhaps level of promotional activity as you have now gone, had a much better growth number in the third quarter. Has the promotional activity eased it all or what allowed you to have that better rate?\nChristopher Klein\nSo a couple of questions in there, I guess. First off, in terms of the marketplace I would say we are not at all just pointed on the new construction side. I think there is strong demand there and well, we are being selective there too. There is plain demand to go around. On the R&R side, you know it is just slowed to recover and I think you are seeing it across other big ticket categories, applying to cabinets. And I think places where it\u2019s thousands of dollars, consumers are still being cautious. So it\u2019s improving. It\u2019s better than it was a year ago. I think it\u2019s more sustained. It\u2019s less up and down. It\u2019s more consistent. I think the fact that we were more disciplined over the last couple of quarters on promotion and yet really held our share positions in there, speaks to the new product, the service and a number of other things. Which is all good signs because it means that consumers are discriminating, going with higher quality, better service, designers are following.\nSo I think those are all good signs of a healthy recovering R&R model. It is just going to take a little while to gather momentum. And that\u2019s just kind of the realty of where we are in. So I think it\u2019s in an emerging healthy category. It\u2019s going in kind of the right ways at the right pace and I would rather have it do this and year-over-year build a little bit momentum as opposed to we have kind of shot in the arm then fall back down again. I kind of feel like this is -- we are on a good sustained track but it just can take a little while. New construction, I think is going to be a continued catalyst for some growth across cabinets and frankly across a lot of the categories.\nMichael Rehaut - JPMorgan\nAnd then in terms of the pace of promotional activity from 2Q to 3Q, has that changed at all?\nChristopher Klein\nI think it\u2019s about the same. I mean for us we are flat to the prior year, others are promoting on a higher level than we are, but they have been promoting than we have for a while. So I think they are probably cycling flat but at a higher level is the way I describe it. So that\u2019s kind of what we are seeing. We are pretty consistent, others tend to cycle then and now but if I try to average it through, I think they are just -- if you total it all up they are just consistent there at a little bit higher level but it\u2019s not getting worse.\nMichael Rehaut - JPMorgan\nHow would also characterize the plumbing markets growth relative to your growth. I mean I think if you perhaps strip out, let's say and just look domestically maybe you would take a point or two off the growth rate to adjust for China. But how are you looking at that pipe of growth rate relative to your own?\nLee Wyatt\nYou know there are no published indices for the plumbing space. I can tell you this, we have been very consistent. And the way I think you look at that is you look at the first three quarters of this year. In the first quarter, Moen grew 20%. We called out 7% of that being wholesale inventory fill where they were just building some inventory. We said China grew 3% and the core grew around 10%. So it\u2019s your 20% growth in the first quarter. Second quarter, China grew 3%, core grew 9%. 12% growth. Third quarter, China grew 3% in terms of the points and the core grew 9%. So 12% again. So what we have done is settled into a very nice yet very strong cadence here of our growth and we don\u2019t think anybody is going faster than that.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Zahid Siddique from Gabelli & Company. Your line is open.\nZahid Siddique - Gabelli & Company\nJust a couple of questions. The first one on the poison pill. I just wanted to confirm that it has expired, I believe it was supposed to expire in early October?\nChristopher Klein\nYes, it has.\nZahid Siddique - Gabelli & Company\nOkay. So there is no poison pill currently. The second question I have is, you mentioned that you are getting some calls on the M&A front. Could you comment on what areas are those calls coming from?\nChristopher Klein\nYeah, I won't go into any specifics, but I would say it was kind of quiet up until the summer and I expected that it would start to wake up over a 12-18 month time period and I think it has. I think there is a number of different sectors where things are getting busy again and I think that\u2019s surprising given any business that\u2019s touching new construction is feeling the effects of a pretty good six to nine months here. And so you have got folks who have been waiting to maybe start a business for quite some time. A little bit of momentum builds a case for better forward look. So I think that pace will pick-up and we are just starting to see it. So that\u2019s an encouraging sign. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rushing ahead. But there is a little bit more discussion and chatters than there was certainly six months ago.\nOperator\nAnd your final question comes from the line of Stephen East from ISI Group. Your line is open.\nStephen East - ISI Group\nChris, could you just talk -- you talked that R&R is getting better and I was interested in what type of trends you are seeing through the quarter with R&R? And then really your channel performances also. You talked about new construction being strong but was there an acceleration through the quarter that type of thing. And why you are really seeing at the home centers?\nChristopher Klein\nSure. I think R&R was -- it has been in interesting year. Things started off strong, decelerated a bit as we kind of moved into May-June, little quiet and then woke up again kind of August-September and into the first couple of weeks of October we are seeing kind of order patterns consistent with what we saw in September. So I think that 3% to 4% feels pretty good rolling through. I like the consistency across the businesses. I also like the geographic consistency. So that just says, it\u2019s more tied to overall economic recovery albeit at a pretty small pace if you look at GDP, look at credit availability and consumer confidence. You know it\u2019s a very slow walk.\nSo it\u2019s picking up. It is picking up consistently and it is pretty wide spread across a number of categories. And the one category we keep on a little bit weaker is the window marketplace, it\u2019s a little bit weaker, and big ticket. But I think it\u2019s kind of moving across that direction. In terms of channels, we have got wholesale channels, we have got dealer channels in cabinet, we have got two step distribution in doors. And I think they are kind of responding to where the demand is coming back. So those that are heavily influenced by new construction are doing very well. I think we see that the channel is much more R&R related. They are certainly better than they were a year ago but they have got a long ways to go. So they have started to pickup but it isn\u2019t kind of great charging growth.\nStephen East - ISI Group\nAnd then you talked about how you would grow and you mentioned expanding into related platforms. Could you talk about what you are doing now? I know you don\u2019t want to talk about what may come down the road but what you are doing now and looking at?\nChristopher Klein\nYeah, we have got a number of adjacent market places that we have expended organically into over the years and those are great opportunities to look at continued investment organically, whether it\u2019s potential acquisitions or joint ventures. So if you look across our businesses and our plumbing business with Moen, it\u2019s just such a terrific brand. Great distribution both in North America as well as in China and some other international markets. And so there are a number of things we can extend into under that brand that leverages the distribution, leveraged the supply chain. So there is expansion opportunities there. We look across our security market. Similarly with Master Lock, very very strong brand. Strong supply chain, great distribution. So where else can we extend into security products. And you are going to see a lot more of these things at least organically coming out in terms of new products or introductions over the next few quarters. In security we are investing more and more into electronics and you will see more electronic products that we are just getting ready to introduce right now. So that cadence will build up.\nThat naturally leads to areas where you might expand through acquisitions because you could expand geographically or you could expand into some of these adjacencies and then you get there a little bit faster. But I kind of like to stay near the core of the start and be able to extend some distribution, some brand or some supply chain and then expand out from there.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions at this time, I would turn the call back over to Mr. Brian Lantz for closing remarks.\nBrian Lantz\nThank you.

My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nMiss Liddle, you begin your conference.\nLynn Liddle\nThanks, Kelly. Good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. We are going to follow our usual pattern of some prepared remarks by our Chief Financial Officer and our CEO and then we\u2019ll open it up for question and answer. We do set this up as an investor call, so I\u2019ll kindly ask the members of the media to be in listen-only mode and I\u2019ll also turn all of your attention to our Safe Harbor statement in the event that any forward-looking statements are made.\nAnd with that, I\u2019d like to introduce our new CFO but long-time Domino's team member, Jeff Lawrence.\nJeff Lawrence\nThank you, Lynn and good morning everyone. Before we discuss the results for the third quarter, I\u2019d like to make some brief comments on our recently announced proposed refinancing of our capital structure.\nAs communicated in our September 28 press release, the company intends to issue approximately $1.5 billion of new fixed rate notes in the fourth quarter. We plan to use the proceeds of the $1.5 billion issuance to call and retire at par $551 million of existing 2012 fixed rate notes, to pay transaction fees, and use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The refinancing would bring our total debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio from approximately 3.6 times at the end of Q3 to approximately 5.8 times at closing. The company also expects to enter into a new $125 million variable funding note facility which would replace our existing $100 million facility.\nDue to security law restrictions, we are unable to go into any more detail today or answer any questions regarding this proposed refinancing. We appreciate your understanding. We do plan to have a follow-up call with investors at the conclusion of the refinancing, and we will announce the date for that call at a later time.\nLet\u2019s now move on to our third quarter results. This quarter, our domestic and international divisions again posted very strong same store sales growth, and we opened a significant number of new stores globally. Our earnings per share grew 6.3% over the prior year; we are pleased with these results particularly in the face of continued foreign exchange headwinds and an insurance charge we took during the quarter that I will discuss in more detail in a moment.\nGlobal retail sales which are total retail sales at franchise and company owned stores worldwide grew 6.1%. When we exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 15.2%. The drivers of this retail sales growth include domestic same store sales, which rose by 10.5% in the quarter, broken down our U.S. franchise business was up 10.4% while our corporate stores were up 11.5%. Both of these comp increases were driven primarily by traffic or order count growth. We also saw some ticket growth during the quarter.\nWe are also pleased to report that we opened 14 net domestic stores in the third quarter consisting of 24 store openings and 10 closures. Over the past four quarters, we have opened 96 net domestic stores. Our international division had another strong quarter as same store sales grew 7.7% collecting a prior year quarter increase of 7.1%. This marked the 87th consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth for our international business.\nOur international business also grew by 188 stores during Q3, comprised of 201 store openings and 21 closures. Over the past four quarters, we have added 742 net stores internationally.\nTurning to revenues, total revenues were up $38 million or 8.5% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of three factors. First, higher supply chain center food volumes driven by strong U.S. comps as well as increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our global store reimaging program. These supply chain increases were partially offset by lower commodity prices.\nSecond, higher domestic same-store sales and store count growth resulted in increased royalties from our franchise stores and higher revenues at our company-owned stores. And finally, higher international royalties, again from increased same-stores sales and store count growth, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates.\nCurrency exchange rates negatively impacted us again this quarter by $5.5 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against most of our currencies. So far this year, foreign currency has negatively impacted revenues by $13.5 million. When we look at current projections, we now estimate that foreign currency could have an $18 million to $20 million negative impact on revenues for the full year 2015. You will note that this range is substantially higher than what we estimated back in January at our investor day. At that time, we gave you a range of between $8 million and $12 million, so foreign currencies have negatively impacted us to a much greater degree than any of us had expected.\nTo put it in perspective, our 2015 global retail sales would have been more than $1 billion higher if we had used 2011 exchange rates. The good news in all of this is that we have continued to drive strong sales internationally and performed well on the bottom line despite this substantial headwind. And if currencies moderate over time, this could eventually become a nice tailwind for us.\nNow moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter decreased to 29.3% from 29.9% in the prior year quarter. The main driver of this decrease was the previously reported $5.7 million pre tax insurance charge reported in Q3. This was related to updated independent actuarial estimates for our casualty insurance program. This $0.06 per share charge was reported in cost of goods sold in both our supply chain and domestic stores segments. Consolidated operating margin was also pressured by the aforementioned foreign exchange headwinds, which does impact international margins.\nOperating margins benefited from lower commodity costs in the quarter and higher sales in all business segments. Looking at company-owned stores, operating margin there decreased to 19% from 23%, again driven primarily by the insurance charge, similarly supply chain margin decreased to 10.2% from 10.3% also due primarily to the insurance charge offset in part by lower commodity costs.\nAs a reminder, commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar mark up to our franchisees, therefore lower commodity prices do not impact our supply chain dollar process, they do, however, positively impact our supply chain margin when looked at as a percentage of revenues.\nThe average cheese block price in the third quarter was $1.69 per pound versus $2.04 in the same period last year. This led to our overall market basket decreasing 5.7% as compared to the prior year quarter. Based on current forecast, we now expect that commodities we use will be down approximately 5% to 7% in 2015 compared to 2014 levels.\nLet\u2019s now shift to G&A. G&A increased by $4.8 million in the third quarter versus the prior year quarter due to several factors. Our planned investments in our team primarily in e-commerce, technology, and international drove most of this increase. Our higher same-store sales also led to increases in volume driven expenses such as variable performance based compensation, company-owned store advertising, and franchisee incentives.\nAs we have noted before, this 2015 fiscal year does include an extra week. We continue to project that our G&A will be in the range of $270 million to $275 million for the 53-week year. We estimate that the extra week will drive approximately $4 million of this G&A expense.\nSwitching to income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 37.6% for the quarter. We continue to expect that 37% to 38% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our third quarter net income was up $2.2 million. This 6.2% increase was primarily driven by higher comps, both domestically and internationally, global store growth, and increased supply chain volumes. Our improved results were partially offset by the negative impact of the insurance charge and foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur third quarter diluted EPS was $0.67, this is a $0.04 or 6.3% increase from the $0.63 EPS in the third quarter of last year. Here\u2019s how that $0.04 difference breaks down. The insurance charge negatively impacted us by $0.06. Foreign currency negatively impacted us by another $0.06. Lower dilutive share count primarily due to our share repurchases benefited us by $0.01 and most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.15.\nNow turning to our use of cash. We repurchased and retired approximately 365,000 shares for $41 million or an average price of approximately $112 per share during the quarter. We also returned more than $16 million to our shareholders in the form of our quarterly dividend.\nOverall, our global momentum again resulted in great comps and store growth. Thank you for your time today. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrick.\nPatrick Doyle\nThanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m proud to be reporting the third quarter as mostly more of the same. The business and brand continue to thrive as a top performer in the industry and franchisees, both domestic and abroad continually impress me with the way they meet the challenge of sustained success as they continue to pile up points from the scoreboard.\nI believe the fundamental strength of our business is the foundation of our success, despite some of the headwinds we faced this quarter. In fact, we were able to take those hits better precisely because we are growing so strongly. I am proud of our results and our continued product and technology innovation. Our strategies are working, fundamentals continue to strengthen and the results and returns to shareholders speak for themselves.\nFranchisees, store managers and our team members are simply getting the job done. Focussing on our domestic business our emphasis on innovation and execution continues to fuel tremendous brand momentum. Franchisees and corporate store operators are all in executing at the highest level I have seen during my time as CEO, notably related to service and for our franchisees strategic growth. Because of this, we delivered strong double digit performance marking our 18th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales in the U.S. and continue to move forward on domestic store growth.\nWe are also closing in nicely in our goal of having 2000 stores in the U.S. reimaged by year end. There is never a better time to grow within Dominos and franchisee profitability well on its way \u2013 is well on its way to surpassing average EBITDA of $100,000 per store for 2015. And I am pleased to see more and more franchisees understand that and act upon it as we see the strong return on investment generating increasing store growth.\nAfter thoughtful planning and testing, we announced our first nationwide loyalty program early in the fourth quarter, both the intent and execution are simple, sign up order on-line or via mobile app and start earning points towards free pizza. We\u2019ve seen what loyalty programs do for customers across many different industries and it was time for us to get in the game. We expect to drive order frequency and connect with customers through our unmatched digital experience.\nWe take the same strategic approach with menu expansion and believe it is best to take our time when launching new products with the full intention of their remaining permanent menu items. Our marbled cookie brownie which launched in mid September is a good example of that, and we are excited to introduce our first dessert item in over five years.\nSwitching to technology, the story continues to be about investing in innovation. Technology is now an absolutely critical part of our brand and an undeniable element of what Dominos stands for. We don\u2019t just talk about innovating, it\u2019s generating real results. And for the second time this year we are using national television to promote a technology driven message.\nWe are promoting and continuing to introduce many digital platforms available to customers including text and tweet to order, Smart TV, Smart Watch, Ford SYNC and voice ordering via our virtual ordering assistant, Dom. These platforms are unmatched technology first and have been effective in keeping Dominos top of mind and at the forefront of the digital curve something we are very proud of.\nWe are seeing the positive impact of our online pizza profiles. In just over two years since the launch, 40% of our digital users have now created a profile and are able to use its many benefits including easy order, saved order and payment information and now our loyalty program. So continuing the theme of keeping the momentum going especially within the technology space, we are proud of our position as a digital leader. We respect the technology\u2019s impact on our performance and results, and we continue to make the investments needed to maintain this lead.\nTurning to our international division, the segment performed yet again, with very strong sales comp of 7.7% and stand out sales performances included the U.K. Australia and Canada and we are pleased with the unit growth in India and Japan among others.\nHere is an impressive number regarding store growth. 742 net store openings on a 12-month trailing basis helped by a solid showing in the third quarter of 180 net openings. We have now exceeded 7000 total stores outside of the U.S. This milestone is a credit to our master franchisees who continue to introduce and grow the Dominos brand in both developed and emerging markets across the globe in remarkable fashion.\nOne of those new markets which we just announced on Monday is one that may know a thing or two about pizza, Italy. We are excited to be partnering with our master franchisee e-pizza which will operate Dominos locations under the name, Dominos Pizza Italia beginning this week from its first store in Milan. The current plan is to open three stores in Milan by year\u2019s end so while the market will take its time and is certainly in its infancy one thing is for certain, Italy loves it pizza as the Italians reportedly eat it seven times a month. As was noted by e-pizza\u2019s management in this week\u2019s announcement, we also continue to work together with our master franchisees to help them grow their digital presence or reach full digital capability within their market.\nWe currently have 11 markets using their global online ordering platform with digital sales mix and participating markets increasing rapidly. I\u2019m not only pleased to see digital growth in most markets but I\u2019m particularly encouraged to see the results of our collaboration with master franchisees come to life.\nIn closing, our sales and growth continue to demonstrate unparallel strength and sustain success despite facing headwinds. We\u2019ve proven we will be strategic in our decisions and growth plans. We\u2019ve proven we will innovate, we\u2019ve proven to have an industry leading international model and we\u2019ve proven we will continue to respect and aggressively pursue the challenge of sustaining our success.\nThanks for your time and I\u2019ll now open it up for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley\nJohn Glass\nThanks very much. In the spirit of understanding, you don't want to talk about the current debt offering, is there any way or anything you can say about how philosophically you view returning that amount of cash to investors?\nPatrick Doyle\nJohn, I really can\u2019t get into that right now as we are kind of in the middle of that process.\nJohn Glass\nGot it. And then \u2013 so on these two other things, then one small and one larger. One, just on the insurance charge on this quarter, I understand where it came from. Is that recurring? Was that a catch up, how does one pick those numbers and think about the P&L going forward?\nPatrick Doyle\nI think there are really a couple of things there. I mean first what is most important is that our team members get home safely, and we had a couple of very serious accidents that drove essentially half of that charge. One was right at the end of the covered period as we went into kind of the actuarial study that we have done annually in the past, infact we are going to do that twice a year going forward now which you know should help smooth out any movement on that. That charge, we\u2019ve gone through the same process every year in the past, we do it once a year and we\u2019ve never had a change on that accrual of more than half a million to a million dollars.\nSo -- the big move and there were two accidents that drove a lot of it. But I will tell you at the beginning of the year we had an increase in frequency of incidents, and some of the severity of incidents, and we take that very seriously. The trend is already getting better on that, but we\u2019ve got to manage that closely and carefully and most importantly because we want everybody who is working for us to get home safely at the end of the day.\nSo you know some of that is hopefully going to be more in the one-time category as long as we can manage this carefully going forward. That would be -- our expectation is that we would get it back down. I will tell you that we have had a long term trend of being flat to down on incidents in the system, and it was troublesome that it picked up. So we\u2019re on top of it, we are going to manage it carefully, you know I can\u2019t emphasize enough what matters more than anything is that people are getting home safely and we\u2019re going to aggressively manage it going forward.\nJohn Glass\nThanks for that. If I could just sneak in one more. Patrick, you said that you were advertising nationally, I think you said for the first time sort of your digital capacity and all the different ways you can order. Is it true, is that what you said and was that a fourth quarter event or did you do that during the third quarter? And if it was during the third quarter, you know is that the kind of thing that really gives a breakthrough message and gives increases or gives a step function up of digital orders as a percentage of the total?\nPatrick Doyle\nYes I think some of that platform, and as we were talking about kind of anywhere came right at the end of the third quarter. You know but this is the first time we\u2019ve gone out and really talked about how all of these different places that you can order through Dominos and make it as easy as possible for people to access our brands, but this is really about the fourth quarter. It may have hit right at the end of the third, but effectively it started early in the fourth quarter.\nJohn Glass\nOkay, right. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.\nAlton Stump\nThank you and good morning.\nJeff Lawrence\nHow are you Alton?\nAlton Stump\nToo good, thanks. I guess just looking back on the operational front, obviously there is a fair amount of noise of currency and also the insurance claims in the quarter. But as you look at what's driving your comp performance, obviously, I want to talk about technology, have you seen any difference in the pace that's even better now than it was couple of quarters ago that you're seeing as a comp lift from technology or is it slowing down, I just wanted to sort of get your update on how much of a lift we're seeing or what the pace of that lift is coming from technology on comps in general?\nJeff Lawrence\nYes. We feel very good about it clearly, and you know the comps both domestically and internationally were obviously extremely strong. I think there is \u2013 we continue to find new ways to drive the business with technology, what we're able to do with the analytics around the technology as people are on these digital platforms are terrific. But I'll tell you the other thing that just adds into this tremendously is the overall momentum in the business, the energy from our franchisees, the level of execution as we're driving success overall, there is a certain amount of the success that we're experiencing right now that frankly can only be contributed to kind of the collective momentum within the system.\nIt's driving terrific profitability for the franchisees as we've said in the script. Our expectation after 89,000 of profits last year as average for our domestic franchisees, our expectation is that we will be 100 plus which has been a goal of ours for some time. And that means that they're excited, they're reinvesting, they are driving the business forward, so there are lot of things that are playing into this, but clearly digital continues to be front and center and it\u2019s an important part of the story both domestically and internationally.\nAlton Stump\nThat's helpful. And then just quick follow-up on that, just the loyalty program, how big of a deal you think that could be or could drive even higher comp growth even sort off the base or is it more about getting data back that you can use going forward, just some color on that would be great?\nPatrick Doyle\nYes. it just started in the fourth quarter, so I really can't get into it, I guess what I would say is we wouldn't roll it nationally if we didn't think it was going to be a positive contributor to our success going forward, but its really a fourth quarter event.\nAlton Stump\nGot you. Make sense. Thank, Patrick.\nPatrick Doyle\nThank you, Alton.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs\nKaren Holthouse\nHi. Congratulations on another fantastic quarter, guys.\nPatrick Doyle\nThank you, Karen.\nKaren Holthouse\nSo, one quick housekeeping question and then a real question. Can we get the breakdown of that insurance charged between the company's store line item and the supply chain?\nPatrick Doyle\nYes, Karen, the overall charge on a pretax basis was $5.7 million, $4.3 million of that was reported in cost of goods sold. In the domestic store segment where team USA our corporate operations reside and $1.4 million of it was booked in supply chain.\nKaren Holthouse\nAnd then, one of the actually quick insurance question, is there any chance that if you says there is a handful accents that were at the beginning of the year that weather might have played a factor in that and we could hope for reversal next year?\nPatrick Doyle\nNo.\nKaren Holthouse\nOkay.\nPatrick Doyle\nI mean, some of it can be attributed to simply the growth in the business that we've had and -- but at the end of the day the weather, I mean, its bad weather every winter. And so no \u2013 look we're going to manage aggressively. We have been as we saw it in the first quarter a couple of these were -- two were severe accidents that drove about half of this. But at the end of the day that's still not acceptable. We've got to manage it well and aggressively and we're doing that. Certainly it is our hope that we are going to get this back down. We're already seeing some good trend on that. But there are no excuses around this with weather or anything else. We've got to manage it aggressively.\nKaren Holthouse\nGreat. And then, the real question, on the royalty program is it early enough that we can get any sense from test markets, what expectations around how incremental it could be to check a traffic? And then thinking the ramp what's sort of the plan for advertising and either to existing pizza profile or as to people who order digitally but on profiled versus broader just national advertising campaign for it?\nPatrick Doyle\nKaren, I think we can't into that, I mean, it's in the fourth quarter and I guess I'll repeat what I said to Alton. We wouldn't roll it out if we didn't believe in it, we've rolled it out nationally, but I'm not going to get anything, that's going to kind of indicate where we are with fourth quarter results.\nKaren Holthouse\nThank you.\nPatrick Doyle\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh\nGreat. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the discrepancy maybe between the company-owned store comps and the franchise comps, could any of that have been due to the loyalty test that you had in place?\nPatrick Doyle\nNo. You're looking at about one point differential. And I guess what I would tell you is anything within a couple of points are being the same is frankly the range that we would generally expect. We're in seven or eight markets with our corporate stores, there is always going to be some kind of regional differentiation in terms of performance and anything within a couple of points between the two is I think kind of expected.\nPeter Saleh\nGreat. And just last question, just talk about maybe little bit about the decision to launch a dessert item. Haven't launched a new dessert items in many years, but why launch dessert item rather than sticking with your core on something more innovative on the Pizza side?\nPatrick Doyle\nYes. Well, first of all, you may have notice we're not advertising it on television right now. We're advertising our digital and kind of the core of our business where the add dollars are going. So the Marbled Cookie Brownie is being done online and with prints. And I guess the bottom line for what do you do it is people like dessert. It is a nice add-on and generally when you're talking about something that is not center of the plate, it is going to have less effect on order growth than pizza or something that's kind of more the main meal. And this is something that is not happening within our television right now.\nSo, the answer is this is more about kind of add-on. It's more about potentially driving a little bit of ticket. But the assumption of your question is correct, which is something like this is not going to be as focused on order count growth as perhaps pizza might be. We're advertising around access to the brands, digital innovation that's far more about order growth than the Marbled Cookie Brownie would be.\nPeter Saleh\nGreat. Thank you very much.\nPatrick Doyle\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company.\nBrian Bittner\nThanks. Congratulations guys. Question about the assets. I understand reimaging the assets may be a bit less important than a non-delivery Company. But now that you do have a pretty good amount of the domestic stores in this new image, are you in fact seeing a difference in the trends at the reimage set versus the rest of the assets at all?\nPatrick Doyle\nYes. I think it\u2019s very consistent Brian with what we've said before is kind of what we're continuing to see which is an individual store getting reimaged will help the comp of that store by a point or two or three. When it gets done what is far more effective are important is the effect that it has on kind of maintaining overall momentum in the business and clearly with the comp growth that we're experiencing year-to-date were awfully pleased with the brand momentum.\nAnd we are continuing to see from that growth far more is coming out of order count growth than out of ticket. So this is about customers being excited about the experience that they're getting at Domino's and the reimaging of the stores clearly plays into that. So the individual effect on an individual store is relatively modest as we have said in the past. But we do believe that we are seeing in the results some of the overall effect of more and more of our system being reimaged.\nBrian Bittner\nOkay. And going back to the loyalty in the context of not what its impact is on the fourth quarter by any means, if you could just maybe just talk about it in general. How does the loyalty program that you've put in place exactly work for your customers? And maybe if you could just talk overall some things about this program that you are most excited about as you now put a loyalty program into the system?\nPatrick Doyle\nYes. What I'm really most excited about Brian is the simplistic of the program. So basically you get 10 points for every order of over $10 and when you 60 points, so effectively 10 orders you're getting a free medium pizza. It's very simple, six orders, yes, so it's very simple and customers understand this and we have seen how it can affect other brands. We've done a lot of research on this in designing it and obviously we're optimistic about it or we wouldn't have rolled out nationally.\nBrian Bittner\nGot it. And it\u2019s a type of -- so it\u2019s a type of program where you know exactly what you need to do to get to an award. It is not -- a reward. It is not a surprise factor situation like some other brands are doing?\nPatrick Doyle\nNo.\nBrian Bittner\nAnd it doesn't matter how large? Sorry.\nPatrick Doyle\nI'm going to say, one of things you learn from research on loyalty programs is they can get very complicated and you loss customers when they get too complicated and so this is very simple. Its transparent, people understand what they need to do. Fundamentally six orders over $10 gets you free medium pizza.\nBrian Bittner\nMake sense. All right. Thank you.\nPatrick Doyle\nThank you, Brian.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein\nGreat. Thank you very much. Two questions, maybe just first on the U.S. comp growth, it that looks like now we're talking about four consecutive quarters where you've actually done double-digit comp growth.\nPatrick Doyle\nWe are.\nJeffrey Bernstein\nAnd I know you don't offer much guidance, but I'm just wondering how you even think about growth from here, I mean, you mentioned the new national digital campaign which effectively started in 4Q in the loyalty program as well. But when you think about those comps going forward, I'm assuming like most of your peers the focus is more on the two and three-year trend to be fair and therefore, it would just seem like its hard to sustain that level of growth. And again I know you don't give guidance, but is it fair to say that you look at the two and three-year and you'd have a tough time from a capacity constrain perspective maintaining this type of double digit momentum?\nPatrick Doyle\nNo. The capacity constrains issues is simply upside for us. It's something that can be dealt with. I will tell you that the best day a franchisee has or we have in our corporate stores is we have so much volume coming in that we need to add another oven or a longer make line or something like that to handle that capacity. And I'll go back to the comments that I made about our franchisees and the system.\nOverall, I am just extremely pleased with how they are executing. At some point if the volume coming into the store is simply too much to handle with the size of the overall store than you got an opportunity to add another store. You're seeing that as part of the increase in that store growth and that too is a great day when you look at a store and say, my volume and as a result my profits coming from the store are extremely strong and I think its time to add another store to handle some existing territory. Those are incredibly high class problems.\nSo, look obviously we are really pleased with four quarters in a row of double-digit comps. And I would point out year-to-date our international business is north of 7% which if you look at our history going back 15 plus years that is as good that has been over that period of time as well and momentum is a power thing. So I guess what I would say is we wake up every morning and we're trying to figure out how do we sustain momentum and how do we keep the growth going in the business. We are never satisfied with the sales that we're getting. We always want more.\nWe never satisfied with the execution we have in the store, even though we're pleased with where we are. It's our job to continue to look for more opportunities to reduce friction points for customers and it's our job to keep momentum going. And so obviously I can't go into what's happening within quarters or expectations going forward except to say that we are extraordinarily focused on keeping that momentum going.\nJeffrey Bernstein\nNo. That's tremendous. I assumed you were going to acknowledge the year ago compares, but it seems like it\u2019s not necessarily just lapping at double-digit would imply you couldn't sustain this sequential momentum which is obviously a little more impressive.\nMy other question was just on the labor line, which I know it doesn't get a lot of question because you're primarily franchise system, but from the company operate side there was some significant pressure on the third quarter. I'm assuming that pressure is probably seen by the franchisees as well. I was wondering whether you won't had any quantitative data on the current or projected labor inflation percentages you're seeing or whether in conversations with franchisees there is feeling, an inclination of price more aggressively to offset since like some other franchise system are talking about franchisees getting more aggressive to mitigate what could be significant prolong labor inflation. So just wondering what your kind of sense of the franchise community?\nPatrick Doyle\nYes. So, on labor rates specifically around our company-owned store first, we saw a little bit of an uptake in that line. Some of it wage rate, some of it just higher bonuses as our performance in our corporate operations has been very good. On the franchisees side on balance we only have 375 corporate stores. I think the other 4800 or so are generally seeing kind of the same environment around wages. The other thing I'd say is kind of despite any wage inflation, we haven't seen a ton of wage inflation. I would say that our entrepreneur independent franchisees are going to manage through it.\nLast year when cheese was at in all time high they were able to put up their best ever on average unit economics in the 55-year history of the brand, we have a lot of great franchisees out there that really don't look for excuses, they are really just focused on managing and whether its food cost or labor line item they're going to managed through it, so we're not overly concerned about wages at the moment.\nJeff Lawrence\nAnd the one thing I would add to that is rough the statement from before which is we believe we're well on the way to the $100,000 of EBITDA for the average franchisee, so overall different line items may move around on the P&L, but overall at the end of the day what we're looking at the most and certainly what our franchisees are looking at the most is what is the bottom line and the bottom line looks so far materially better in 2015 than it did in 2014 and 2014 was a record year.\nJeffrey Bernstein\nAppreciate you easing those concerns. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Steve Anderson with Maxim Group.\nSteve Anderson\nGood morning. I have a couple of quick questions on foreign exchange. First wanted to ask was the impact of the foreign exchange in the third quarter known at the time of the pre-release? And wanted to ask why, if you didn't know why you weren't at liberty to discuss that. And I have a follow-up regarding guidance?\nJeff Lawrence\nYou know, on FX generally it\u2019s been a headwind for us, every quarter this year the run rate on a material basis really wasn't that different than we seen over the past 12 months, so its going to be $18 million to $20 million based on our current estimate about three quarters of that, now we're at two, three quarter at the year. We've taken, but again, I don't think any surprise that FX is a headwind for us or any other QSR with international operation. And when you look at the basket we've got a real nice diversified basket of currencies. It is just that we find ourselves in 2015 where the dollar has decided to strengthen against darn near every single one of them. Despite that headwind we remained proud what we're able to do on the bottom line and we'll monitor going forward, but I don't think the FX in Q3 was any different on a run rate basis than we'd expected.\nSteve Anderson\nAnd what gives you the confidence to not increase the high end of that guidance, I mean, do you see any signs of moderation going forward?\nJeff Lawrence\nWell, what we do, I mean, what we do is as far as our estimating process on FX is we basically subscribe to an independent kind of economist consensus around FX and we get all of the best thinking around where people think FX is going to go and that's how we drive our estimate. So we're not taking kind of our own personal view of the world or on FX market. We just think that you know it's been a headwind Q4 likely also to be headwind with the comment I made earlier that we expect this total tally in 2015 to be $18 million to $20 million. Again things can change, FX can change, but that's our best view over that at the moment.\nSteve Anderson\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe\nThank you. Can you hear me?\nPatrick Doyle\nYes.\nJohn Ivankoe\nOkay, good. I'm sorry; I'm in a hotel room. Just regarding the question on labor earlier, obviously there was kind of increase in your company store labor cost I think a lot of that was due to incentive compensation, and my questions are several. As or has been that significant move towards digital ordering, what have you done with the labor in the store? Have you continued to reallocate the order takers to pizza makers, which have actually added capacity to their stores? Have you heard from franchisees that they actually think that they might be able to reduce the number of labor hours in the stores?\nAnd as we hear about minimum wages, at least from what I remember in the past, your drivers were paid kind of a full minimum wage; in other words as a non-tipped employee versus a tipped employee. In markets where the minimum wage might go to $15 an hour, your delivery driver turns into an extremely well-paid position, which I guess is fine. But do you actually have an opportunity to maybe classify some drivers perhaps as tipped employees where the minimum wage impact might not be as significant for the franchisee? Thanks.\nPatrick Doyle\nYes. First of all, we do have some tip credit team members out there. And it's kind of a market by market decision. We're looking at what we need to pay to get great people in markets and that varies and obviously minimum wage varies, your ability to apply tipped credit and all varies state-by-state and sometimes city-by-city. And it various even more greatly with our franchisees who are making their own decisions on their compensation, and so, there is a lot of variation on that.\nAnd at the end of the day, we've got to pay at a level that's going to get us great team members and ultimately that's also going to include what their tips are going to be as drivers and that also varies market-to-market. And frankly as we look at their overall compensation we're taking into account kind of the level of average tipping in different markets, because we know that's going to be part of their decision, they're going to make whether or not they're going to work for us and what their total compensation picture is going to look like.\nIn terms of labor and digital and kind of efficiency in the stores, I will tell you that there is still inefficiency in the stores, there are still opportunity to get better and how we manage our labor, but we have enormous advantage in our platform with our know-how with digital to be able to run our stores efficiently. When we were first getting digital ordering going, I will tell you that we expected labor efficiency faster than we saw it. We didn't really start seeing a lot of labor efficiency in the stores until we got to kind of this 15% to 20% digital order range.\nWe were looking very carefully when we were kind of single digit 10% and we really, we had to look awfully hard to see it. And the reality is that you've got a fixed amount of labor in stores to cover shifts, to cover the basic functions in the store and when it was a relatively low level, our digital orders, your ability to offset labor was pretty minimal. As its gotten higher we started to see more impact from that and we're in the range now with digital sales around 50% that we clearly can see some savings in the store.\nWhat's maybe more important than that though is not just the labor savings, its kind of the overall profitability of digital orders. And what's most important on that is order comp growth. As customer experience the ability to drive frequency retention of those customers that ultimately what drivers better overall economics in the stores. Volume order counts, happy customers ultimately has more affect than labor savings or anything else. So, we believe given our the strength of our digital platform it puts us in certainly a better than average position to kind of manage kind of the overall cost structure, particularly if we see change in that going forward and we continue to make investments that hopefully we're going to continue to create even more competitive advantage around that.\nJohn Ivankoe\nThanks great. Thank you.\nPatrick Doyle\nThanks, John.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Mark Smith with Feltl and Company.\nMark Smith\nHi. Good morning, guys. Two quick ones. First, just looking at pricing, it looks like you had bit of an increase in ticket, but mostly traffic. Can you guys get more ticket or take price increases in today's kind of competitive environment?\nPatrick Doyle\nWe've some ticket and go back to the comments I made about Marbled Cookie Brownie. That helps getting ticket. Fundamentally you have two ways of doing it. You can sell more food or you can increase price. If you can get it by selling more food that's going to help the overall profitability of the order and it is also something not going to negatively impact the customer in any way. But I think my overall take is customers are smarter today, more careful about how they are spending their money post the downturn in 2008, 2009 and that hasn't changed.\nThey've got access to more pricing information. They are making smarter decisions and that's ultimately a great thing that helps us because we create great value. But in terms of is there significant pricing power for us, no, there is not. I don't think you can take aggressive price in this economy right now and not expect that\u2019s it\u2019s going to hit your order counts. So you know we do it very judiciously, when we can we try to take it by selling more food as opposed to directly increasing price, but you know both of those play in and the majority of the pricing decision is made locally by the store. They honor the national price point but the majority of the sales are being done off a local price points, local menu pricing, local coupons that are being chosen and that gives you an ability to adapt the kind of local market conditions both customer demand and the cost structure that\u2019s in place market by market.\nMark Smith\nAnd you spoke to my second question a little bit. When you do see a current order with dessert, is it typically incremental to the check or do customers cut a little bit out of their order to fit in that desert?\nAnd I guess just looking at marbled cookie brownie if you do move to marketing that, should we expect that to be purely incremental or will people cut something else out?\nPatrick Doyle\nYou know you hope for it to be as incremental as possible obviously and we wouldn\u2019t do it if it wasn\u2019t incremental. Can you see it cannibalizing a little bit?\nMark Smith\nSure.\nPatrick Doyle\nAnd you know and we have a terrific lave cakes and you would expect to see a little bit of it come out of the lava cakes. But we wouldn\u2019t do it if we didn\u2019t think that it was going to be largely incremental.\nMark Smith\nOkay, excellent. Thank you.\nPatrick Doyle\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of David Carlson with KeyBanc\nDavid Carlson\nHey thank you. I've got a couple questions for you guys and I appreciate you guys taking the question. Jeff, first on the commissary segment, I realize that $1.4 million of insurance claims was included in the costs during the quarter. But even when we adjust that out the supply chain segment profit was shy of our expectations and was about $1.7 million below the profit generated in the first two quarters of 2015.\nSo I know cheese prices were about $0.10 to $0.15 higher in the third quarter than they were in the first two quarters of 2015, which I mean in all honesty would have expected that to result in significantly higher revenue than what you guys reported. So really hoping you could discuss some of the moving pieces and parts of the supply chain and some of the factors that may be impacting profitability.\nJeff Lawrence\nYes, so on supply chain if you just look at the margin and you know supply chain margins $31 million for the third quarter. A year ago it was about $29 million, we obviously have a bunch of flow through from volumes you know most of our comp increases in the quarter and year-to-date have been from traffic as opposed to ticket. You do have the insurance charge as you mentioned. Other than that, you know it\u2019s not going to really material they are really fixed out to us, it was a little bit down as a percentage, the operating margin as a percentage of revenues, but again, we attribute that more to the insurance charge and anything. We are not seeing big big changes and things like you know labor rates or things like that. So really have nothing, nothing really incremental this year with \u2013 it\u2019s a good business for us. It\u2019s a good business for our franchisees, they get great product better than they can buy it anywhere else. And it\u2019s got a good ROI for the business, but other than that insurance charge really nothing else to point out.\nDavid Carlson\nOkay. And then I know you guys are -- I think my question on the loyalty program is probably a little bit more general and not necessarily specific to the fourth quarter. But can you guys discuss the plan to convert user profiles to loyalty members? Are you guys offering any incentives, let's say, anything like that, just any sort of information that you can provide?\nPatrick Doyle\nIt\u2019s really is all they have to do is click a box on their pizza profile. And so we make that as simple for them as we possibly can.\nDavid Carlson\nAnd you said 40% of the digital users include pizza profiles?\nPatrick Doyle\nCorrect.\nDavid Carlson\nOkay. And then just out of curiosity how much did the digital mix increase during the third quarter. I know this is the quarter you usually were supposed to start increasing once people go back to school etcetera?\nPatrick Doyle\nYeah except that you really see that in the fourth quarter, so still very consistent.\nDavid Carlson\nIt\u2019s around 50%.\nPatrick Doyle\nYep.\nDavid Carlson\nThank you, guys.\nPatrick Doyle\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Joseph Buckley with Bank of America.\nJoseph Buckley\nThank you. Couple of follow up questions. Just on the insurance charges will you be accruing at a higher level going forward about thinking about next year and maybe the out years?\nJeff Lawrence\nYes, so and as Patrick mentioned earlier we are all hands on deck on ensuring that the financial picture around insurance doesn't repeat itself as far as kind of this, this little blip we had. But more importantly it\u2019s about getting team members home safely. Our run rate going forward it will also largely be determined kind of by an actuarial estimate for the next fiscal year we expect that to be you know marginally up from our historical run rate just because of those the increase that we had earlier this year and some of the severity that we saw, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a materially higher run rate and again I think that again as Patrick mentioned to the extent that we are successful in managing through this I think we are going to get it down to the long term run rate over time.\nSo I don\u2019t expect it to be a material headwind for us or an increase really in 2016 maybe a little bit but again that will be kind of done with our independent actuary coming up in the next couple of months.\nJoseph Buckley\nGot it, thank you. And then a question on the supply center revenues. You mentioned equipment sales to franchisees as the reimages, remodels occur and I guess also maybe the new unit openings. Can you tell us what portion of the supply chain revenues that is and what is the margin on that, is that a profitable sale for you?\nPatrick Doyle\nYes, no its \u2013 so first of all we haven\u2019t broken out exactly what those sales are, but the answer is net of the people that we needed to add to manage this process of going through the reimaging and it will have no positive or negative effect on our bottom line P&L. So, you know what you kind of guess that is should you worry about whether or not as we finish the reimaging whether or not there will be a drop off in profits because we are no longer selling the equipment for the reimage as the answer is no. You shouldn\u2019t worry about that because net of the people we needed to add to manage through the process it has no positive or negative effect on our profitability.\nJoseph Buckley\nGot it. Thank you. And then Patrick, just a big picture question. We are seeing lots of companies; lots of brands announce delivery relationships. And not every business lends itself to delivery like the pizza business has. And it is in the genes of the business long term. But I am curious what you would think about this movement towards delivery, just broadly, and what maybe are some of the things that some of these companies or brands will have to deal with that is just a natural part of your business, but is going to be some new consideration on their side?\nPatrick Doyle\nYes well first clearly we are kind of the world leaders in real time delivery. We\u2019ve been doing it a long time, we are very efficient at it and we\u2019ve got a lot of system built up around that particularly operationally. And I guess what I would say is there are a lot of people who have gotten into the space. My understanding is that as it relates to moving packages and food, very few if any of them are today making money doing that. There are folks that are doing pretty well out there moving people around, but I think people are learning that you know moving packages around and the scale that you need to do that it\u2019s not easy.\nAnd you know there are real operational complexicities to it beyond kind of building the software platform to do it. So we are really good at it as people have tried to compete with us around the world in delivery I think they have found out overtime that it\u2019s operationally not as easy to operate as people may think and it has been a great source of advantage for us versus our competition both.\nWhat we are able to do with the digital platform and the scale of our business and the ability to spread those costs across the system has built a pretty effective competitive advantage for us as people have tried to get into physically moving food or packages around \u2013 I think they are finding that the economies or scale on that are pretty tough. So we watch it closely, and you know both domestically and around the world but we are pretty confident of our ability to do it awfully well and as you are aware we\u2019ve been investing heavily to continue to drive efficiencies for us in doing it.\nJoseph Buckley\nAnd, Patrick, another kind of big picture question, is the movement towards delivery of restaurant meals more advanced internationally? Yum! was talking about this yesterday with respect to its China business. And I am just kind of curious given your international footprint, and I know China is not a very critical market for you at this point, but if you seeing delivery outside the U.S. gaining traction faster?\nPatrick Doyle\nYeah, I think you know certainly if you look at China, you\u2019ve seen both KFC and McDonald\u2019s in major cities have done delivery. And you know that\u2019s still less common for them across their system than more common. So as China I think has done a little bit more at the forefront for those brands in moving the delivery. There's certainly lots of aggregators out there for kind of digital ordering and most of which are not as significant scale yet and then you\u2019ve \u2013 I think from kind of the delivery service side, there are certainly markets where that\u2019s moving faster than others but I don\u2019t know that I would say it\u2019s materially different in international than it is in the U.S. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s any more advanced in a lot of these markets than what we are seeing in the U.S. Our business in China \u2013 we\u2019re still under a 100 stores but we continue to be pleased with the progress we are making there but you know obviously it is still a relatively small business for us.\nJoseph Buckley\nThank you. I appreciate that perspective.\nPatrick Doyle\nThanks, Joe.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions in queue at this time.\nPatrick Doyle\nThank you everybody. I look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day in January as well as discussing our fourth quarter earnings and year-end results on February 25th.\nOperator\nThis does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Our Form 10-Q will be filed later today and that too will be available on our website once filed.\nPlease note, during this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, and industry and market conditions, and forward-looking statements related to the integration of the Aetna acquisition including the expected consumer benefits, financial projections, and synergies.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in the forward-looking statements.\nWe strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in this morning's earnings press release.\nDuring this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance and financial condition. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in this morning's earnings press release and the reconciliation document posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year following today's call.\nNow, I'll turn the call over to Larry Merlo. Larry?\nLarry Merlo\nThanks Joe. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Today I'm pleased to report that we are off to a strong start to the year as evidenced by our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.62 which exceeds our initial expectations. The strong performance was driven by all businesses achieving or exceeding what was contemplated at the high end of our guidance ranges with the Health Care Benefits segment leading the favorability.\nNow, earlier this year, we provided 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $6.68 to $6.88 and as a result of our Q1 performance, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $6.75 to $6.90. This reflects the positive momentum in the business, while acknowledging it's early in the year. We remain singularly focused on driving both near and longer term value for our shareholders.\nAnd our first full quarter as a combined entity with Aetna was a success on many fronts. We executed smooth January 1 implementations and both the Pharmacy Services and Health Care Benefits segments posted significant Medicare Advantage membership growth, continued to grow share in our Retail Pharmacy, and we realigned some of our operations to drive greater value.\nIn addition to highlighting these operational achievements, I'll provide updates on important operational initiatives that we called out during our fourth quarter call, progress on our integration and transformation initiatives, the 2020 PBM selling season, and potential policy changes impacting the Medicare Part D program.\nSo, let me start with the notable progress we made on actions to mitigate the near-term headwinds impacting our business. First, our retail sales momentum remains strong, supported by continued focus on our clinical care programs and network relationships.\nAdjusted prescription volume for the Retail/Long-Term Care segment increased a healthy 5.5% for the quarter. Additionally, our Long-Term Care business is on track to achieve our targeted margin improvements given our cost management efforts and we continue to work diligently in driving growth for the assisted living space.\nIn the PBM, our new guaranteed net cost pricing model continues to garner interest from clients and benefit consultants and will have a small number of clients adopting it this year and we expect higher adoption in 2020 and beyond.\nWe also embarked on a new effort to reduce costs across our enterprise through improvements in productivity and driving efficiencies across our operations. And Eva will provide details on that initiative shortly.\nMoving to our integration of the Aetna business. We are very pleased with the progress we have made. Currently, we are tracking to the higher end of the $300 million to $350 million synergy goal for 2019 and we are on our way to exceed our initial target of $750 million in 2020. And while the synergies are important, the CVS-Aetna combination is about bringing to market new approaches to health care delivery and management.\nIn our Houston HealthHUB stores, we are demonstrating our ability to bring more health care services into communities meeting people where they are. We are using our data and analytics capabilities to offer people the next best action to achieve their best health and in doing so driving down health care costs. Our vision is for these consumer experiences to be seamlessly connected across digital and clinical interactions resulting in elements of health becoming part of one's regular routine. The benefits of lower health care costs will have positive financial impacts throughout our enterprise\nThese new store formats illustrate how CVS Health is evolving and differentiating to address the changing health care landscape. And while it is early we are very encouraged by the initial results in our Houston stores. The various product and service offerings are performing at or above our expectations. And given these results we will expand the HealthHUB model to fill out the Houston market and we'll provide further details on our rollout strategy next month. But this is the first of many innovations we'll share with you at our Investor Day.\nMoving to the 2020 PBM selling season, our retention rate currently stands in the mid-90% excluding the impact of Centene. The 2020 selling season has been somewhat unusual with no single factor contributing to lower than expected retention. And importantly, our service levels and performance metrics remain at historically high levels and we expect to return to historical retention levels in future periods.\nAnd finally, let me discuss the role of rebates in Medicare Part D and how our Part D plans are preparing for the 2020 bid. And I want to begin by acknowledging the clarifying guidance that CMS issued for plan sponsors that bids should reflect current law and not the newly proposed rebate rule. That guidance also stated that there are a number of issues that need to be addressed before the rule can be finalized. And should a rebate will be implemented the CMS demonstration project provides plans protection from much of the risk in applying rebates at the point of sale.\nAdditionally, this demonstration project will allow the administration to evaluate in real time the potential impact to Part D members' premiums and to the actual costs that will be incurred by CMS. This is both a prudent step and an important analysis before such a significant change to the Part D program is made permanent. The demonstration project will allow the administration and the private sector to learn together and make adjustments to the Part D program over a more reasonable period of time. And we plan to participate in the demonstration project aided by the learnings from our Allure PDP product.\nAnd more broadly the renewed focus nationally on what the next phase of access to affordable quality health care will be has generated significant attention in recent weeks. This is an important discussion and we will continue to be an active participant. That said regardless of what shape and form the next stage of health care takes, we remain confident that the private sector will play an essential role in both shaping and executing that next stage. And importantly, we remain best positioned to create and capture new opportunities in this ever-evolving landscape through our local assets, our end-to-end health care offerings and our ability to drive engagement positively impacting consumer health.\nSo let me turn the call over to Eva to walk through the key items for the quarter and an update of our full year outlook.\nEva Boratto\nThanks, Larry and good morning, everyone. Consistent with prior quarters you can find a slide presentation posted to our website this morning that provides the details of our first quarter results and the financial statements changes we discussed back in February. First quarter results are reported on a comparable basis and the reconciliations to GAAP measures can be found in the press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our website. For non-GAAP, keep in mind that we are now excluding amortization of intangibles from our operating income numbers.\nI want to reiterate what Larry said. We exceeded the projections we laid out for this quarter and we're pleased with our 2019 results thus far. Our adjusted EPS was above the high end of our guidance range at $1.62 with all segments performing at or above our expectations and Health Care Benefits leading the way. Consolidated revenue grew 34.9% in Q1 2019 above the top end of our guidance range. This year-over-year increase was largely driven by a full quarter of managed care operation included this year versus last. Health Care Benefits which includes our SilverScript Medicare Part D business contributed $17.9 billion of revenue for the quarter.\nAdjusted consolidated operating income grew nearly 57%, primarily due to the addition of the Aetna business. The Health Care Benefits segment contributed $1.6 billion to adjusted operating income.\nIn the PBM, revenue increased 3.1% with adjusted claims up 2.8% versus Q1 of 2018, driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice. PBM adjusted operating income decreased 4.2% as operating margins contracted 20 basis points due to continued price compression and the Anthem investments. Additionally outstanding rebate guarantees as well as drug price inflation remained consistent with our original expectations.\nWe released our 2018 PBM cost drug trend report last month. The trends are a validation of the crucial role that we play in the health care system and the value that we provide to our clients and their members in keeping prescription drug costs affordable.\nCaremark was again successful in delivering on this goal through the use of our formulary and cost management tools. Last year unit costs for non-specialty medications decreased 4.2% for commercial clients, while we also held unit costs on specialty products to an increase of just 1.7%, despite even higher list price increases.\nUnit cost growth overall was only 1.2% with the total cost trend rising 3.3% due to increased utilization including improvements in adherence. And importantly, we were able to drive down the average out-of-pocket costs for plan members for the sixth year in a row helping patients stay adherent and improving overall health.\nIn Q1 the Retail/Long-Term Care segment performed better than expected. We delivered strong adjusted script growth with adjusted same-store script growth of 6.7% despite the weaker flu season. This was driven by the continued adoption of our Patient Care Programs collaborations with PBM and preferred status in a number of Medicare Part D networks.\nOur market share in Q1 stands at 26.2%. Additionally front store comps increased 0.4%, despite the shift of the Easter holiday to later in April which was approximately an 80 basis point headwind. As expected first quarter Retail/Long-Term Care adjusted operating income declined 18.9%.\nThe year-over-year decline was driven by factors we've previously discussed, including continued reimbursement pressure with fewer offsets; higher expenses reflecting the wrap of last year's investments using savings from tax reform; and year-over-year performance of our long-term care business. Additionally we incurred higher legal costs in the quarter.\nAs we have discussed before we are continuously looking for ways to optimize our asset portfolio. In doing so, we made the decision to close 46 underperforming retail pharmacy locations.\nWe reported a $135 million charge in the Retail/Long-Term Care segment in Q1 related to the store closures primarily representing the operating lease, right-of-use asset impairment charges. Consistent with our non-GAAP definition this charge is excluded from our non-GAAP metrics.\nAnd finally Health Care Benefits started off the year strong with revenue and adjusted operating profit ahead of our expectations. Underlying these results we grew to serve over 700,000 additional medical members in the quarter driven by strong Medicare Advantage and commercial ASC membership growth and the initiation of new Medicaid contracts in Kansas and Florida.\nOur total health MBR was 84% in the quarter, a good start to the year. The MBR reflects moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior year reserve development across all of our core products.\nAs a reminder, given the timing of the close of the Aetna merger, the year-over-year results are not comparable for our Health Care Benefits segment. Our days claims payable was 45 days for Q1 which is lower than historical Aetna results. This difference was driven by the inclusion of SilverScript's operations which lowered the metric by about 5 days given faster claims submission times.\nGoing below the adjusted operating income line, our interest expense and weighted average shares were in line with expectations with a slightly lower income tax provision.\nWe generated strong cash from operations this quarter of $1.9 billion. We repaid nearly $900 million of long-term debt in the quarter which includes $375 million of long-term notes that matured and $500 million of the term loan outstanding using available cash to reduce long-term debt and interest expense.\nIn the quarter, we also delivered more than $600 million to shareholders through dividends. It's important to note that our commercial paper balance was temporarily elevated at the end of the first quarter given timing of customer receipts.\nThat balance was fully paid-off on April 1. And since quarter-end, we have maintained an average commercial paper balance of less than $200 million. Taking all of this into account, since the close of the transaction we have repaid approximately $4 billion of debt.\nTurning to our 2019 guidance, as Larry said, we are raising the guidance range to account for favorable performance during the first quarter. This brings our full year adjusted EPS range to $6.75 to $6.90. We now expect consolidated full year 2019 revenue in the range of $251.2 billion to $254.4 billion, and adjusted operating income between $15 billion and $15.2 billion.\nFor the segments, we expect full year 2019 adjusted operating income in the Pharmacy Services segment to be in the range of $4.86 billion to $4.92 billion, the Retail/Long-Term Care segment in the range of $6.63 billion to $6.71 billion, and the Health Care Benefits segment in the range of $5.18 billion to $5.24 billion.\nOur outlook for each of the segments was updated given the outperformance in the first quarter. The factors affecting the year have not materially changed from what I discussed back in February, which are summarized in the slides we posted on our website this morning. Recall that both the deal synergies and the incremental investments are expected to disproportionately affect the Health Care Benefits segment.\nAs Larry said, we are tracking to the higher end of the synergy range for this year and are on track to exceed our target of $750 million in 2020. These synergies will stem from the elimination of duplicative corporate and operational functions, purchasing efficiencies and some medical cost savings including formulary alignment.\nAs we discussed on our February call, we are also making investments to achieve our longer-term goals. These investments center on digital enhancements and the development of new programs to accelerate growth.\nWe continue to expect incremental investment spending to be between $325 million and $350 million in 2019. In addition, we also continue to expect integration costs of approximately $550 million, which are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance metrics.\nOur cash flows are expected to remain strong this year delivering between $9.8 billion and $10.3 billion of cash flow from operations, of which we expect $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion to be available for debt repayment this year. In addition to paying down our 2019 maturity, we plan to pay down the rest of our term loan by year-end.\nThe cash from operations will be reduced by net capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and shareholder dividends of approximately $2.6 billion, after increased retained capital needs for our insurance subsidiaries commensurate with our strong year-to-date membership growth in the Health Care Benefits segment, particularly in the government space.\nAs I stated, we expect to have $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion available for debt pay down in 2019. We are laser-focused on improving the cash generated by our business. And as we have discussed previously, we are working on a number of initiatives to further improve our cash generation which would yield upside to our current projections.\nTurning to operating efficiencies, both CVS and Aetna have had a strong history of executing successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives. And through our integration, we are seeing the opportunity to make productivity gains across the enterprise. We have consolidated various programs across the enterprise into one enterprise modernization initiative.\nWe expect the savings and productivity gains this initiative generates to help offset the competitive dynamics we are experiencing, drive the creation of more affordable products for our customers, and provide capacity that will help us achieve our financial targets as we continue investing in our strategic and transformational initiative.\nWe are confident that this initiative will help drive longer-term growth in the combined business beyond 2019. We expect this initiative to generate run rate savings of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in 2022, and this is over and above our deal synergy targets.\nFinally, I want to touch on expectations for earnings progression for the rest of the year. Year-over-year growth of consolidated adjusted operating income will be highest through the first three quarters as we wrap the addition of Aetna.\nWe expect to see adjusted operating income growth in our Retail/Long-Term Care and PBM segments improving as we move throughout the year. Adjusted operating income within Health Care Benefits is expected to be greatest in Q1 and lowest in Q4. For Q2, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.72.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Larry.\nLarry Merlo\nThanks, Eva. We are pleased with the progress and momentum we demonstrated in the quarter as we position ourselves to win in this evolving health care landscape. The breadth of our assets capabilities and experience meaningfully differentiate us from others in the market and provide us unique opportunities to create a company that generates superior value for shareholders and all the constituencies we serve. Next month, we plan on sharing our long-term targets including more specific details on the innovative products and services we plan to bring to market to achieve those goals as well as our earnings, cash flows and debt targets. And we look forward to seeing many of you in New York City on June 4.\nSo with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nLisa Gill\nThanks very much and congratulations on the first combined quarter. Larry, let me start with the selling season. I know you said that, there wasn't anything specific to the losses that you've seen thus far for 2020. But if I look at, at least what The Street knows about it looks like they're primarily coming on the health plan side. So do you think that now that you own Aetna that's playing anything into those decisions around health plans doing business with CVS? That would be my first question.\nAnd then secondly, as we think about that health plan business as it relates to your retail business can you just talk about utilization as far as script goes? Do you \u2013 are you seeing a lot of those scripts coming through CVS? Or will we see a combined loss of both of those going into 2020?\nLarry Merlo\nYeah, Lisa, good morning, and I'll take the first part of the question. Lisa, what's interesting is we've just had our Caremark Client Forum a few weeks back. Several of us were there. We spent time with the broader audience as well as our advisory groups, which we have that for each discipline within Caremark. And I would describe the health plans as having an ongoing tremendous amount of interest in terms of what it is that we're doing around transformation and interest in terms of how that can create value for them. So I did not get any sense whatsoever that this notion of channel conflict is entering into the selling season or entering in as a concern. And actually, quite the opposite, wanting to understand where we're at with the transformation and when and how they can benefit from those innovative products and services.\nEva Boratto\nAnd Lisa, this is Eva. On your second part of your question I would say, as you know our retail business has worked very strong over the last couple of years to improve our relationships, with other payers and have constructive network offerings. So we'll continue to work on and develop those relationships and don't see anything meaningfully step back there.\nLisa Gill\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore. Your line is open.\nRoss Muken\nGood morning, guys. Congrats. So I guess maybe on the retail side, I mean, it seems like the HealthHUBs and I recently saw one myself down in Houston are pretty impressive new institutions. I'm trying to get a sense \u2013 and I don't want to steal too much from the Analyst Day, but just in terms of the progress you've made there and the feedback the sort of loop of figuring out what models work what don't the sort of traffic uptick. So I guess when \u2013 maybe less on sort of anything numerical, but when do you think you'll be able to give us sort of updates on rollout sell-through to sort of the Aetna member base other creative sort of solutions you can come up with if any on the Medicaid side? Just a better sense of how that sort of plan is going to evolve and then how you're able to sort of incorporate that with some of the other omnichannel things you're doing as well as some of the front-end refresh overall?\nLarry Merlo\nYea, Ross, it's Larry. Great question and I'll take the first part and then I'll ask Kevin to comment perhaps to your point about \u2013 it's difficult to talk quantitatively at this point because we still have a limited amount of time, but I'll ask Kevin to talk qualitatively in terms of what we're seeing, what we're hearing from those that we're serving. Ross, I would describe where we're at today as we got more things right in our concept of what a HealthHUB is then things that we missed. And there are some things that we're tweaking, but as you heard in our prepared remarks, we're ready to complete the Houston market in the coming weeks. And to your other question, we will have a more detailed view of the rollout strategy beyond Houston as it relates to this year as well as 2020. So bottom line as you heard in our remarks we are excited about the opportunity.\nKevin Hourican\nYes, Larry. And I \u2013 sorry, It's Kevin. I appreciate the question. We call it creating a compelling place to shop, a reason for the consumer to want to come into the store. And that HealthHUB format is achieving that objective. The consumer reaction has been quite strong.\nWe've added thousands of net new items to the front store in the self-care and wellness arena, expanded MinuteClinic services. We've expanded the pharmacists' interactions with patients with greatest needs.\nAnd last but not least, we're really intrigued by the addition of a new position in our store called the care concierge, which is the glue that's kind of pulling together these ecosystems that can help answer consumers' questions about any and all health care needs that they have, including health care benefits in partnership with Aetna and other health plans in the future.\nAnd as Larry said at our Analyst Day, we'll talk in more detail about the expansion plans. We're working aggressively on that as we speak and can share those details on June 4.\nLarry Merlo\nRoss, the -- maybe just wrapping up this topic. One of the things that we are learning, that I know is of interest is, out of the gate we've talked about our hub-and-spoke concept. So if you look at what does it take to complete the Houston market, we needed about another 20 stores, which would represent about 15% of the stores in that metroplex, if you will.\nSo we are learning how to build out this hub-and-spoke concept, acknowledging that there are things that we're learning in these stores that we will apply broadly to the stores that aren't hubs in the market. And again, as Kevin mentioned, we'll talk more about that at -- on June 4. But again, the things that we are measuring, the metrics that we're using internally, we're very pleased. They're all meeting the objective or ahead of our target.\nKevin Hourican\nSo just last comment. This is Kevin, again. You asked about omnichannel. We recently announced that we expanded home delivery same day to over 6,000 stores in partnership with Shipt and we're pleased to see consumer adoption to even more convenient home delivery.\nRoss Muken\nAnd, I guess, maybe on the benefits business, I mean, it seems like you've done, obviously, quite well coming into this year on membership. You had momentum there. As you think about other types of places to integrate the asset base and maybe deeply tie in also, sort of, what you're doing on Caremark.\nI guess, is there anything like anecdotal, as you've integrated and as you've sort of game-planned, again, maybe at a very high level and you'll share more detail at the Analyst Day, but things where, well, we wouldn't have thought we can do that, or an area of focus where you think you can really sort of move the needle, as you start to laser in on maybe some of these bigger cost opportunities that exist within that sort of cost base?\nLarry Merlo\nWell, Ross, two points on -- to that question. Kevin mentioned the care concierge. And we're gaining a tremendous amount of learnings in terms of what exactly our customers are looking for, based on the interactions this position is having with them. And it covers a wide range of topics.\nI think the second thing is, there is certainly a lot more that we can do around specialty, based on some of the things that we're seeing and learning. And the third thing, Ross, that I would mention is that, we've got -- you've seen one of the concept stores, but as you think about the various segments that we serve, we could see a HealthHUB that is modified from what you may have seen in Texas, that would play to that segment of beneficiaries, but recognizing that they have different needs than what we may see more broadly in a market. So those are some things that we're working on as well.\nRoss Muken\nThanks, Larry. Appreciate the commentary.\nLarry Merlo\nThanks, Ross.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nAna Gupte\nYes. Hey, thanks. Good morning. Glad that you had a good quarter. I wanted to get some color on what the potential would be for growth in 2020. And I, obviously, am not looking for guidance or anything. But if you take a look at your synergy guidance, which you're saying confidently, is above $750 million and it sounds like there's some enterprise savings building on top of Aetna.\nThe Anthem story should become positive, offsetting some of the standard G&A pressures. And even though you have Centene, maybe, they kind of cancel out, maybe net positive. The PBM brand inflation guarantee sounds like that is tapering off and the Omnicare headwind should get better.\nSo when I look at the headwinds offsetting that that could be retail margin pressure, PBM margin pressure. But on balance, where do you see -- I mean, do you think around this close to $7 EPS handle now in 2019, you can go into 2020?\nLarry Merlo\nYes. Ana, it's Larry and first I -- we appreciate the question. And as you were just ticking off, there are certainly a lot of moving parts as it relates to 2020. And as you heard in our prepared remarks, the point of today's discussion, in light of Investor Day that is a month away, is really to zero in on our Q1 results, our outlook for 2019.\nWe understand and appreciate the questions that are out there beyond 2019 and I can assure you that next month we'll share our near or long-term targets including the details on how we achieve those targets on June 4th.\nAna Gupte\nOkay. Then maybe just if I can ask on the quarter and follow-up on the margins in retail. I mean, you've come now in line. You've exceeded your original guidance at least on the revenue. And then on the PBM margins, how do you see that shaping up for the industry as a whole into the selling season for the PBM? And in retail with your ability to steer Aetna into your CVS network, does that give you an edge that can offset some of the secular pressures?\nEva Boratto \nHi, Ana. This is Eva. I'll try to break apart your questions there. Overall for both of the legacy businesses retail and PBM, our margins, our performance came in at or better than expected. And some of the headwinds that we outlined, whether it was inflation the rebate guarantees, some of the challenges with long-term care, we performed certainly within our expectation.\nAs we said, longer-term, as we think about the store right moving toward providing more services and greater opportunities, higher value, we see those as the opportunities to improve our margins and our performance in that business.\nAna Gupte\nGreat. Thanks for the question. Good luck in the quarter.\nEva Boratto \nThanks Ana.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser\nYeah. Hi. Good morning. And congrats for a good start for the year. My question is around the cost savings that you identified $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Should we think about these as net cost savings or gross? And how should we think about the cadence to 2022? And are most of these cost savings coming from the retail segment? Or are they more broadly achievable throughout the enterprise?\nJon Roberts\nSo Ricky, this is Jon. So yes, this modernization effort that we're talking about is -- it's a transformative program that's comprised of initiatives including the work already underway for integration, the business unit productivity programs that we traditionally work on, and then initiatives that are enterprise-wide as our companies have come together. And we're calling that long-term value or LTV initiatives.\nAnd there's four core pillars of this program, and I'll just give you a couple of examples. First is, we want to share simplicity and at the same time deliver cost -- substantial cost benefits, and we want to do that while improving our consumer experiences.\nSo within that broader effort, these enterprise initiatives take advantage of the combined company's unique capabilities and assets, while helping us accelerate our savings goals. So some examples of these opportunities include call centers, digitalization of shared services, demand management and rationalization of our IT infrastructure. So this is a multi-year effort. These are net savings numbers. And we'll talk more specifically about this at our Analyst Day on June 4th.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nJoe Krocheski \nRalph.\nRalph Giacobbe\nSorry about that. Yes. Thanks for the question. You called out a favorable prior year and specifically 4Q and then provider recoveries. I was just wondering what the provider recoveries relate to the size of those and over what period of time? Thanks.\nEva Boratto\nHi, Ralph. This is Eva. In terms of the prior period development consistent with Aetna legacy practices there was no prior period development included in our guidance. Overall, we experienced favorable development across all of the core businesses as I said in the prepared remarks. And from a magnitude perspective, you can think about it as consistent year-on-year with development last year.\nWas there another question Ralph? In terms of I think your question also maybe around the settlement with HCA that was taken into account in some of our initial accounting with the acquisition and is not reflected in our results.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes\nHi. Good morning. So since last earnings I think the question I get most from investors is on the retail operating profit. Walgreens reported obviously since you reported and they had similar results. And a lot of investors ask me, if this is the new norm. So can you just talk about what you think can happen in the market or what headwinds will ease over the next couple of years to stabilize the operating profit trajectory of this business? Thanks.\nEva Boratto\nHi, Ann. It's Eva. I'll start and Kevin will jump in, in terms of longer term. As you look at our Q1 results, the headwinds are very consistent with what we described as we provided our guidance. Over half of the contraction was attributable to the tax reform investments, our long-term care as well as the incremental tax expense that we cited in this quarter. As you think about the tax reform investments those subside.\nWe are -- those are completed and in the run rate as we get to the back part of the year. We do expect Omnicare performance to improve as we go forward and we do expect generics to improve next year in the near term, although won't be a tailwind as you think about longer term. And we continue to see opportunities to drive services in our stores and increase products as an opportunity to mitigate the traditional headwinds.\nKevin Hourican\nAnd Eva Kevin -- thank you. This is Kevin. I'll just build on that on the longer term. We will talk about this more on June 4. But if you think about the opportunities to improve profitability in the upcoming years think about it in a five-part plan. First is drive industry-leading comp store script growth through our clinical adherence programs and increased medication adherence in script drug. Second is cost of goods sold improvement through Red Oak Sourcing.\nThird is to improve retail productivity through automation and process improvement. Fourth as we talked about briefly on the last call, a new contracting approach that aligns our incentives for reimbursement through lower overall Medicare costs and sharing those savings. And lastly, we're seeing optimistic things in our front store business through health and beauty, sales and profit growth that are drawing more customers into our store.\nEva Boratto\nAnd I'll just wrap up with one more thing. Obviously the costs the enterprise modernization initiative that Jon spoke to will benefit all aspects of our business.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake\nThanks. Good morning. First just last quarter you gave us some color on rebate guarantees. Wanted to come back to that just in terms of I think there was a little confusion around whether -- or do rebate guarantees actually get better year-over-year? I know eventually they'll unwind and you'll renegotiate these contracts with less guarantees in them. But does it get better next year meaning positive year-over-year? Or is it just less negative year-over-year?\nDerica Rice\nJustin. Hi, Justin, this is Derica. What we stated was that the rebate exposure will peak in 2019 and then that exposure will begin to dissipate over the ensuing years. So we expect that exposure to get less in 2020 and 2021. And so far this year, it's pretty well within our expectations that we laid out within our guidance.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.\nSteven Valiquette\nThanks. Good morning, Larry and Eva. So maybe somewhat similar to a couple of the other questions. For the PBM business, just given all the discussion around rebate minimum guarantees, cost guarantees et cetera I was kind of curious at a high level just around the Anthem customer contract. Without getting any numbers just qualitatively only does CVS already have strong visibility internally on what the profit contribution is likely to be from this contract in 2020? Or conversely, just given all of the discussion around guarantees that are baked into many contracts now, could there still be high volatility either up or down for CVS' profits from this large contract in 2020? Thanks.\nDerica Rice\nHi. This is Derica again. That's a great question. We appreciate it. When we provided our color commentary regarding rebate guarantees and our exposure that included Anthem as well. So when I talked about it our exposure peaking in 2019 and then subsiding in ensuing years that factored in our Anthem contract as well.\nLarry Merlo\nThe other thing Steve to keep in mind and I think you heard this on Anthem's call last week that the vast majority of that conversion takes place in the second half of this year to include the Medicare business converting on 1/1/20.\nEva Boratto\nAnd Steve the only additional piece I'll add on that as you think about when we onboard large health plans, the margins tend to be thinner earlier in the contract period as we execute on our programs and initiatives to drive improvements in the overall margins and profitability.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRobert Jones\nGreat. Thanks for the questions. I guess just two quick ones, one on the PBM side. Of the $47 billion I think you guys highlighted that was up for renewal this year, how much is left to still be renewed? And then just on the Aetna side of the business I'm curious if you would just share how the performance would have compared to internal expectations, if not for the prior period development in the quarter? Thanks.\nLarry Merlo\nBob, it's Larry. I'll take the first part. And Bob, we had said we have $47 billion up for renewal. We're just over halfway through the renewal season. It's pretty consistent with where we would have been at this point in time with prior years.\nEva Boratto\nAnd in terms of Aetna overall, underlying, the business performed well, including the prior period development. It's early in the year. We -- recall, we onboard a lot of new memberships, so we're monitoring that claim activity very, very closely. But I would say on all fronts, we're pleased with Aetna's performance.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nGlen Santangelo\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. Larry, just wanted to shift gears a little bit and go back to the Retail/Long-Term Care segment. Your scripts in that segment were up 5.5%, which is a little bit stronger than expected, particularly given we had a weaker-than-expected flu season. And so, I'm kind of curious if you could dive into that a little bit more and give us a sense for maybe what drove that trend.\nI'm guessing it's kind of too early that it's related to the benefits from the acquisition, but anything you can give us on the sustainability of that trend and what drove that will be helpful. Thanks.\nKevin Hourican\nThis is Kevin. It's a good -- appreciate the question. Think about our script growth coming from three components. One is network relationships the third-party payer contracts which are contributing to growth. The second is organic growth through our clinical adherence programs. So by keeping a patient adherent to their medication therapy, it helps them on their path to better health and it drives our business. We're doing very well on those clinical programs and we see sustainability of that growth. \nAnd then the third piece would be new services. We've introduced some compelling new unique services like our Saving Patients Money program, multi-dose packaging and home delivery, as I spoke to earlier. And we're seeing some nice growth in those newer services that we've brought to the market.\nOperator\nYour next question \u2026\nLarry Merlo\nI was just going to say, Glen, we see those in terms of being foundational and not episodic in nature.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open.\nCharles Rhyee\nYeah. Thanks for taking question. Just staying with the Retail segment for a second here. One of your competitors on their call a couple of weeks ago kind of cited generic deflation or the moderating effect of generic deflation as a factor in some of their results. I haven't really heard you guys talk about that. Can you talk about sort of the -- what you're seeing in terms of moderating generic deflation? Because it looks like that trend has been continuing to moderate through March. And how are you kind of thinking about the environment here as we move forward for that?\nAnd is that -- and I guess related to that is that already baked into your guidance when you talked about sort of you look at the 10% down with half of it being from -- partly from generics. My assumption had -- my thought had been that you would really be referring more to the prevalence of the break-open generics and not necessarily generic deflation. If you could just provide some color on that, that would be great. Thanks.\nEva Boratto\nYeah. This -- Charles, this is Eva. In terms of what we're seeing as it pertains to generics, it is all included in our guidance. And as we outlined back in February, what we're seeing is overall fewer opportunities with break-open generics this year. It is a lighter year relative to the prior years than what we've seen and we see it improving in 2020.\nJon Roberts\nAnd then Charles, the only thing I would add is -- you've heard a lot of talk about the improvements in the FDA process that allows suppliers to more rapidly get to the market. That gives us more flexibility. And so, we are seeing less opportunity in 2019 as Eva said, but we think Red Oak continues to deliver value for us -- significant value for us and we expect that to be even better as we move forward.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice\nHi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Obviously, the last few years one of the bright spots for Aetna was the growth in MA. And as it's come on board with you guys, Medicare Advantage enrollments accelerated. I wonder if you could just parse out a little bit how you're seeing that growth this year. Is that expanding geographies which was part of the story the last few years? Or is it market share gains?\nAnd I know the rule of thumb on Medicare Advantage. In the first year those members typically come on at sort of a breakeven level. Is that what you're assuming? Or is there any reason to think you guys might be able to bring them on more profitably or not?\nKaren Lynch\nHi, A.J. It's Karen. I would characterize our Medicare Advantage growth coming from a number of places. One, yes, our services area expansion has generated a fair amount of growth for us. But I would also say that we are continuing to grow in our existing footprint and that our same-store growth has generated good Medicare Advantage growth for us.\nI would also tell you our continued excellence in Star is helping the performance of this product. And we've also been strengthening our clinical management activities, which I think has been resonating in the marketplace.\nI would also look to the product and product flexibility and our zero-premium plan which has allowed us to grow this year as well. And then we have been very strongly managing our distribution channels. And I would say it's the combination of all those factors that are really driving it. Relative to the margin what I would say is, we are tracking in line with our expectations. We typically expect to see lower margins on first year business, but there's nothing in our metrics that give us any pause for any deterioration. And I would just say that we're in line with what we expected on margins.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Percher from Nephron. Your line is open.\nEric Percher\nThank you, Eric Percher and Josh Raskin from Nephron. Larry, you sound more constructive on the safe harbor proposal after the CMS guidance and the demo announcement. Obviously, there is a lot of potential unintended consequences. As we looked at your comments there was a comment toward the end around disallowing of pharmacy purchase discounts which would appear to impact you as a buyer and dispensing pharmacy. So I wanted to ask is that material in your view? And what action do you take to try to offset that if it occurs?\nLarry Merlo \nWell, Eric let me make sure I'm following your question because as we have talked about rebates, we have always provided an all-in number as it relates to rebates. And so we don't see any issues there or misalignments. If I'm following your question what we have talked about is we see rebates as a form of discounting. And we can get into a lot of discussion around how that has brought the net price of pharmaceuticals down for the clients and members that we serve. And if you look at rebates as discounts what we emphasize is through the private sector there has been a lot of good things happen in that regard. And rebates can take some other form, but we must make sure that the private sector competition that results from that that drives down price that the ability to -- for that to continue in the form of some type of discounts doesn't go away.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo\nHi. Good morning. One quick question on the prior year development. I just -- I know it wasn't contemplated in the original guidance, but in the updated guidance is there any incremental prior year development built into those numbers? That was the first one. And then the second one on the PBM side historically when we've seen companies with low retention a lot of times they've been able to offset some of the losses by dipping down into the mid-market and maybe taking some share there. Is there a similar strategy or something you can do to offset the headwinds for 2020 on the PBM side strategically?\nEva Boratto\nSo I'll take the first question, Kevin regarding prior period development. The only thing that is reflected in the numbers we presented today was the prior period development realized in Q1. No projections go forward consistent with our initial guide and legacy Aetna practices.\nA \u2013 Larry Merlo\nAnd Kevin, it's Larry. In terms of the second question \u2013 Kevin, while we provided an update on the selling season as it stands today obviously there's still a lot of runway remaining for the 2020 selling season. And we'll continue to provide updates. So we still have a long way to go before we complete the season.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nPeter Costa\nGood morning. Question on the Health Care Benefits business and your maintained guidance on medical benefits ratio of 84%. Given the favorable prior period development, you'd think you'd be sort of on the lower end of that range at this point in time. Can you -- would you say that you're at the lower end of the range at this point? Or do you think really it's the full range that you're thinking about? And then will you not have the seasonal pattern that Aetna typically had which was a rising medical loss ratio through the year because of all the deal synergies?\nEva Boratto\nHi, Peter. It's Eva. It's early in the year, so we provided the range and we'll stick with that range. Obviously as we progress throughout the year we'll provide additional updates. There was a lot of membership growth as Karen cited which we'll continue to monitor their utilization. In terms of the progression throughout the year, as we stated we moved SilverScript over to the Health Care Benefits segment which carries a different quarterly pattern than the traditional Aetna pattern where on the SilverScript it's highest in the first quarter and reduces as you go throughout the year given the risk corridor sharing. So that's a key driver of why you see maybe a little bit of a higher-than-expected Q1 MBR.\nA \u2013 Larry Merlo\nI think we have time for two more questions.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Michael Cherny\nHi, thanks for taking the question. Larry, I want to go back to a comment you made earlier regarding your recent PBM user meeting and the conversations you were having with health plans and the engagement level. I guess as they think about what you're becoming as an integrated entity now that you own Aetna, what are they looking for you, the new CVS qualitatively to provide for them? And that engagement push is there a realization or understanding of what you're doing with the store base and with the HealthHUB initial push that can help them drive potential value going forward?\nA \u2013 Larry Merlo\nYes Mike. First of all we -- as part of that meeting, we did provide an update as to the work today to include the HealthHUBs. And I would say that there's a growing realization that if we describe this as consumerism in health care is here to stay. So the fact that we have these customer-facing assets is I think what is gaining a lot of interest and attention in terms of what that potentially can mean. And it reflects some of our earlier discussions, some of the points that Kevin made that as you think about -- if I just focused on the bricks-and-mortar retail store for a minute that we're beginning to see this evolution through the HealthHUBs of it's not just selling thousands of products. It's a combination of products and services that the dynamic in health care at some point, even though, we're seeing more and more health care in the palm of your hand and that's an important part of our strategy, at some point that consumer has to be touched. And we have the unique way to do that in a surround-sound way.\nOperator\nYour last question comes from the line of Hima Inguva from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Hima Inguva\nThank you. Congrats on a good quarter. Eva just wanted a little bit of clarification on the pace and cadence of delevering that you expect. Maybe if you could share the timing on when you see getting to the three times leverage target and then also any color on your recent conversations with the credit rating agencies would be great. Thank you.\nA \u2013 Eva Boratto\nYes. Thanks for the question, Hima. As we said consistently, our top priority is to deleveraging get to our low three times rating. We're pleased with our paying down the term loan early, $500 million we paid in Q1 and we expect to pay that full term loan down by the end of the year. And at this point, I -- we're not going to provide our longer-term leverage road map there. We'll provide that at Analyst Day.\nThat said, as we continue to look for opportunities to generate cash to pay down this debt and we're working on initiatives on working -- improving working capital, a full review of our portfolio as well as the cost initiatives that Jon spoke about, we believe, in addition to driving growth in our business will enable us to continue to improve our leverage.\nLarry Merlo\nSo just wrapping up here, there were a lot of questions. We appreciate all the questions. We're trying to track to make sure we've answered everything, recognizing there were multiple pieces to questions. One of the things that I do want to clarify, I think Ricky had asked the question about the enterprise modernization, the cost reduction, were the numbers gross or net. And we want to be clear that those numbers that Eva provided were after any expenses incurred to execute that. So those were net improvement numbers. And listen obviously Joe and his team are available for follow-up. And we look forward to hopefully seeing all of you on June 4.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\n\n",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.\nKathleen Nemeth\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here on the call are Shaygan Kheradpir, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer. Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Platform Systems Division, will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nPlease remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry; changes in overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and major customers; the network capacity requirements of service providers; the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products; rapid technological and market change; litigation; the potential impact of activities related to the execution of Juniper's integrated operating plan; and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q and the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call.\nIn discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website.\nOn today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded for non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Shaygan.\nShaygan Kheradpir\nThank you, Kathleen, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to be here on my 23rd day at the company and on my first quarterly conference call with you. It's an honor to be selected as Chief Executive Officer of Juniper and to lead the company at this exciting time.\nMy first 3 weeks have been busy. I have and will continue to engage with our customers, employees, investors and other key stakeholders. I am actively reviewing the company's business lines, operating model and capital structure. We are building up a strong base. We delivered record revenue this quarter, good growth on year-over-year basis and a strong book-to-bill. And I continue to see substantial opportunities for Juniper to grow and deliver value. As you will hear shortly, my initial priorities are centered around developing an integrated operating plan, which is focused on profitable growth and shareholder value creation. I will present the details of this plan to you more fully in a few weeks.\nBefore I hand it to Robyn, I want to share with you why I made the decision to join Juniper and provide some insight into my and my team's initial priorities. First, I see a great opportunity with an iconic and pioneering company that has phenomenal assets, technology and people that can address our customers' most pressing requirements. Juniper uniquely leverages its strength in systems, silicon and software to build the kind of networks that fits where our customers want to be and importantly, where the market is evolving to: high performance, agile, secure, automated, context aware networks in an open framework. I know this because I've been in this industry for 27 years as a customer, in both the service provider and enterprise sectors. I understand intimately their environments and imperatives for new revenue growth, speed-to-market, service quality, operational and capital efficiency and how to put Juniper's portfolio to work in powerful ways that matters to customers.\nTo achieve this, Juniper needs to be the leading provider of high-IQ networks and best-in-class cloud builder, where the network is the most sensitive piece of the puzzle and has to be the first mover. I intend to play an active role in guiding this transition. But I'm also here as an agent of change. Specifically, I believe I can leverage my operational experience, as well as my deep engineering and technology background to drive effective and efficient business operations and lead Juniper through the changes required to reach its full potential. In short, this is an outstanding platform for which to deliver a great customer value proposition and substantial shareholder value.\nSince arriving at Juniper, I've been interacting with the key stakeholders and analyzing our revenue streams, including what customers are buying and for what use cases. This information reaffirms my view of where the markets are headed and where Juniper has the most significant competitive advantage. I can see our heritage, secure, high-performance networking, open architectures and deep engineering talent, converging with this future. This, I believe, will position Juniper as a world-class provider of innovative, high-IQ networks and cloud builder across our customer base. This includes not only our strong base of service providers and public sectors customers, but also newer customer segments such as Web 2.0, cable, content and financial services, as well as other customers who all want clouds and high-IQ networks.\nI also recognize that we have work to do. So my team and I are already hard at work, developing an integrated operating plan that addresses 3 key priorities. Firstly, we are tailoring our strategy to focus on innovation that matters to our customers and where we excel, bringing in the outside in customer imperatives. I intend to restore Juniper's focus on thoughtful, highly value accretive innovation and rebuild the get-it-done culture that unleashes the talent of our people. Additionally, we will implement a more efficient cost structure, commensurate with our strategic focus and the competitive environment, resulting in reduced costs. I'll be taking a three-pronged approach: focused R&D that matters, radical simplification on automation and rightsizing. We will do this in a smart way, with an eye towards returns on investment and focusing on the cost drivers, such as operational leading indicators. This is something I've done before and I'm confident can be effectively implemented at Juniper. Lastly, we've been taking an in-depth look at our future cash flows and capital structure to assess how we can best return capital to shareholders, while still maintaining the financial flexibility to invest for future growth. We're actively evaluating the capital return policy, which includes level of share repurchases and dividends.\nWhile the company has been working on the areas of cost structure and capital return for some time, since I've joined the team and I have been full-on, on strategy, cost structure and capital return and we resolve to deliver meaningful results in this area. We will do this with an emphasis on disciplined execution on business fundamentals. I look forward to announcing and sharing with you the details of our integrated operating plan in the next few weeks. You have my commitment that the plan we present to you will be well considered, specific and achievable. I also look forward to spending additional time with our shareholders and analysts in the coming weeks. And as we have said previously, we are very interested to continuing a constructive and open dialogue with our shareholders. I've been talking about what I've been doing and will continue to do in the next few weeks. As I indicated, Juniper had a strong Q4.\nAnd I now hand it to Robyn to take you through the details.\nRobyn M. Denholm\nThank you, Shaygan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our Q4 2013 results reflect strong sequential and year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. We had a record revenue quarter, driven by strength in both service provider and enterprise. Non-GAAP earnings increased sequentially due to higher revenues, partially offset by high variable operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, we completed the restructuring actions that we announced 90 days ago. We have been comprehensively analyzing our cost structure in the context of our strategy and, as noted by Shaygan, we will provide additional details on our integrated operating plans in the coming weeks.\nLooking at our demand metrics, we had a very strong bookings quarter, with book-to-bill greater than 1 and net backlog at a very healthy $471 million. While total deferred revenue was up $48 million quarter-over-quarter, product deferred revenue was down $35 million sequentially, primarily due to strong channel sales, resulting in lower ending channel inventory and the timing of certain future feature releases.\nTotal revenue was $1,274,000,000, up 7% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Product revenue was up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 15% from a year ago. Services revenue was also strong at $300 million, up 5% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year of 2013, total revenue was $4,669,000,000, up 7% year-over-year. There were no 10% customers in Q4 or for the full fiscal year, which reflects the continued diversity of our business.\nFor the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.30, including a $0.04 pretax impact from restructuring charges and a $0.04 benefit from a lower tax rate. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.43, up $0.10 sequentially and increased significantly $0.15 year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven primarily by high revenue and operating margins, which were at their highest level since Q1 of 2011. For the full fiscal year, GAAP diluted earnings were $0.86, up $0.51 for the year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $1.28, up by $0.43 or 51% year-over-year.\nNow let me provide color on revenue by region, market and product area. Americas revenue was up 4% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. Americas service provider revenue was down 2% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. The trend in bookings, however, was notably different, as we saw strong bookings in the Americas service provider business, up more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to see strength across the customer base, especially in cable and content or Web 2.0 providers. Americas enterprise grew strongly at 16% sequentially and 29% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in both financial and federal sectors. EMEA revenue was up strongly at 17% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven by strong service provider performance in Germany, U.K. and Eastern Europe. EMEA enterprise also rebounded nicely in the quarter. APAC increased 5% sequentially and 18% over Q4 of last year. Both service provider and enterprise grew in the region. While we are encouraged by the performance in the quarter, there's still some work that needs to be done to get the region growing on a more consistent basis.\nService provider revenue for the quarter was $827 million, up 5% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, with good new design wins across all 3 theaters. Enterprise revenue was $447 million, up 12% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, with broad-based strength across the customer verticals. For the full fiscal year, service provider revenues were $3,054,000,000, up 9%. And enterprise revenue was $1,615,000,000, up 4%. While the growth was across all customer segments, content and cable were the key drivers. It is worth noting that over 50% of the total revenue growth in 2013 came from the web services content and cable customers.\nNow let me review our revenue by product area. Total router product revenue was $618 million, was up 1% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. While routing revenue in the quarter was healthy, bookings were very strong and grew over 20% sequentially and over 30% year-over-year, driven by MX and PTX product lines. In addition, our newly released MX104 router is off to a solid start. For the full year, router product revenue grew 14%. Total switching product revenue was a record $199 million, up 35% sequentially and 36% from a year ago. This was driven by strong sales of EX and QFabric. And we are very pleased with the EX design wins with top enterprise and service provider customers and key data center wins, which resulted in significant sequential and year-over-year increase in QFabric revenue.\nIn the quarter, we also shipped the QFX5100 top-of-rack switch and expect it to be a very good contributor to our switching portfolio going forward. For the full year, switching product revenue grew 15%. Total security product revenue was $157 million, an increase of 9% sequentially. Bookings also increased sequentially for the third quarter in a row. We saw a moderation in the decline on a year-over-year basis to 7%. As I've noted in the last couple of quarters, we have begun to see good signs in this business and customer feedback is encouraging. So while revenue for the full year was down by 16%, the last few quarters of demand indicated that we are in the midst of a turnaround.\nOur new products, as designated by the Financial Analyst Meeting in 2012, including T4000 PTX, QFabric, MobileNext and ACX, generated slightly less than $140 million in bookings in Q4, short of our goal of $150 million. Since we set the goal, we eliminated the MobileNext product and have also introduced a number of other new product lines, not included in the above goal.\nMoving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 64.2% compared to 64.4% last quarter and 65.3% a year ago. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 64.9%, down slightly over the last quarter, mainly due to product mix. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 61.9%, up 0.6 points from last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $539 million, an increase of $10 million sequentially and higher than we expected. This increase was primarily due to high commission-related costs due to the higher demand and an increase in legal expenses. Absent these items, our operating expenses would have declined sequentially.\nI had mentioned at the last earnings call that we would be undertaking some restructuring and rebalancing actions in the fourth quarter. We executed to that plan and eliminated 248 positions, of which 112 were in R&D and 95 in sales and marketing. We ended the quarter with 9,483 heads, down 231 heads or 2% sequentially. In the quarter, we took an $18.9 million restructuring charge, of which $13.9 million was related to headcount action. For the full year, operating expenses were $2,102,000,000 or 45% of revenue, down from $2,124,000,000 or 48.7% of revenue for the 2012 year. This reduction was in spite of legal expenses in the year that were approximately $30 million higher than expected. As Shaygan outlined, we are focusing on making changes to the overall cost structure and will present that plan to you in a few weeks.\nNon-GAAP operating margin for the quarter expanded to 21.9% compared to 19.8% last quarter and up strongly over the 18.2% last year. The sequential increase was driven by higher revenue and an improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. For the full year, operating margin expanded by 23% to finish at 19.2% for the year. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.8% compared to 25.5% last quarter. This improvement is primarily due to the geographic mix of income and some onetime items.\nLooking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion of net cash and investments. We generated strong operating cash flows of $390 million due to the higher operating margins and our continued focus on the cash conversion cycle. Q4 DSO was 41 days, down from 42 days last quarter. Capital expenditures were $50 million, while depreciation and amortization expense were $45 million. We repurchased 11.8 million shares for $242 million at an average price of $20.47. We had $1 billion remaining on our current authorization. And as Shaygan previously noted, we have been working on our capital allocation policy and we will present this strategy, along with our integrated operating plan, in the next few weeks.\nNow I will review our outlook for Q1 of 2014. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We believe that the underlying demand trend for our markets will remain healthy in 2014. We expect the March quarter to reflect typical seasonality in the top line. And as a reminder, we see a Q1 increase in OpEx as a result of the impact of FICA taxes. We also expect legal expenses to continue at their elevated levels that we've seen since Q3 of last year. Please note that our outlook for March does not include the potential impact of activities related to the execution of our Integrated Operating Plan, which we will be sharing with you within the next few weeks.\nFor the first quarter of 2014, we expect revenues to range from $1,120,000,000 to $1,160,000,000. At the midpoint, this reflects a growth of 8% year-over-year, highlighting our expectation of continued momentum in the underlying demand. At the midpoint of guidance, gross margins are expected to be in the range of 64%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be flat to slightly down from the fourth quarter. At the midpoint, operating margins are expected to be approximately 17%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.27 and $0.30 per share and assumes a flat share count. We expect a tax rate of approximately 25%, assuming that the R&D tax credit is approved by the end of March. If it's not approved, the tax rate may be higher by 1.5 percentage points and would impact EPS by about $0.01.\nTo summarize, we anticipate overall demand to remain healthy and we will continue to focus on our innovation and our operational excellence objectives. I would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success.\nAnd now with that, let me turn it back to Shaygan for some final thoughts before we take your questions.\nShaygan Kheradpir\nThank you, Robyn. I'm excited to begin this journey with you and leverage my experience and expertise as a customer and operating executive and a technology innovator to drive value for all of our stakeholders. And I very much look forward to meeting with you, listening to you and presenting our Integrated Operating Plan in a few weeks.\nNow to the operator for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ehud Gelblum of Citi.\nEhud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division\nSo a couple of questions, if I could. Clearly, on the revenue side, guys, switching was incredibly impressive. Strong as it's been in -- certainly from a growth perspective, in [indiscernible] in forever. QFabric seems to be doing very well. Can you give some insight as to what got QFabric going now? And is it all top-of-rack switches, is it just a -- I mean, are they actually deploying real QFabric, are they just using the top-of-rack switches instead of the EX? And was there a new sales plan, was there a growth in the VAR channel, was it new products or something that really -- what really got QFabric going? And if you can give us a little bit of insight on the security side, which was nice and strong as well, was it new products, was it something of that sort to give us a sense? And then Shaygan, you've been here now for, I guess, 2.5 weeks. You said you're going to come out with a much larger plan on business model on the company going forward. Clearly, there's an activist involved that might be leading you to that. Do you think that coming out in 5 to 6 weeks after you got there is the right time, or do you -- would you actually rather have longer to take a look at the company and maybe come out with a plan, maybe 12 to 15 weeks? And if so, should we be looking for successive revisions to whatever you're coming out with, as we go forward and you learn more about the company?\nShaygan Kheradpir\nHi, Ehud, and good speaking with you. I'll take both of those questions and I'll then pass them to Rami and Robyn, they can drill in on your switching question. So first of all, I came into the company, of course, being 25 years in the industry as a technology builder and as an operator. So I have a great deal of understanding of what the customers are really looking for and, more importantly, where they're going. In fact, that's connected to the switching question as well, which I'll come back to. And obviously, I spent my last 3 years at an investment bank with my telecom expertise. So I came in with a lot of thoughts and an understanding of the company. And from the second that I was announced, I've been sort of working myself and now -- since January 1. So we're in full motion, getting started here. As far as -- and I'll pass to Rami -- I think the very first thing I did, Ehud, when I first came here, I've been peppering everybody with questions of, yes, we know they bought, they're buying a lot, who's buying and why? And the why piece of it has pretty much reaffirmed what I thought, from a customer angle, which is people are buying pretty much the same things across multiple customer sets for the same reason, which is everybody's trying to build, what I call high-IQ networks and cloud ecosystems. And as you see in our switching results and in our security results, it sort of jumps out. Those are key components of high-IQ networks and cloud ecosystems. We'll have a lot more time to talk about this when I meet you all. But I'll now pass to Rami to drill in on this, Ehud's switching question.\nRami Rahim\nSure. Thanks, Shaygan, and thanks for the question, Ehud. On the switching side, first of all, yes, we're certainly very pleased with the results that we saw in Q4. A couple of things that I will say, over the last year or so, you know that we have been in the process of essentially integrating our 2 separate switching business units. As a result of doing that, we not only streamlined the portfolio, we actually simplified the portfolio and focused it on the most pressing problems that our customers are solving today. So if you take a look at the result, a lot of the performance that we saw is, it came from that hard work in new products that we introduced just last year, like the EX4300, the EX -- the EX9200 are both examples of those products. And then from a market dynamic standpoint, we have large customers now, both on the service provider and the enterprise side, that are building a cloud network that require the kind of high performance products that we are developing. And they love not only the product themselves, but the tie-in that we have developed with our SDN solution, whether it be Contrail or with our partner at SDN solutions like VMware.\nRobyn M. Denholm\nAnd just to add to that on the security side, so we saw good growth sequentially in terms of security. And we moderated the decline year-over-year. What's driving that growth is the same that's been driving the bookings growth over the last couple of quarters and that is high-end SRX. And it comes back to the theme that both Rami and Shaygan talked about in terms of data center and what we're doing with our service provider customers as well as our enterprise customers. And so that is what drove the growth this quarter, the high-end SRX.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS.\nAmitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nRobyn, I was just trying to reconcile the commentary around strong bookings with what appears to be slightly subseasonal guide. You're guiding revenues down 10%, 11%. I think the last 3, 4 years, it's been down 7%, 8%. So I would just love to get some incremental insight. Was there some one-off orders you saw of revenues this quarter that you think won't repeat? Would love to get some clarity on the guidance relative to the bookings commentary.\nRobyn M. Denholm\nThanks, Amitabh. So on the actual guidance for Q1, at the midpoint of guidance, what we're reflecting is an 8% year-over-year growth. And our perspective is that the business is healthy across the board. We've got good design wins in all 3 geographies across the business areas. In Q1, it typically does take us a little time to get moving, if you like, but we're very pleased with the demand fundamentals that we have across all 3 areas of the business.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.\nBenjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division\nMy question is for Shaygan. Shaygan, I wanted to ask, have you -- within the plan, not that you can go through the details, but have -- is there any feeling about the product line at Juniper in your initial thoughts? Is there -- are you wed to any products or is everything deserve a full look? And then just my second part of the question, if you don't mind, is you went through the 3 points you'll address in the plan, I was just wondering if accountability will be part of it and you will tell us how we can hold you accountable for whatever we do here to make sure that the promise is fulfilled, sir.\nShaygan Kheradpir\nHi, Ben. And also hi to Amitabh, I both look forward to seeing you both shortly. So as far as the -- I'll start with the second one. Accountability is one of the big tenets of our plan, which is we're going to have a detailed Integrated Operating Plan, which includes who's going to do what, when are they do it and discrete milestones that we can track with tangible observables and make sure we are on course. The reason it's integrated and we can't do this thing in piece parts, as you well know, Ben, is that it starts with, what is your strategy, where can you win? That goes into what customers want. Where are the markets going, what are your strengths that you can win in those markets? We have to get that down and we've got a lot of progress already on that and there's good convergence and thinking with the team. So that's on that. That flows into your structure, your company structure. That flows into your cost structure. And the cost structure, you probably have an unfair advantage because you are from Barclays. It sounds similar, right? We focus on markets. We focus on automation, on process improvement, 21st century industrialization, you would know that term. And then you'll focus on rightsizing, to make sure we are sized right for the anticipated volume of the business. All of these things gets wrapped in. And then from there, you flow into return of capital. And you wrap it all in, in an integrated plan, detailed milestones with hard accountability and you can hold us accountable quarter-after-quarter for results. And I'm holding my team accountable, personally, for their pieces. And we know how to do this. I've done this all my career. And the team here is excited and energized to hit the afterburner button, so to speak. So be assured of that.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Subu Subrahmanyan of The Juda Group.\nNatarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division\nI wanted to understand, Robyn, a little bit more on the routing side. Routing growth, you've mentioned orders had grown much more strongly than revenues. If you could clarify that? And then U.S. service provider down in traditionally seasonally very strong quarter, can you just talk about what the dynamics behind that were?\nRobyn M. Denholm\nYes. Thank you, Subu. In terms of your question, from a routing perspective, we were very pleased with the routing performance in the quarter in terms of the sequential increase and year-over-year increase. We had a 1% increase sequentially off a record quarter last quarter for routing and a 16% year-over-year increase. And the strength of that is amplified in the bookings. So and that's why I called it out. The trend on revenue, as you know, sometimes follows the trend in bookings, but not always the case in terms of the one quarter view. So I wanted to add some color in terms of the bookings in routings which were very strong. And as I said, they were up over 20% sequentially and over 30% year-over-year. So the team has done a very good job on driving the design wins to bookings in the quarter from a routing perspective.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company.\nPaul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division\nTwo quick questions, if I may. First off, on the security, I thought I heard you call out the high-end SRX in particular is driving the security. My question to you on security is given this sort of lumpiness of the high-end SRX and your efforts in the branch SRX, can you share with us insight on the progress with branch SRX? And the other question, on the service provider routing piece, can you comment on the competitive landscape in pricing in particular Alcatel-Lucent and Huawei, as well as the new Cisco core routers, if that's having any impact in the landscape.\nRobyn M. Denholm\nThanks, Paul. I'll comment first on security and then I'll hand it over to Rami in terms of the competitive landscape in routing. If you look at security, we've had 3 quarters in a row now of good sequential bookings growth and it is coming from the high-end SRX. As we've talked about, that product set, we sold both into service provider and into enterprise. And the service provider buildouts are lumpy, as we've called out before. What drove the growth this quarter was actually enterprise, was the predominant reason for the high-end SRX increase. And we've talked about it in prior quarters in terms of some bookings momentum on the data center side. But on the revenue side, that is what was behind the growth in high-end SRX this quarter. And so, on the routing competitive dynamics, Rami?\nRami Rahim\nSure, certainly. The competitive situation for routing hasn't really changed. This remains a very competitive industry in the -- so the way in which we compete is essentially the same. In the Edge, for example, it's about having a single unified, the most complete, most scalable, highest performance, Universal Edge, which is the MX, which is really growing nicely for us and competing very well there, both with incumbents and new players. In the core, yes, there are different dynamics that are happening here. Certainly, there are sort of incumbents and new challengers that are coming in, but I would say that, that has not, again, changed the way in which we compete. It's a high leverage strategy using our massive T Series deployed base. It's an architectural approach to packet optical transport with our PTX. And we're actually seeing some pretty good early momentum with the MX2020 for high service rich cores around the world. In certain geos, like you mentioned, there are sort of geo-specific competitors, like in Asia. And there, it's just about being laser focused on the areas where we believe that we have the highest amount of technical differentiation. That's why we're successful.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.\nSimona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nShaygan, I had a question for you. You talked about your views on strategy influencing your approach to cost cutting and rightsizing the business. And I just wanted to ask you if at a high level you still view the strategy as staying in both service provider and enterprise is the correct strategy for Juniper? And then conceptually, how you think about businesses in which you may have a relatively small market share, such as switching, for example, in which your share is about 3%? Is that the kind of scale that you think is sufficient to keep investing in the business?\nShaygan Kheradpir\nSimona, good speaking with you. Look forward to meeting you. We have -- as part of the Integrated Operating Plan, we have one big work stream around our R&D. And so I'm actually personally involved in that one, too, given my engineering background and the background in networks. What I would tell you, Simona, is when I entered here -- so we do all the work and then we'll present to you in 3 weeks or 4 weeks or whenever that is, in a matter of weeks. But we -- what customers are buying, the customers says, we're looking at and I count them and this is sort of from my perspective coming from the customer side, these are not necessarily a taxonomy that some of you may have used in the past. So you've got our -- a great service provider customers, which is like AT&Ts and Verizons and BT and DT and down the chain. You have those sets of customers. Then you move into the cable and content and then Web 2.0 customers like Google and Amazon and the rest. And then you move into special enterprises, yours being one, Goldman Sachs and all the companies that are represented on this call. Those 4 sets of customers, with a little bit -- maybe a few others, like federal government and so forth, they pretty much are all coalescing around the same set of things, as far as networking is concerned, which is clouds and high-IQ networks. Rami talked about and Robyn talked about the key components, MX, QFabric, PTX, SRX, with the big brain called Contrail. Essentially, that's what people want to buy because they're trying to solve some very specific business problems that we'll get into when we sit down with you and go over it. So the markets are changing for a set of these customers and we just have to make sure that we will be able to win and win big in these markets, given our heritage of high performance networking, only really pure play company out there in IT networking in high performance, in open architectures, carrier-grade, super big SRX, defending the cloud and so forth and so on. And in fact, this was my view when I came in as a customer, being on both sides, operating obviously at Barclays, CIO, CTO on Verizon. And in fact, the buying -- or what people are buying and the mix is sort of confirming that. Now as I've said it last quarter, this has to continue, but it has certain logic to it. So I think that's the -- that's what in my mind, if that helps.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.\nSimon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nI want to ask what I think is a pretty quick one and then maybe more involved. First for Shaygan, if you could just maybe articulate how the activists have either influenced you or not influenced you starting in on your job. And then I wanted to follow-up on the guidance in that you highlight a number of areas with very strong bookings, so that leads us to try to figure out what's weak or are you suggesting a much better than seasonal growth rate in the June quarter?\nShaygan Kheradpir\nWell, thank you for the question. As I said, I've been in this business now exactly 27 years. And so I come in with a lot of views on where the markets are going and what the customers want. And I think that is -- since I've been actually a builder in these companies, so I have great appreciation for building. And since I've had tens of thousands of people in my organization, from an operating perspective, I was the heart of sort of operations. So I come in with a good view of what is a well-run operation. I come in with a view of what the customers want. And I come in with a view of technologically what's the art of the possible and where the markets are going. So I sort of took this job because I saw great opportunity at this phenomenal company, sort of ready to go, to put in play 27 years of my experience. So that's on that end. On the other end, obviously I am on a big listening tour and our shareholders is one of the most important stakeholders. I've been listening to shareholders, I continue to do that and the investors and the sell-side and the buy-side analysts and of course our customers to pull all this in. And we also have urgency of action because every month that passes 2014, I want to make sure the new Integrated Operating Plan is in place, the company is behind it and we can move and drive shareholder value and make sure that our customers get to solve their business problems, which is all around, how can I generate more revenue? How can I bring down my operating costs? How can I make sure I don't get hacked? And so forth and so on. These are -- when you put a customer hat on, these things -- when you actually live and sweat the details in a customer, these are -- get a different gravity. So I'm actually very confident that we will be able to come up with a great Integrated Operating Plan and put it in motion and really solve our customer problems and in the process drive great shareholder return. And just hold on for a few weeks and we'll unveil it.\nRobyn M. Denholm\nSo on the guidance question -- in terms of the midpoint of guidance, as I mentioned before, is an 8% year-over-year growth, which is actually -- reflects our confidence in the strength of the underlying business. Our view is that there is a sequential -- sorry, seasonal pattern to our Q1 business, particularly on the enterprise side. And we saw in the fourth quarter, the enterprise actually drove a lot of the year-over-year growth. And so what I want to make sure of is that we take that into account. That's what we've taken into account. The underlying demand trends are healthy. Q1 always has a seasonality to it and we wanted to appropriately reflect that in our guidance.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Mark McKechnie of Evercore.\nMark McKechnie - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division\nShaygan, welcome. I certainly look forward to working with you. A very refreshing approach here. I had a few questions. First, your background at Verizon and Barclays, 27 years in the business. I'm kind of curious, I don't know if you can expand a bit on your interaction with other carriers and enterprises. I'm sure you work with them, but are the meetings you're having with customers, new engagements or you're meeting with familiar people? Whatever you can say there. And then on the routers, I know people have beaten on this a bit, but I wanted to get a sense. I mean, that was really strong bookings, 20% sequentially. I wanted to get a sense for areas of strength where you attribute that. I mean, is this the PTX big orders here for the U.S.? Are you participating over with China Mobile? Is this Europe? Is it the T4000? I mean, what can you tell us about that? And how you see that playing out through the year.\nShaygan Kheradpir\nSure, Mark, and hi, great to be speaking with you. So yes, somebody asked me that question the other day and said, \"How do you feel?\" And I said, \"Well, I feel like I'm back home.\" In the sense that many of the accounts I go to, they are friends and colleagues from the past. Now as I said, I've been here 27 years, so some of the friends and colleagues have retired, but there's still quite a bit that are still there. And so, yes, I know many of my friends have been there for a long time. We've worked together on the buyer side of things. We have a similarity in thought across the planet. I actually used to chair the CTOs for telecoms a number of years ago when I was at Verizon. And by the way, on the enterprise side, I used to chair the CIOs for a number of years. And so I have a lot of friends there as well. And in fact, my rotation at Barclays, which I have to say was completely phenomenal and magical, I've gotten to be even closer to my CIO friends at the banks and financial services. So yes, it sort of feels in the family but, of course, as time goes on, I become more of the supplier and they become more of the buyer. But at this point, it's very much like coming back home. As far as the routers and PTX is concerned, I'll ask Rami to give us some color on that.\nRami Rahim\nYes, sure. Happy to. Thanks, Mark. So on the router side, I think one of the really encouraging things about the booking was just the diversity in who bought. So we saw strength in our large telcos, even our smaller Tier 2 telcos, our cable operators and also the Web 2.0s. So that diversity is something that we track and something that we consider as very healthy. From a product standpoint, very specifically, MX continues to do very well and the particular applications here that we're driving are convergence of Edge and aggregation networks to simplify operations for our customers, data center interconnect to connect clouds together. And then the other area where we saw some real strength from a booking standpoint is in PTX. As you know, PTX is somewhat of a different architectural approach. So the sales cycles are long and what we're seeing now are the results of the design wins that we had several quarters ago now turning into sales. And the last thing I'll just say is in each of those product line, the MX and PTX, we introduced new specific products in Q4. We introduced the MX104 that takes all of the sophisticated capabilities of the MX down to a very small, power efficient form factor that's ideal for smaller operators and now into the access navigation part of the network. And similarly, the PTX3000 that takes the transport capabilities of that platform and takes it into the metro transport area. So we're expanding the applicable footprint for each of these product lines.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.\nBrian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division\nShaygan, congratulations on the new opportunity. Obviously, some of the fastest-growing workloads on the planet are housed in a lot of the hyperscale guys. And you gave some comments on the conference call with respect to how much that and in conjunction with some other businesses, like cable, are growing for you, over 50% of your incremental growth over the last 12 months. But I guess I was wondering if you care to take a stab, did your hyperscale business actually grow in line with what we estimate is kind of 30% CapEx growth year-over-year? Or perhaps, maybe what percent of your total revenue is coming from this group? 5%, 10%, something like that? Any color would be helpful.\nShaygan Kheradpir\nBrian, good to meet you. A really good question. This -- the Web 2.0 and, by the way, the cable and the content businesses are also dear friends of mine for many years, got good insight into those networks, have worked with them for many years. And I'll ask Robyn to take that question around their cloud that they're building and their growth. Go ahead.\nRobyn M. Denholm\nYes. I think, Brian, in terms of the overall full year, what we wanted to give you color on is where the growth was coming from. And the comments that I made was that it was -- those areas of web services, content and cable actually accounted for more than 50% of the overall growth of the company for the 2013 year. And I think the comment that Shaygan made is very applicable because it's a cross-sector view of those types of companies. And even in some of our traditional companies, there are faster growing parts of that company's revenue with us or their CapEx spend with us, if you like, than other parts. And so that's what we were trying to convey with that comment, that there is faster parts of the market that are growing even in some of the traditional areas, as well as some of these newer opportunities and newer type companies on the web services and cable side.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.\nRoderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nShaygan, welcome aboard and congratulations. So I just had a quick one, I guess, for Shaygan. Can you help us understand how in prior leadership positions that you've taken on, you've thought about the structure of your leadership team? And just as an example, we've had a person take over our company recently as the new CEO and he said, \"I like to have 1/3 of the people existing managers, 1/3 internal promotes and 1/3 external.\" So just any rules of thumb that you think about when you think about structuring your leadership team? And also, just timing on that, how soon do you want to make critical hires if you have to make them? And then I wanted to ask Robyn, if -- Robyn, could you talk to us a little bit about government revenues and what happened in the quarter? I don't think I heard you comment on that. So if could you give us any indication on what federal and non-federal revenues did in the quarter? And then, Rami, I wanted to just go back to your commentary on the switching and also Robyn's commentary on the routing order growth. Can you help us understand what the concentration of those orders is? Like in switching, was it a handful of big customers or is it spread pretty broadly? And then also on the routing orders, is that a few big customers or broadly spread?\nShaygan Kheradpir\nThanks, Rod. Thanks for the question. A broad question. As I said, I've had many, many years in this, both Verizon and Barclays, and many -- tens of thousands of people. And I think it's, at the top level, it all starts with what are we trying to do, where are we trying to win. So this is why it's really important to get the focus on product innovation and our markets really right because that flows in what I used to call strength on strength. Have excellent people positioned in the areas that they can put -- push the ball for us forward through excellence. And then it's working as one team, as one Barclays -- I'm sorry, one Juniper, one Juniper, one Juniper. I've had one Verizon, one Barclays, one Juniper, I'm consistent. And then, as you talk to the people about me, it's all the same, right? Because you have success and you repeat that. And then you have execution with no excuses and metabolism execution with no excuses. I look for people who are detail oriented, they're hands on, not a lot of layers, massive focus on the customer, massive know-how internally and really have that outside-in focus brought infused with an inside-out art of the possible, camp on customer's door and execute. And so that's sort of the management philosophy. And now I'm going to pass in to Robyn for the second part of the question.\nRobyn M. Denholm\nThank you. Thanks, Rod. In terms of the government business, I did actually call out that the government area -- enterprise was actually very strong in the quarter. We had good sequential and year-over-year growth in enterprise all up. The federal team did an outstanding job this quarter. If you remember back to the guidance that we called out on last quarter, I was expecting federal to be weak this quarter. And actually, the team did a really good job and actually they had a good quarter in Q4. Clearly, the federal business, the government business is down for us for the full year, year-over-year, which also underscores the fact that enterprise, absent the full -- from a full year perspective, absent government, has actually been growing very nicely all year. The other commentary on the fourth quarter was that financial services was strong and that's a global comment. So from my perspective, a good enterprise quarter, a good service provider quarter and a good federal quarter in Q4. Go ahead, Rami.\nRami Rahim\nThe only thing I will add is, I already added some color on the diversity of customers on our routing side. On the switching side, there too we saw a good distribution between enterprise, especially at the financial services, Web 2.0s, and also service provider. We have said in the past that the service provider component of the switching business can be lumpy. And for this quarter or Q4, I should say, we saw real strength in both SP and enterprise. I think that just based on the -- what we're seeing in terms of demand metric, I'm pretty confident about 2014.\nOperator\nThe final question comes from Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald.\nBrian John White - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division\nShaygan, welcome. I'm wondering, what type of forum are we -- are you introducing the Integrated Operating Plan, you said 3 to 4 weeks. Is this an analyst type meeting or is this going to be a conference call? That's question number one. Number two, maybe talk a little bit about what Juniper is seeing in emerging markets. A lot of peers are complaining about emerging markets, specifically China. Maybe give us just an overview of what Juniper is seeing in emerging markets.\nShaygan Kheradpir\nThanks for the question. On the forum, actually, we are working that as we speak. So stay tuned on that. As far as the emerging markets, Robyn, you want to take that one?\nRobyn M. Denholm\nYes. In terms of emerging markets for us, and there are many different emerging markets around the world for us. What I would say, at a high level, our strategy is quite different in some of the emerging markets. You mentioned, for example, China. What we've done at the company is be very focused in terms of the areas where we are most differentiated in that market and Rami mentioned that before. And so our approach varies by market. We're very surgical in some markets where we focus on those areas where we have the most differentiated and we win opportunities in those markets. So from my perspective, our emerging market strategy is different. We sell through partners in a number of different locations through the -- across the world. From a technology perspective, the technology that we sell is consistent and it's in high demand in different parts of the world in terms of that focus.\nKathleen Nemeth\nOkay, thank you. That, unfortunately, is all the time we have today. Shaygan, would you like to have a closing comment?\nShaygan Kheradpir\nYes. It's -- I'm thrilled to be here and I'm really looking forward to seeing all of you very shortly and have a much deeper conversation about everything we talked about and hear your views of Juniper and our industry. So look forward to seeing you all. Thank you. Have a great day.\nKathleen Nemeth\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.\n\n",

(Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. \nI would now like to turn your conference over to Ms. Ruth Ann Wisener. \n\nRuth Ann Wisener\nThank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods conference call for our 2008 fourth quarter. With me today are Dick Bond, our President and CEO and Dennis Leatherby, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin to discuss the operating performance for the quarter, I want to remind everyone that some of the things we talk about today will include forward-looking statements.\nThose statements are based on our view of the world as we know it today which could change. I encourage you to look at today's press release for discussion of the risks that can affect our business.\nI will now turn the call over to Dick Bond.\nDick Bond\nWelcome. 2008 was a difficult year in the protein business, which isn't news to any of you, but I'm proud of much of what we've done in this year and I hope the losses in our chicken business don't overshadow several significant accomplishments. \nIf you were looking at Tyson Foods from the perspective of our business model, what our strategy is and what steps we have taken to execute our strategy, we have been moving the ball forward all year.\nFirst this is a multi-protein company which mitigates the impact, when one segment is struggling. 2008 is a prime example of this business model and action. The Chicken segments bad year doesn't outweigh record setting pork margins or remarkable year-over-year turnaround in beef.\nSecond we are moving ahead on our international growth strategy and I have made multiple acquisitions and joint ventures this year. In past up times, we have pulled back from plans to expand especially internationally and it has slowed our progress, not this time.\nThird we have a strong balance sheet. We issued equity and convertible debt in September to close those international deals. We didn't have to do it, but it allowed us to keep the company on track for long-term growth.\nFourth we are moving forward with our renewable products initiatives including the dynamic fuels, renewable diesel plant in the Louisiana. \nI'll talk about these things in more detail in my segment report, but now I'd like to turn the call over to Dennis, who will go into the specifics on our financial result, as well as our international deals and the stock offering. \nDennis Leatherby\nThank you, Dick. As stated in our press release in Q4 '08, we achieved GAAP earnings of $0.13 per share in a very challenging environment. This compares to earnings of $0.09 per share in Q4 '07. Q4 \u201808 results include certain intangible impairments of $0.02 per share.\nOur effective tax rate from continuation operations for the quarter was 50.1% and usually higher rate is attributable to lower overall pretax earnings and the impact of certain nondeductible expenses.\nOne other item of note in fourth quarter fiscal 2008, we changed our segment reporting to move our logistics operation profits, which are [inter-companied] by nature from the other segment to Beef, Pork, Chicken or Prepared Foods. All prior periods have been restated to reflect this change.\nWe feel this move will make the segment reporting more meaningful as we go forward and please note also that the historical allocation breakdown is roughly 55% chicken, 20% beef, 15% pork and 10% prepared foods.\nTurning to the fiscal year results for fiscal '08, we achieved GAAP EPS of $0.24 per share compared to $0.75 per share for fiscal '07. This $0.24 includes $0.10 of non-operating images. Sales grew to $26.9 billion just over $1 billion higher than fiscal \u201807. \nCash on hand at the end of fiscal \u201908 was $250 million. Total debt at year end was approximately $2.9 billion a slight increase from 2007, as we sought capital to fund acquisitions for two exciting and important pillars of our strategy, international and renewable products, more on that in a moment.\nWe ended the year with our debt-to-cap ratio at 36.6% down slightly from the end of fiscal '07. Capital expenditures for '08 were $425 million compared to $285 million for '07. $139 million of this capital was allocated to improve our operations in the Chicken segment and Dick will discuss this further on his segment comments.\nDiluted weighted shares outstanding for the quarter were around $358 million shares a slight increase over Q4 '07 due mainly to our stock offering late in the quarter. As you know, during September '08, we raised $670 million of net proceeds from our offering after fees and costs. $396 million of the proceeds came from the convertible bond transaction costs associated with the bond hedge more on proceeds. $274 million was netted from the Class A common stock offering and the way we look at it is the pretax rate on the convertibles of 5.5% is pretty cheap capital.\nThe net proceeds were used toward the repayment of our borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization and for other general corporate purposes. Paying down the accounts receivable securitization freed up capital for international acquisitions and future efforts in our renewable products division.\nIn October 2008, we completed the acquisition of three vertically integrated poultry operations in southern Brazil. The purchase price was $80 million and additional $10 to $15 million that\u2019s contingent purchase price based on production volumes payable through fiscal 2010. These transactions include the acquisitions of Macedo, Avicola and Frangobras combined we expect these companies will have sales in the $150 to $175 million range for 2009.\nAdditionally, once the joint venture with Shandong Xinchang receives the necessary government approvals, we expect to spend $110 to $115 million to acquire 60% ownership in that company. We anticipate this will be finalized during fiscal 2009. At desire capacities, we expect our international investments to generate ROICs of 20% or better. I'll discuss post acquisition CapEx in a moment.\nWe hope to complete the sale of Lakeside, our Canadian beef business by the end of fiscal first quarter of 2009 with plans to use the proceeds, as available to pay down debt and for other general corporate purposes. Including working capital of Lakeside initially retained by asset closing as well as consideration received from XL Foods, we expect the following future cash flows based on the year end exchange rate.\nWe expect to receive $55 million at closing approximately $136 million in calendar 2009 and then $49 million in notes receivable plus interest to be paid over two years by XL Foods and $29 million of preferred stocks in XL redeemable over five years. \nHere are the projections specified information for fiscal '09. Revenues, we expect to be in the range of $28 billion to $29 billion. As a result of the common offering, weighted average shares will be approximately 377 million shares. Net interest expense is expected to be around $225 million. \nDepreciation and amortization is expected to be around $525 million. Capital spending will go up compared to fiscal '08 and we expect the following ranges. Approximately, $425 million to $450 million will be used to spend for our core business operations. Approximately $100 to $120 million on post acquisition capital spending will be used for Brazilian and Chinese acquisitions, and approximately $75 to $80 million is related to our Dynamic Fuels facility. \nThe cost to construct this facility is estimated to be  $138 million, which will be funded by $100 million of Gulf Opportunity tax exempt bonds issued in October of 2008 along with equity contributions made by Tyson and Syntroleum, most of which have already been made. \nIn closing, I would just like to reiterate what Dick said about our company. I feel very confident about the prospects for Tyson Foods. I am really proud of what our Fresh Meats team has done and beef and pork models are really running well and they are optimizing their commodity business models and competing favorably with anyone. \nI also believe our chicken business is well on its way to doing the same. In short, we have made great progress on our strategies to build the multinational enterprise and we continue developing more opportunities to build value in renewable products area. I believe all those efforts are positioning our company for a strong long-term future. Now I will pass it back to Dick for a review of the segments.\nDick Bond\nWe're going to start with the chicken segment. 2008 was an extremely tough year for the chicken business and the fourth quarter was the most difficult. We lost $91 million in the chicken segment in the fourth quarter and $118 million for the year. Volume was up 6% for the quarter and down 4/10 of a percent for the year. \nPrices were up in average of 5.5% for the quarter and 9% for the year, but that was not enough to keep pace with input costs. We had almost $600 million in additional grain cost in fiscal '08. Total chicken segment inputs were up $900 million over fiscal 2007. \nDespite the operating environment, we were able to make progress in several areas. To better serve the broad ranging needs of our customers, we placed an organizational focus on increasing the profitability of our small bird model. \nWe also converted some plants to a large bird model. As Dennis said, we spent $139 million in CapEx this fiscal year to improve operating efficiencies in our plants. The CapEx along with profit improvement projects in our sales channel should generate more than $250 million in annualized cash flow improvements. \nAlthough higher input cost mass the impact to some extent, we have improved our position relative to the competition as reflected in a number of industry benchmarking studies. We are currently identifying cost savings and revenue enhancing projects for 2009 to further improve our position. \nAs always, we have been carrying out our strategy to create innovative and insight driven food products. Our Food Service group won the [Kennedale] and Cognitio awards for the sixth consecutive year. [Kennedale] identifies the elite manufacturers and operators, as evaluated by their trading partners. Cognitio identifies the manufacturer that did the best job of bringing new products to Food Service operators. \nI think these awards demonstrate how important joint value creation is to our customers. Parts of the Food Service industry are hurting in this economy, and we believe our R&D, culinary and consumer insight teams are playing a vital role in helping our customers get through these difficult times. They are relying on us and our proprietary resources of our Discovery Center to help them develop products and menu ideas that will drive traffic by offering value to consumers. \nNot all of the Food Service industry is hurting, however. Although, fewer people are eating away from home, when they do, they don't want to spend as much. As a result, quick service continues to grow. \nThe QSR fast-casual segment represents almost half of our food service business, and 80% of our National Accounts business. These customers have dependent on us to ensure that they have large quantities that they need for National promotions. \nCustomers in all channels have expressed concern to us about the condition of other companies in the chicken industry and their ability to ensure supply. More people are eating at home. However, and the retail and club store industries is seeing growth, although traffic and buying patterns have changed. Shoppers are making fewer trips, but buying more per trip. \nWe help our retail customers with products and strategies to bring people into their stores, while giving consumers value for their money. In October, we unveiled a new line of 100% All Natural Chicken Nuggets, Patties and Tenders that are minimally processed and contain no artificial ingredients, preservatives or fillers.\nWe are supporting this launch with a new advertising spot that was recognized by Nielsen IAG as one of the top ten most recalled new TV ads. This product category represents a value alternative to eating out and we will continue innovating to provide customers and consumers the products they want.\nAs for the outlook for Chicken in early fiscal '09 export markets, credit availability, and the recent strengthening dollar had impacted late quarter pricing significantly. Prices are already in the low 20s to the high teens, although sales recorded in October will keep our average for the quarter in the mid to upper 30s.\nSales are difficult to come by right now because of trade disputes not lack of demand. Until renegotiated quotas and other technical issues are resolved, looking [late] quarter sales especially to Russia will be difficult. Also we have several cost plus and fixed price contracts with customers for which we have hedged some grain positions.\nThese positions as well as some corporate long positions could impact first quarter results depending upon where corn and soybean meal, close in December. Some of those positions will be mark-to-market at the end of the quarter and are included in our covenant calculations, but other positions would be factored in.\nThe Beef segment had a great fourth quarter with a 5% operating margin. Looking at the third and fourth quarters combined, we had a 3% margin, which is at the upper end of our normalized range.\nThe important thing to remember about our Beef business is that we've turned it around from a $254 million loss in 2006 to $106 million gain for 2008 that's a remarkable turnaround and we are really proud of that accomplishment.\nSales prices were up 13% and 6% for the fourth quarter and the year respectively, while sales volumes were down 7.5% for the quarter and 4.6% for the year. The lower volumes are the result of ceasing slaughter operations at our Emporia, Kansas plant in February. Capacity utilization improved to 83.6% compared to 82.8% in Q4 of last year.\nIn the third quarter, the Beef segment had a negative $75 million impact from a mark-to-market accounting treatment related to forward cattle purchases. At the time, I told you we would offset about half of that loss in fourth quarter. I am pleased to report that we had a $41 million recoup and anticipate regaining the remainder of that balance in the first and second quarters of fiscal '09.\nThe economy has affected consumer beef purchases. People are still eating beef but they are trading down in cuts. Sales are the more expensive, [wither] line cuts are down, while chuck and ground beef sales are up. We expect this trend to continue in 2009.\nFast beef exports were very good in the fourth quarter. Sales were up 63% on volume and 68.5% on net sales as compared to Q4 of '07. With the South Korean market open, we have 1,250 containers booked for shipment for the August through November period. For Beef in 2009, we anticipate export disappearance to continue.\nWe think cattle supplies will be down 1% to 2% in fiscal '09, but there should be ample cattle to run our plants efficiently. Given our focus on operations and managing the business, I'm confident in our position going into 2009.\nThe Pork segment had its best July through September period ever with a 7.5% operating margin and its best fiscal year ever with a 7.8% margin. Sales volume was up 2% for the quarter and 6% for the year.\nThe segment benefited significantly from lowered hog prices most of the year, but I don't want to overlook the work our fresh meets team has done to improve pork's performance. They have executed our strategy to optimize our commodity businesses by improving staffing and yield, while keeping costs under control.\nCapacity utilization improved 2.5% over Q4 of '07 to 85.6% in Q4 of '08. With a Q4 gross margin well above the industry average, I think Tyson Foods currently is running the best most efficient pork business in the country. They are likely to be fewer hogs in 2009, but still above the five year average and an ample supply to produce good operating results.\nSome export markets are going to be difficult especially with the strengthening dollar. However sow liquidation in the EU and Canada will position the US to be a good source for high quality pork. We probably aren't going to see any more record breaking quarters in 2009, but I think our pork segment will continue to do very well. \nThe prepared food segment sales were up 9% quarter-over-quarter. While fluctuation and prices for pork raw materials, higher wheat, dairy and cooking ingredients, more than offset pricing gains resulting in a $5 million loss for the quarter. \nWe've gained national distribution of our right brand bacon. However, other parts of our refrigerated processed meats business have struggled. We have a team working on this, to get it turned around and I expect to see significant improvements in 2009. Sales of pepperoni pizza toppings, pizza crusts and tortilla soups and sauces remain strong with opportunities for volume growth for the fiscal 2009 year, although high input costs are likely to continue. \nTurning to international sales, despite some concerns about global credit and trade restrictions in the short-term, we believe underlying demand is still strong in the long term. There is a 30 to 60 day supply in the pipeline, and when it's gone, we believe there will be increased demand for our protein products. Countries import protein because they can't produce enough to feed their own people and that really hasn't changed. \nWe will continue with our strategy to build a multinational company, because international sales and production will be a primary source for Tyson Foods future growth. We have work to do in integrating the multiple acquisitions and joint ventures we made in the past several months. \nWhile some of these entities are established and profitable, others are greenfield or newly operational. So we anticipate it will be 2010, before we begin to see the returns from them in the aggregate. \nIn our renewable products group, we have broken ground on the Dynamics Fuels renewable plant. The project is on budget and on schedule to begin production in January 2010. Unfortunately, we have to rethink our strategic alliance with ConocoPhillips. [Conoco] has reduced the tax credit from $1 to $0.50 a gallon, making the project currently unprofitable. \nI think the government is being shortsighted in favoring ethanol over renewable diesel. I know many people don't like the idea of big oil companies getting tax credits, but they may not realize it is the oil companies that receive the tax credit for blending ethanol into gasoline, not the ethanol producers. I believe the new energy technology should compete on a level playing field and the superior technology whatever that may be, should prevail. \nIn addition to fuel, pet food is a primary focus of our renewable products group. In January, we announced a strategic alliance with Kemin Industries to develop, manufacture, market and sell flavor enhancers known as palatants to the North American pet food market. We assigned a team to this project and are on schedule to start production next month at our River Valley Animal Feed plant in Texarkana. \nIn closing, we are a little bit more than a month into the first quarter, and we have limited visibility into what will happen with both export markets and input costs volatility early in fiscal '09. The second half of the year should be better as predicted lower chicken supplies should improve pricing, beef usually has its strongest performance in the third and fourth quarters, and pork will do well all year. \nIn the short-term, we will handle the difficult market conditions as effectively as possible, and I believe we are in a good position because we have the right strategy, a solid management team, and a strong balance sheet. I don't think there's another protein company better positioned than Tyson Foods for long-term growth. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Julie and we will take your questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions). First question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Sir your line is open.\nKen Goldman - JP Morgan\nGood morning.\nDennis Leatherby\nMorning Ken\nKen Goldman - JP Morgan\nA question about pork. You said, even though there is limited visibility that pork will do well all year, there is some evidence out there. I know it's early, that maybe global demand for pork is starting to slip a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about that what you are seeing and maybe if it's true or not true, and where you are seeing some strength continuing?\nDennis Leatherby\nWell Ken, I would tell you that, again going back first to supply, I think that supply will be very good even though it might be down a little bit. We had record supplies of pork in '08. So while '09 might be down a couple percentage points. \nI still think there is going to be plenty of pork again to run our plants efficiently. If we think about the export markets, I think China right now is probably an area that has slipped a little bit post the Olympics, but we are still seeing very strong demand in Mexico as a prime example. \nWe are still seeing very strong demand in Asia primarily in Japan and South Korea, and Russia is probably an area where we have still seen reasonably good volume, and who knows what's going happen there in the short-term. But again it goes back to the factor that countries import protein because they need it to feed their people.\nSo, we are very confident that the export markets overall will continue to be strong in fiscal '09 and I just think we are running a very, very solid pork business right now.\nKen Goldman - JP Morgan\nOkay, and then can you give us some idea of just how bad chicken will be for you in the first fiscal quarter? It's hard for us to get an exact idea, where your hedges are and so forth, but I know, you don\u2019t provide exact guidance, but some conversation a little bit about specificity, I think would help investors.\nDick Bond\nWell, I won't give you any exact numbers. I'll just talk for the hedges for a minute. The hedges and around the hedge activity will be dependent again on what corn and soybean meal prices are at the end of December. I don't know what they are going to be. Nobody knows what they are going to be and that's a huge factor in terms of mark-to-market end results for chicken in Q1.\nSo somebody can tell me what the answer to that was, I'd be a little bit more able to answer that with some specificity. I will tell you though that Q1 given where legs quarter prices are, breast meat prices are, we are going to lose some significant dollars in Q1.\nIt's really hard for me to give you even a range again because not knowing exactly what inputs are going to be and what is going to happen in terms of, will supplies stay where they are, will supplies stay not where they are. But at this point, six weeks into the quarter, it's not going to be a good quarter. It will be a negative quarter in chicken and most likely a negative quarter overall for our results.\nKen Goldman - JP Morgan\nOkay. Thanks very much. That's helpful.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Christina McGlone with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nChristina McGlone - Deutsche Bank\nGood morning.\nDick Bond\nGood morning, Christina.\nChristina McGlone - Deutsche Bank\nDick, I guess, my first questions, if you look at current demand dynamics including whatever is going on with the Russia this morning announcing a 300,000 ton quarter cut for next year and the tight credit conditions, do you think we'll just see outright closure of capacity in chicken? I am kind of thinking, why wouldn't we? What are the barriers there and what is the alternative?\nDick Bond\nWell, Christina, I can't speak for whether we will or as an industry will or won't have any closures. I think we have over the course of the past several years closed four, five facilities; inefficient facilities are going to be something that is going to have to be looked at by everybody.\nI'm not sure what's going to happen in terms of outright capacity reduction. I do believe that overall supplies of chicken will continue to decline. We did see double digit exits down last week.\nSo, I think supply will continue to probably decline. But it's hard for me to say what might happen in terms of pure out and out capacity reduction. I'm uncomfortable at all trying to speculate on that.\nChristina McGlone - Deutsche Bank\nThe 10% reduction in exits that you referenced, is that enough to get the industry back to profitability?\nDick Bond\nNo. I think that depends upon demand. It could be or it might not be depending upon both domestic and export demand. I would guess at this point that it might need to be a little bit more than that.\nChristina McGlone - Deutsche Bank\nOkay. Dennis I just wanted to touch on pension. So, given the equity market performance, what is the expected cash contribution in fiscal 2009 and if any what are the incremental headwinds in terms of pension expense in the P&L?\nDennis Leatherby\nAs far as the pensions go Christina, we have three closed pension funds and our contribution based on the actuarial analysis is only going to be about $1 million for next year.\nWe also have a non-qualified benefit plan that based on the same actuarial analysis would result in another million dollars in pension contributions required from the company. So, it's not too much.\nChristina McGlone - Deutsche Bank\nWhat about pension expenses, they are big incremental difference?\nDennis Leatherby\nNo. It\u2019s about $6 million.\nChristina McGlone - Deutsche Bank\nOkay. Thank you.\nDick Bond\nThanks, Christina.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Heather Jones with BB&T Capital Markets.\nHeather Jones - BB&T Capital Markets\nGood morning.\nDick Bond\nGood morning, Heather.\nHeather Jones - BB&T Capital Markets\nI have a quick question on your covenants. As far as your leverage covenant it looks like at the end of the quarter, it was about 3.1 times and I think, it's not supposed to exceed 3.9.\nBut I just wonder, if you could speak given that you are expecting, it seems a pretty challenging quarter for Q1 and Lakeside hasn't closed yet. I was wondering what your view is as far as your comfort level with that covenant at this point at the end of Q1.\nDick Bond\nSure. To correct you just a little bit, it's closer to 3.2\u2026\nHeather Jones - BB&T Capital Markets\nOkay.\nDick Bond\nEBITDA for fiscal '08. In terms of the outlook, the first quarter, it is going to be a little bit tight and so again it depends on these grain positions at the end of the quarter.\nHeather Jones - BB&T Capital Markets\nDid you say that some of those grain positions will be mark-to-market and won't be included in your EBITDA?\nDick Bond\nThat's correct. Yes, the way it works is that anything as a mark-to-market position will be added back to the debt to EBITDA covenant.\nHeather Jones - BB&T Capital Markets\nI mean, how tight are we talking about? Should we be expecting that you need to be in discussions with your lenders for waivers or you don't expect it to be that tight?\nDick Bond\nWe don't have a clear view on that. I will say that we've had a great track record working with our banks. It's a very supportive bank group. They've supported us through a lot and helped us even in this most recent amendment. So, we are very comfortable that we do need to do something whether it be a waiver or amendment that will be, we have it get it done usually.\nHeather Jones - BB&T Capital Markets\nOkay.\nDennis Leatherby\nHeather we don't believe this is going to be a big problem for us. If that happens, and if it gets tight, which it could, we are very, very confident that our bank group will work with us. That is not an issue as far as we are concerned.\nHeather Jones - BB&T Capital Markets\nWhat is going on with Lakeside? I think on your Q3 call, you had expected to close during Q4, and now it's been pushed out to Q1. Is this a function of the credit market or is there something else going on there?\nDennis Leatherby\nNo it really isn't a function of the credit market. It is just a function of the time that it is taking to go through the Competition Bureau up in Canada. They have asked kind of for a second request, if you will, for information. It's just taken a little bit longer than what we had thought to process. Still don't believe there's going to be any problem from that standpoint. It has just taken a little bit longer than what we anticipated.\nHeather Jones - BB&T Capital Markets\nOkay. I just have two more quick questions. When you said that the production cuts assuming this double digit holds, do you think that's not enough to get you to profitability or is not enough to get you to normal margins?\nDennis Leatherby\nI would say probably not enough to get to normalized margins. I think certainly that would get to us a profitable level, but I don't know if it would be necessarily get us to normalized.\nHeather Jones - BB&T Capital Markets\nOkay, and then, my final question, you spoke about export demand and I appreciate the color. But, I was wondering what you've seen specifically in October and early November as far as domestic demand on the food service side, specifically casual dining. Have you seen further deterioration there? Have trends slowed in QSR or just if you could give us some color.\nDennis Leatherby\nSure. QSR continues to be extremely good. I would say very good, given the current conditions. The segment that is hurting the most is that mid-scale casual dining, and there I would say that it's been a little bit more discouraging in October, early November than even what it was in the August, September period. But we are working on products and value related products to try and stimulate that demand for that sector that takes a little bit of time, but I think they are all focused on that as well. \nHow can they get their traffic count back up? How can they keep their ticket or their sales ticket price relatively low and we are working as hard as we possibly can to help them in that vein. But you are right. It has been probably a little bit worse than the August, September period.\nHeather Jones - BB&T Capital Markets\nOkay. I appreciate it.\nDennis Leatherby\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets\nHey, good morning, everyone.\nDennis Leatherby\nGood morning Ken.\nKenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets\nOn the chicken side, demand has clearly declined both on the export and food service side, and the industry excluding probably you and Sanderson Farms has clearly had a fairly aggressive cut, and my understanding has been that Tyson would begin to cut and maybe go along with the industry once the demand is cutting lower and there's been evidence of industry rationalization. I guess my question is what are you guys doing? Are you guys starting to do that?\nDennis Leatherby\nWell, Ken, I'll go back and I think what I have always said pretty routinely was that we would match the demand from a customer's perspective with our supply, and I would tell you that I'm still or we are still in that mode. Now granted food service sales are not quite as good, especially in that mid-scale, and casual like we talked about, but QSR is still very good, and retail has really picked up the pace here. So there's been a shift, and we've acknowledged that shift, but overall I would tell you that from a Tyson perspective demand for chicken, domestically, is still pretty good.\nKenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets\nSo you have still no intention of kind of cutting a little bit?\nDennis Leatherby\nWhat I'm telling you is that we will continue to evaluate this and we do continue to evaluate it all the time. As of right now, we still believe that demand supply balance for us is still reasonably good.\nKenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets\nOkay. If I think about on the beef side, I may guess, I am going to have the similar logic here. With the beef export probably coming down, we noted a little bit tighter supply. You guys have made some actions with Emporia. Is there a need for another action either by the industry or by Tyson?\nDennis Leatherby\nWell, I can tell you there will not be another action by Tyson. We have very, very, efficient plants. We are pleased with our position there. I don't necessarily know that exports, our export business is still solid from a beef standpoint. Japan still isn't where we wanted it to be, but that's because of the 20 month in down process. \nLike I said, we booked thousand, 250 containers into South Korea. We still see demand being reasonably good from an export perspective, and as I said, I do belief cattle supplies are going to be down, but they are still up about 4/10 of a percent year-over-year in '08. So I don\u2019t think we are going to have a huge shortfall of cattle in order to keep our plants running efficiently to generate reasonable margins for '09.\nKenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets\nSo you did say that, when you say you are confident in your beef positioning, that is an implication that you expect to making money in beef in 2009. Is that fair?\nDennis Leatherby\nAbsolutely.\nKenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets\nOkay. Great, I appreciate it.\nDennis Leatherby\nThanks.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow - Credit Suisse\nHi. Thank you.\nDennis Leatherby\nGood morning, Rob.\nRobert Moskow - Credit Suisse\nGood morning. Can you give me, you have $250 million of cash on your balance sheet now. Is that going to be directed towards acquisition? What should we expect your debt levels to be say six months from now? \nThen secondly, can you help me separate the currency impact on exports from the tight credit environment presumably the tight credit environment can go away, but our protein is not as good of a relative value as it used to be for these export markets. So do you think that that has the risk of having a more permanent impact on our export ability?\nDennis Leatherby\nSure, Robert this is Dennis. I'll handle the first part. As far as the cash goes, the $250 million in cash is being used to invest in our business, and as Dick said earlier we invested $80 million in Brazil and have more spending on the way between CapEx internationally and also in China with Shandong Xinchangn. \nSo it will be certainly invested back in the business. As far as debt goes, debt will go up because of the some of these same investments, but also because this GO Zone financing that we did with dynamic fuels, it's a 50-50 joint venture and because we put the credit support behind it that debt will show up as well. That's $100 million. So it will go up some.\nRobert Moskow - Credit Suisse\nOkay. \nDick Bond\nRob, on the export side, I do believe that the credit issues probably will go away. I don't know whether that's two months, four months, six months, but it probably is more of a short-term issue, and I would say for us and our customers, it has been less of an issue maybe than others. \nI'm not sure about that. I think the fact that the dollar has gotten stronger is certainly something that we are going to have to deal with, but if you think about areas of where protein can come from, and you think about high quality beef and you think about high quality pork, the US is going to be still the low cost producer on the beef and the pork side even with that change. \nSo, I still see that being positive for us. The EU and other parts of the world can't create pork nearly as efficiently as we can. China has to use most, all of its support to feed its own people. So I think even though the currency and the value of the dollar has increased, on the beef and pork side, I still think we'll be the most favored nation if you will to help handle that desire for protein. \nOn the chicken side, we really have to make sure that we stay as competitive as we possibly can with Brazil. I mean that's the other area that we are going to always have to compete with, and while yes, the dollar has gotten stronger. \nI still believe that because based on the fundamental demand for protein, the fundamental demand for chicken first because it converts feed better than the cattle or the hogs do. There is going to be demand for chicken, that there's going to be enough demand there, once some of these issues in the short-term stabilize for both the US and Brazil to continue to grow from an export perspective.\nRobert Moskow - Credit Suisse\nWhat is it about our relative ability versus Brazil to make beef and pork sustainably more cost effective? Is it just we have a more professionalized method for slaughter and for raising?\nDick Bond\nNo actually that we produce a totally different product than what Brazil does. Brazil is primarily grass fed. In other words it's not grain fed, or if it is grain fed, it's an extremely short fed grain process. \nI mean, really the US and Canada and to some degree Australia and New Zealand are the only areas that produce high quality grain fed beef and the Australian dollar has probably had as much strengthening as the US dollar. So from a beef perspective, we still are very competitive on a high quality grain fed product, which is the product that we produce as far as Tyson Foods is concerned.\nRobert Moskow - Credit Suisse\nBut internationally do you see increase demand for grass fed beef?\nDick Bond\nActually, there has been increase demand, but there has also been increased demand for grain fed. If we can sometime in this next calendar year get Japan back up to a level of months higher than 20 months, either 30 months or all ages of cattle, it will dramatically change our beef exports to Asia as well. So I think there will be a continued need for high quality grain fed beef around the world.\nRobert Moskow - Credit Suisse\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Tim Ramey with D. A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nDennis Leatherby\nGood morning, Tim.\nTimothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co\nGood morning. Dick in the last five or ten minutes, since you were talking to Ken Goldman, the stocks declined about 12%. I'm going to give you chance to rethink the answer you gave Ken. You said that demand was good for chicken, and I think the market just is not real pleased with that answer. Demand will be really good for dollars if you agree to sell them for $0.90 too. I mean you have got to take the point of view that demand is horrible. You are losing huge money. What are we missing here?\nDick Bond\nWell, I would tell you that as a company we are not building inventory, we are selling product week in and week out. Yes, prices are not where we would want them to be, but I would still contend that on the food service side, not counting casual and on the retail side, we are continuing to see strong demand for chicken. I mean, it is the best converter of feed. \nPeople are still eating protein, Tim, and it is a matter of time before this balance, if you will, of supply and price gets back in line. That might take another quarter. It might take another two quarters. \nBut I believe that we are doing and we have done our part in the past. If you say the industry is now down on a hedge slaughtered basis in that 6% to 7%, we took more than that out in the last three or four years. \nSo we've continued to do our part, and I think our plants and the efficiency of what we are doing day in and day out to improve our operations, I believe that the demand is there, and we are staying with the program that we are on. Now, I also said that we would continue to evaluate this on a very, very timely week to week basis, and we will do that.\nTimothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co\nWell Dick, a year ago you talked about price encourage, then when I was out with Donnie Smith four five months ago, you guys talked about well we're not going to be the one to cut. \nI don't know what kind of stock price is going to take get to change of heart, but let's just face it. This is not good profitability. Demand is not good. Demand, you are giving away dollars for $0.90, and I think we are going to have to take a hard look at that. That's my comment. Thanks.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Christine McCracken with Cleveland research. Your line is open.\nChristine McCracken - Cleveland Research \nYes. Good morning.\nDennis Leatherby\nGood morning Christine.\nChristine McCracken - Cleveland Research \nJust in terms of demand, if you look at kind of flash forward some months and look at the type of pricing you are going to need to get back to profitability in chicken, and then what the produce is on the hog side and what to your guess, are you going to need to get back to kind of better results?\nYou look at the current environment at current pricing and you say that demand is good, but that's at today's price. I guess I'm wondering how you look at demand at the pricing you need to restore profitability say in some months both here in the US and then how it's going to put us in even greater disadvantage in the export markets. How do you look at that scenario?\nDennis Leatherby\nWell, Christina, I look at that and say that prices right now, if you take leg quarters and what has happened to leg quarters, you go back to six weeks ago and leg quarters were in the high 50s and they had built to that level all year long. Quite frankly, we have got mostly trade disruption, not demand that has caused that significant decline in terms of leg quarter values. \nIt's really hard to say what kind of prices are going to be necessary, because there's so much volatility on the input side, that it's very difficult to determine what prices we are going to have to have, but I still contend that demand for chicken will remain good both domestically and will improve again from an export perspective as we see the continuing need for more protein primarily driven by chicken. You are right. I mean, nobody likes selling prices where they are today. \nBut, ultimately this will not go on. It cannot go on forever. So there will be a time where these prices will materially rise, and that time frame is not years away, it's months away. Whether it's this quarter or next quarter or whether it has to wait till April or May, it is going to happen. \nOne of the advantages that we have is we are a multi-protein company, and I still believe as I've said that our pork business will have a solid performance all next year. Our beef business will be profitable. We have a strong balance sheet, and I think we have solid, solid ideas of what we want to do and how we want to accomplish it.\nChristine McCracken - Cleveland Research\nAll right. Just in terms of the export situation, you know, you see now several weeks of disruptions tied to some of these events that you talked about relative to credit specifically with Russia. I think and now you've seen there is kind of disruption with Russia on the leg quarters situation. Inventories are building or have built for weeks now and historically when this has happened in one protein, we have had a huge kind of lag and how long it takes to work through that inventory? \nI'm wondering, if I'm looking at all three proteins now, not moving specifically into Russia but also I've heard of significant disruption into Mexico, for example, and things slow into some of the Asian countries, it's going to take a long time to work through all this inventory. So, why are you so optimistic on fiscal '09? It just seems very unlikely that we'll be able to move through all that meat in a short period of time and get the pricing back so quickly?\nDennis Leatherby\nWell, I'm not sure, I can tell you that from an inventory perspective, probably we have seen a little bit of a build on the leg quarter, but that's not necessarily that they are not sold. It's more shipping and other disruption related activities, but we as a company are not building inventories on an overall basis. \nIn other words, we are not building inventories of frozen beef. We are not building inventories of frozen pork. We are not building inventories of frozen prepared foods and other then leg quarters, we're not building any inventory from a chicken perspective. \nSo, yes, maybe there is some building of inventories, but it is not occurring at Tyson Foods. So we have to look at it from the standpoint of how we look at these various markets, what we are being able to do domestically. I totally agree with you. We don't necessarily like the prices that we are selling at today, but I believe all those things are going to improve. As I've said, I mean it's our Q3 and Q4 that we believe will be significantly better. I've never said that we are going to have a great first half of the year that I am optimistic, very optimistic about the back half of the year not necessarily about the first half of the year and especially the first quarter.\nChristine McCracken - Cleveland Research\nAll right. I'll leave it there and follow up later. Thanks.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nVincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley\nHi. Good morning, everyone.\nDennis Leatherby\nGood morning.\nVincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley\nWell a lot of my questions has been answered. So, if you can just, Dick you talked about grain costs were up 600 and then total cost in chicken were up 900. Could you help us understand that other 300 and if, how much of that what isn't hedged, how much of that might have improved or should improve in fiscal '09 relative to fiscal '08?\nDennis Leatherby\nMost of that 300 is made up of other ingredients that are necessary more for the value added side of the chicken. We have breading. We have batters, we have cooking oils and those are the primary things that makeup that additional. \nWe use a lot of soybean oil and a lot of vegetable oil for our frying operations. So those are the types of things that I'm talking about in terms of other ingredients. We also had higher inputs in terms of energy, and those would be the main components of that $300 million.\nVincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley\nDirectionally, should you get some relief on that next year?\nDennis Leatherby\nWell, if energy prices were to stay where they are now, yes, we would definitely get some relief there, and we have seen declines in a lot of those other commodities. So it really depends upon what happens with the commodity markets. But, yes, there should be some significant savings over '08 if commodities in general were to stay kind of where they are at now.\nVincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley\nOkay. Then, if I can just ask, as we've all watched breast prices in leg quarter prices come down each week, how much of a surprise has that been? Can you characterize exactly what is causing the decline in breast meat prices and is there kind of a contagion between, now that leg quarters are going down, is that putting incremental pressure on breast meat prices as well?\nDennis Leatherby\nNot necessarily. I think that the leg quarter pricing has put incremental pressure on the breast meat prices, but the pure fact is that from an industry perspective, there is too much supply from a breast meat perspective. There's no doubt about that. From a leg quarter perspective, I believe this is more driven not again by demand, but by unique trade disputes which are hopefully going to be relatively short lived.\nVincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley\nOkay, and then just a last question. When I think about, when we think about your volume being up 6% in chicken, just help me understand any sort of fine print in that. Does that mean specifically you grew 6% more chickens in this quarter year-over-year? Was there something about last year's quarter that made the comparison easier or difficult or what have you? How should we think about that number in the face of the current state of the chicken industry?\nDennis Leatherby\nOur volume, not in terms of head but in terms of pounds was up 6% year-over-year. Part of that is in bird weight because in overall we have increased our bird weight as we have gone to as I said earlier, a few plants in larger bird weight. \nPlus I will also tell you that in fourth quarter, the conversion and the growing activity because of the weather not being quite as hot as typically in the South, especially during August and September, we actually processed more chicken in that quarter and processed some birds early because of the very good efficiencies and gains that we actually ran a few Saturdays, which in Q4 of '07 we didn't.\nVincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley\nOkay. I guess lastly, is that the type of volume that we should expect in fiscal '09?\nDennis Leatherby\nIn terms of year-over-year increases?\nVincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley\nYes.\nDennis Leatherby\nNo, no.\nVincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley\nIt will be more flat or --\nDennis Leatherby\nYes. Should be roughly flat.\nVincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley\nThank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.\nFarha Aslam - Stephens Inc.\n\nGood morning.\nDennis Leatherby\nGood morning.\nFarha Aslam - Stephens Inc.\n\nHi. Just continuing on the export, could you share with us how current bookings, I know you booked beef into South Korea quite good. Kind of looking forward as you are looking at forward bookings for beef, are you still seeing the same level of demand as you are expressing that's been booked to date and how much is that demand for beef weakened?\nDennis Leatherby\nI would tell you, I think that we did get a very, very strong pipeline filled out of South Korea. I think probably short-term demand there will probably get just a little bit softer, and we won't see that same level again because of the very, very strong pipeline filled, and we still haven't seen the retail side of South Korea be as aggressive with US beef and we are working with USMEF and our retail partners over there to try and get more US beef reestablished in South Korea. So in all honesty in the short-term, I think we could see a little bit of a pull back from South Korean perspective, but I still believe long-term South Korea will be a very, very strong market for us, once we get through and we get retail totally reestablished in South Korea.\nFarha Aslam - Stephens Inc.\n\nOver the next three to six months looking at just Tyson's beef business, where do you think exports are going to be year-over-year?\nDennis Leatherby\nIt's a good question. I think probably from a dollars perspective, they'll probably be higher. I think from a volume perspective because we will have South Korea in there where we didn't have South Korea in there last year will be higher on a volume perspective as well. I'm not sure I can give you a number as to what percentage that is in the plan, because I don't know that off the top of my head.\nFarha Aslam - Stephens Inc.\n\nOkay. Following on to Christine's question about pork exports, Tyson's pork export kind of looking forward in the next three months and the next six months, if you could just kind of give us some color about Tyson's export on that front.\nDennis Leatherby\nI think our exports will be very strong to Japan. I think we will continue to have strong exports into Mexico. Russia again might be an issue here in the short-term, but by and large I think the majority of our export markets will continue to be good as the EU continues to decline and Canada continues to decline from availability and a sow herd, I still think that US pork will be in demand around the world.\nFarha Aslam - Stephens Inc.\n\nSo, you expect volumes to be up in the next six months for Tyson foods and pork, 3 to 6 months?\nDennis Leatherby\nWe were up hugely in '08 over '07. But, I would not tell you that we're going to be up significantly in '09 compared to '08. I still think we should be up slightly, but I don't think we'll be up like we were up in '08.\nFarha Aslam - Stephens Inc.\n\nBut I'm just trying to get the near term trends, our near terms are you seeing it weakened and softened the amount that's going overseas?\nDennis Leatherby\nActually the amount that's being totally exported from a pork perspective, we are not seeing an overall decline at this point.\nFarha Aslam - Stephens Inc.\n\nOkay. Then, you've discussed the weakness in chicken. Where do you think leg quarters will bottom, and what are the factors that will allow it, that gives you confidence that that's the price that they will bottom in at?\nDennis Leatherby\nI would tell you we are pretty close to the bottom.\nFarha Aslam - Stephens Inc.\n\nSo you are thinking the mid-teens is bottom?\nDennis Leatherby\nWell I think mid to high teens is probably the bottom. You get much below that, you might just as well render it. So, yes. I think that is the bottom, and I think as soon as we get a satisfactory resolution in Russia, that will help, and I think hopefully that will be fourth coming. I know there are meetings later this week between USTR, USDA and the Russian government and hopefully the quota in these other trade technical issues will get resolved, and that will start back that process of rebuilding both demand and pricing from a leg quarter perspective.\nFarha Aslam - Stephens Inc.\n\nSo you anticipate leg quarters will start recovering in this January period or do you think it's going to be more the March period?\nDennis Leatherby\nProbably later, probably later in calendar first quarter would be my guess.\nFarha Aslam - Stephens Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Diane Geissler with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nDiane Geissler - Merrill Lynch\nGood morning.\nDennis Leatherby\nGood morning, Diane.\nDiane Geissler - Merrill Lynch\nDick could you just tell me how many more quarters of losses in chicken are you comfortable with before you actually do something about your production levels? How many more quarters are you willing to lose money in chicken?\nDennis Leatherby\nWell, I've told you we would most likely lose money in Q1. If leg quarters don't improve till late March or sometime in the latter part of our fiscal Q2, whether that be late February or March, we could very well have a loss quarter in terms of our second quarter as well in chicken. I don't believe we will have a quarter beyond that. I think our third quarter or the calendar quarter of April through June will be profitable.\nDiane Geissler - Merrill Lynch\nSo, even with two potential loss quarters coming up, you still feel that your production level is appropriate?\nDennis Leatherby\nDiane I said we would continue to look at that week in and week out, and we won't lose sight of that. But I'll still stand with my thought process that we are seeing what we are seeing from a demand and from a customer perspective and we are going to stay in that mode.\nDiane Geissler - Merrill Lynch\nOkay. Well, I guess I struggle with your comments earlier where you say it has to get better, just has to because we can't keep going on as an industry this way. These types of comments and I guess my question is why does it have to get better if the number two chicken player, which has a quarter of the market isn't doing anything to reduce supply.\nDennis Leatherby\nWell, I mean, I think as we always look at what happens come spring, demand as we get to the grilling season for chicken breast and what have you always improves. Again I think QSR continues to be good. I think you will see QSR continue to promote chicken. As I've said, I think the export markets will get better, once we get through the mid to late winter, and I'm not sure what capacity will either come out or not come out in the chicken industry between now and then.\nDiane Geissler - Merrill Lynch\nOkay. I guess my other question is really about the language in your segment reporting regarding your grain hedging. You've changed some of the language. I'm reading this as boiler plate because it's in all of your new segments with regard to these net gains exclude the impact from related fiscal purchase transactions, which will impact future period operating results. Is there something there that we should sort of change in accounting?\nDennis Leatherby\nThere's no change. Actually I think that language has been in there the last three or four quarters. I don't believe that language is any different.\nDiane Geissler - Merrill Lynch\nOkay. I check your last quarter and it wasn't there. So I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't reading more into that than I should?\nDennis Leatherby\nNo.\nDiane Geissler - Merrill Lynch\nOkay. Thank you.\nDennis Leatherby\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Christopher Brocklehurst with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nGood morning.\nDennis Leatherby\nGood morning, Chris.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nJust a quick question on the $160 million of hedging gains in the quarter. Of those, is there a certain portion that's mark-to-market and therefore should be excluded from the calculation for the leverage ratio covenant?\nDick Bond\nYes. There would be some.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nCan you\u2026 \nDick Bond\nChris, I'm not sure how much that is. We can probably follow up and get you a better determinant of that.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nIs it fair to assume that we were supposed to exclude a large enough chunk in that mark-to-market to the point where it would put you over the threshold for the covenant that that would be disclosed in your commentary or in your press release this morning?\nDick Bond\nWell remember Christina or Heather was asking about where we came in on the covenant and she said 310. I said it's more like 320. So that would factor all of that in Chris.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nSo that calculation that includes all of the $161 million of hedging gains in the quarter?\nDick Bond\nChris, I'm looking at our press release and don't see where it says 161. I see that we said partially offset by net gains of 78 for the quarter and 127 for the year. So that's year-over-year change.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nWhen you referred to, so in each of the segments I guess there was $78 million in chicken or this $77 million in beef, I guess the line with operating results would positively impact in the fourth quarter by net gains of $77 million from a commodity risk management activities? Is that separate from hedging?\nDennis Leatherby\nNo. That would be inclusive in there. What we haven\u2019t broke out there specifically, what is mark-to-market would be excluded from the covenants, but I can tell you matter of factly that that number was not that large that the add back is what kept us under the covenant. So we weren't close to getting anywhere near our covenant on our debt to EBITDA covenant.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nGot it. So, excluding mark-to-market you did not reach that threshold?\nDick Bond\nNo.\nDennis Leatherby\nNo were near.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nOkay. Then, as you mentioned it may be tight looking out to 1Q '09. So, I guess I'm curious if you've received explicit assurances from your lenders that if you were to trip that covenant that you would receive leniency or your commentary seems pretty optimistic, but is that just based on having a good relationship in general or is that something that you've received sort of explicit assurances on?\nDennis Leatherby\nWe have not received explicit assurances but it's really based on great historical relationships and also we keep our banks well informed where we are especially our key banks.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nOkay. Then, if I think about just the sort of the events right now transpiring in the industry or that may transpire, if there were to be a fairly significant process or filing for bankruptcy I'm just wondering would that have positive implications for Tyson because it will allow capacity to come out of the industry potentially or would it be more maybe near term negative because it would force liquidation of inventory at fairly cheap prices? I'm just wondering how we should look at the positives or negatives of such an event?\nDennis Leatherby\nI really don't have any comment one way or the other and it would be wrong for me to have any comment. So I'm going to pass on that question.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nOkay. In chicken, are you right now on a more of a variable margin basis? Are you profitable at least on a variable margin basis, or losing money on that basis as well?\nDennis Leatherby\nWe are profitable in a couple of our divisions not in all of them, but we are close.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nSo, is it fair then to assume the more commodity oriented divisions is where the profit, the variable contribution has been squeezed more?\nDennis Leatherby\nYes.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nThen I'm thinking just, so it seems like if you are not profitable on a variable contribution margin basis, then the easy decision would be not to produce more of what you are losing money on every time you produce it. So I guess why would you accept losing money on commodity items?\nDennis Leatherby\nAgain that would not necessarily have been true until this very, very rapid decline in leg quarter values, and that's something that is relatively new here in the last couple of three weeks, and Dennis said that overall we were profitable on a variable cost basis, and yes, there is a small portion that might not be, but by eliminating or reducing capacity, you can't just reduce capacity on a commodity basis because that's not how our business works. All of our plants do some level of value added activity as well.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nSo, if the net of the value added activity is negative in that sort of scenario where that commodity business is losing money on a variable margin basis, and you expect that the near term, very near term could remain challenged and you are fairly close or at least tight anyway when it comes to the covenant threshold, why continue to produce near term? Given that it's only 6 to 7 week life cycle or 8 to 10 forward looking production management decision?\nDennis Leatherby\nAgain, as I've said, you can't look at a chicken and say this whole chicken is a commodity chicken because as an example we are further processing and doing a lot of work on wings and on tenders, chopped and formed products, so you need a number of parts of this chicken for value added activities, which are more than contributing at a variable cost level. So you really have to look at it in its entirety, and as I've said, we will continue to monitor our production levels based on the demand from our customers.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nOkay. So if Tyson were to cut production, you'd be disadvantaging the cost structure of some of your more value added businesses. So the net of Tyson cutting production would be overall a negative for the segment then?\nDennis Leatherby\nFor our segment, yes.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nFor your chicken segment, if you were to cut production the net to profitability would be a negative impact overall?\nDennis Leatherby\nIn the short-term, absolutely.\nChristopher Brocklehurst - Barclays Capital\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur last question comes from Ann Gurkin with Davenport. Your line is open.\nAnn Gurkin - Davenport\nGood morning.\nDennis Leatherby\nGood morning Ann. \nAnn Gurkin - Davenport\nJust wanted to clarify something. Dick I think you talked about you are not seeing an inventory build right now despite the export situation in the chicken segment, but we are hearing that Tyson has been looking for freezer space and so I'm just curious if you can reconcile what we are hearing with your statement this morning.\nDick Bond\nI do say that because of shipping and disruptions to Russia that we were having a slight build on leg quarters, and I did acknowledge that, but I think that's a short-term issue. I'm not aware of us specifically looking for new or different cold storage or freezer activity, but you might know something that I don't. But I did acknowledge that we have had a slight increase. \nI would tell you it's all sold. It's just a matter of getting it shipped. A matter of getting our customers to make sure that they give us the dollars before we need to load the vessels. So some of that is more around logistics than it is not having the product sold.\nAnn Gurkin - Davenport\nOkay. Then, if we go back to, I guess when we went through an oversupply of chicken and demand was falling off and I seem to recall that one of the objective was really to keep the capacity open and could keep max market share in place. Are you meeting your objective, you now have three negative quarters in chicken, looking at maybe two more or who knows? Is it really meeting your objective?\nDennis Leatherby\nI think that we are meeting our objectives in terms of attempting to improve our business both from a value added standpoint and from optimizing our commodity business models. Those two strategies, I think we are making a lot of progress that I'm very proud of. \nThese benchmarking studies that we participate in will show us improving dramatically, and for that reason and that reason alone, we are very pleased with the changes and the progress that we are making in our chicken business.\nAnn Gurkin - Davenport\nEven though you are incurring tremendous losses?\nDennis Leatherby\nEven though we are incurring losses. That's correct.\nAnn Gurkin - Davenport\nAll right. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nWe have no further questions.\nDennis Leatherby\nWell, let me just conclude by saying it's evident that on the chicken side, you all think we should be cutting production. I will tell you, we will continue to monitor that, but I still believe that the improvements that we've put in place and what we are doing to match demand with supply is the right thing for Tyson Foods. \nI would also tell you that we are a diversified portfolio company in terms of participating in all three of the major proteins and believe that's a very imperative part of our overall company position. We have a strong balance sheet, and we will continue to be a leader in the protein industry and feel very confident about our future. I thank you for participating with us today and look forward to talking to you in the future. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.\n\n",

Hello and welcome to today\u2019s Tyler Technologies first quarter \u201808 earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Your host for today\u2019s call is John Marr, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. Mr. Marr, please begin your call.\nJohn Marr\nThank you, Jason and welcome to our first quarter 2008 earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First I would like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement then I\u2019ll have some preliminary comments, Brian will review the details of our operating results, then I\u2019ll have some final comments, then we\u2019ll take your questions. Brian.\nBrian Miller\nThank you, John. During this course of the conference call management may make statements that provide information other than historical information that may include projections concerning the company\u2019s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profit. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. John.\nJohn Marr\nThanks, Brian. The first quarter of 2008 marks Tyler\u2019s 28th consecutive profitable quarter. Overall results for Q1 were in line with our expectations for revenues and margin growth. Organic growth continues to be in double-digits and was supplemented by recent acquisitions. We also saw solid growth in software services and maintenance. Free cash flow was $16.9 million, exceptionally strong. To be at this level there were contributions from throughout our business. But in particular it was driven by favorable billing terms on certain large contracts. We continue to invest in growth with increased research and development spending on our new Microsoft Dynamics Development effort as well as other new and existing product development efforts.\nEven after investing more than $24 million in cash in acquisitions in the repurchase of our own stock during the period, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $46 million in cash and investments, providing Tyler a high degree of financial flexibility. The acquisitions of Versatran, Schoolmaster and ASP also closed since the first quarter of last year, resulted in 5.6% revenue growth, break-even GAAP earnings and positive EBITDA and free cash flow. Now I would like for Brian to offer some comments on the details of the financial statements. Brian.\nBrian Miller\nThanks, John. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the quarter ended March\u00a031st,\u00a02008. For the first quarter of 2008 Tyler had revenues of $59.4 million, up 17.9% from the first quarter of 2007. Our organic revenue growth for the quarter was 12.3% and acquisitions since March 31st of 2007 accounted for 5.6% of our revenue increase. Operating income was $4.7 million, up 34.3% from $3.5 million for the first quarter of last year. \nNet income for the quarter increased 30.2% to $3.1 million or 8 cents per diluted share compared to net income of $2.4 million or 6 cents per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007. Free cash flow was exceptionally strong in the first quarter. Cash flow from operations was $17.8 million for the first quarter compared to $6.9 million a year ago. Free cash flow was $16.9 million; nearly triple the $6.1\u00a0free cash flow for the first quarter of last year.\nThe increase in free cash flow was primarily driven by an increase in deferred revenues resulting from cash received from advance payments ahead of revenue recognition on certain large contracts which have favorable billing terms. While we have revised our annual guidance for free cash flows modestly, the timing of cash flows can be difficult to predict, particularly from quarter to quarter.\nEBITDA for the first quarter of 2008 was $7.6 million compared to $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2007. A reconciliation of GAAP income to EBITDA is included in our earnings release.  \nOur software-related revenues, which includes software licenses, subscriptions, software services and maintenance increased in the aggregate 23.1% over the first quarter of 2007. Software license revenues increased 5.5% over last year`s first quarter. Software license revenue related to our financial management and education product, which comprised 71.1% of our software license revenues, increased 15% primarily due to revenue from student information and management solution and student transportation management solutions acquired in the last 12 months.\nQuartz and justice licenses increased 5% over last year`s first quarter. These increases were partially offset by a 32.4% decrease in appraisal and tax and other software licenses due in part to the deferral of software license revenue on a customer arrangement pending revised timelines for completion, as well as a small number of land records customers choosing our subscription-based options. \nSubscription revenues increased 45.4%, primarily due to the addition of new, larger ASP customers in the last half of 2007 as well as an increase in disaster recovery customers. \nDuring the first quarter we signed one new ASP customer, Westport Connecticut, for our financial management product and converted three existing MUNIS customers to our hosted offering. Software services were up 27.6% from last year`s first quarter and maintenance revenues grew 24.6% from the first quarter of 2007. \nAppraisal services revenues for the first quarter decreased 17.9% from the first quarter of `07, primarily because we substantially completed projects associated with the Ohio revaluation cycle as well as other appraisal contracts. We currently expect appraisal revenues for the full year 2008 to decline moderately compared to 2007. The revenue mix for the first quarter of 2008 was as follows. Software licenses 14%, subscriptions 5%, software services 28%, maintenance 42%, appraisal services 8%, and hardware and other 3%. \nFor the first quarter of 2007 the revenue mix was licenses 16%, subscriptions 4%, software services 26%, maintenance 40%, appraisal services 11%, and hardware and other 3%. Overall 89% of our revenue mix was software-related in the first quarter of `08, up from 86% in the first quarter of 2007.\nFor the first quarter of 2008, our overall gross margin improved 90 basis points to 36.7% compared to 35.8% in last year`s first quarter. Sequentially, gross margins decreased from 40.4% in the fourth quarter of `07. The increase in blended gross margin from last year`s first quarter was due to leverage and the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale as well as a revenue mix with less appraisal services revenue. \nThe sequential decrease in the blended gross margin from the fourth quarter of 2007 is primarily due to lower software license revenues in the mix for the first quarter of 2008, which is a typical seasonal trend. Software license margins for the quarter were down slightly from last year at 68.5% versus 70.3% last year. The decrease is primarily due to the license product mix this year that included more third-party software which has lower margins than our proprietary software.  \nThe blended margin for software services, maintenance and subscriptions increased to 31.8% from 29.9% for the same quarter last year and decreased sequentially from 35.1% in the fourth quarter of last year. The gross margin for appraisal services improved to 30.9% in the quarter from 28.4% in last year`s first quarter, primarily because of inclement weather in the first quarter of `07 which depressed productivity.\nSG&A expenses were 14.8 million for the first quarter of `08 compared to 13 million for the same period in `07. First quarter 2008 SG&A expenses improved to 24.9% of revenues compared to 25.8% in the same quarter last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues grew at a slower rate than revenues due to cost management and leverage in the utilization of our administrative and sales staff. SG&A expenses for the first quarter of `08 included $647,000 of share-based compensation expense versus $455,000 in the first quarter of `07. \nResearch and development expense increased 48.5% to $1.8 million in the first quarter, reflecting the development efforts under our new alliance with Microsoft as well as other new product development projects. Research and development expenses increased over the prior year period because staffing for the Microsoft development effort ramped up throughout 2007. R&D expense in the current quarter was offset by $130,000 in reimbursement earned from Microsoft under the terms of our agreement. \nYear over year backlog again grew faster than revenues, our backlog at March 31st, 2008 was $239 million, compared to $197.8 million at March 31st, 2007, an increase of 20.8% and down sequentially from $250.1\u00a0million at December 31st of 2007. Backlog related to our software business which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts was $214.5 million at March 31st, an increase of 39.1\u00a0million or 22.3% from March 31st of last year and a decrease of 8.1 million or 3.6% from December 31st. Appraisal services backlog was 24.5 million at March 31st, 2008 compared to 22.4 million at March\u00a031st, 2007 and 27.6 million at December 31st, 2007.\nDuring the first quarter we repurchased approximately 814,000 shares of our common stock on the open market at an average cost of approximately $12.92 per share. Our remaining authorization of shares that may be purchased currently totals 967,000 shares. Our CapEx during the first quarter was $891,000 with no capitalized software development. CapEx for the first quarter of last year was 766,000 and included 25,000 of capitalized software development costs. \nAlthough we continue to spend significant amounts on product development, we currently expect that capitalized software development will remain at low levels for the foreseeable future and that virtually all of our development costs in 2008 will be expenses, either as R&D expense or in cost of software services and maintenance revenue.\nAmortization of post-acquisition software development costs was 1.1 million in the first quarter, down from 1.2 million in last year\u2019s first quarter. Day sales outstanding and accounts receivable at March\u00a031st \u201808 were 90 days, compared to 95 days at December 31st of \u201807 and 84 days at March 31st 2007. December is one of the peaks of our annual maintenance billing cycles and DSOs  typically decline sequentially from Q4 to Q1 as we collect those receivables in the first quarter of each year.\nOur stockholders\u2019 equity at March 31st 2008 was 132.8 million. We continue to have no debt outstanding and ended the first quarter of 2008 with 46.1 million in cash and investments. Included in our investments are approximately $5.8 million of auction rate 16:52 security that has been classified as non-current on our March31st balance sheet. \nWe significantly reduced our investments in auction rate securities from 41.6 million at December 31st and have not taken an impairment charge related to these securities. Our current level of investment in auction rate securities is relatively insignificant in relation to our total cash and investments and we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these investments will affect our operations.\nThe first quarter results include the results of our two acquisitions in the quarter from their respective dates of acquisition. During the first quarter we completed the acquisition of all the capital stock of Versatran Solutions Inc. which develops and sells student transportation management software solutions for school districts and school transportation providers across North America, including solutions for school bus routing and planning, redistricting GPS fleet tracking, fleet maintenance and field trip planning. \nWe also purchased certain assets of Olympia Computing Company Inc. doing business as Schoolmaster which provides a full suite of student information systems. The combined purchase price excluding cash acquired and including transaction costs was approximately $13.9 million in cash and approximately 126,000 shares of Tyler common stock valued at $1.7\u00a0million. We have accounted for these acquisitions in the first quarter based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase prices which is subject to revision as the allocation is finalized. In connection with these acquisitions we reported $10.7 million of goodwill and $10.1 million of other intangible assets which are expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately 10 years.\nWe finished the quarter with 1784 employees, an increase of 157 over December 31st, of which 102 employees were added as a result of the first quarter acquisition. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to John for his comments.\nJohn Marr\nThanks Brian. The first quarter is traditionally slow in our industry as well as at Tyler and in relation to our 2008 this year\u2019s data consistent with that experience. However, this quarter demonstrated strong improvement in operating results from Q1 of last year with double-digit organic revenue growth, a 90 basis point increase in our gross margin in line with our expectations. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was down from prior year first quarter due to cost management and leverage and utilization of our administrative and sales staff and net income grew 30%. \nWith free cash flow of 16.9 million in the quarter we now have $41 million in free cash flow for the trailing 12 months. CapEx remains low although we continue to devote the same high-level of development resources to product enhancements in development and have increased our planned commitment to R&D for the remainder of 2008.\nVirtually all of these costs are now being expensed are included in our operating expense structure. Some of the contracts announced during the quarter were in our financial division Spring Branch in Humble, Texas, school districts for a combined value of 3.3 million, St. Louis County, Missouri with a contract value of 4.6 million and our Courts and Justice Division, Galveston County, Texas is a member county of the Conference for Urban Counties with a contract value of $2.7 million.\nIn appraisal services we signed a contract with the state of Tennessee.  Total contract value of 15.1 million.  For IAS World Property Tax software and related services we signed a contract with Bedford County, Pennsylvania.  Total contract value of 1.9 million for IAS World Property Assessment software and reappraisal services.\nFor financial management and education during the quarter we signed 24 different contracts with customers in 16 different states.  We continue to have very strong backlog even as we increase our capacity for delivery.  Total backlog increased from March of 2007 at a faster rate than revenues.\nLicense growth was only 6% and mostly from acquisitions.  But license growth is not linear and we do not expect \u2013 and we do expect healthy growth in licenses as the year progresses.  Overall we expect licenses for the year to grow at a rate equal to or greater than the overall growth rate for the company.  And as a result margins will expand as the year goes on.\nBy design we are seeing solid growth and recurring revenue maintenance with growth well in excess of our overall growth rate for the company.  As you have seen as a percentage of revenue, maintenance has grown from 40 to 42% year-over-year.  This combined with 5% subscription based revenue brings our recurring revenues to 47% of total.  And that is only for the contracted portion.  Considerably more revenue is derived from these customers for other services and products.\nAs we evaluate our market we are very aware of the broad economic weakness and in particular the pressure on real estate values and the decline of real estate related fees to local communities.  While there are some anecdotal signs of these issues effecting decisions in our space there really has been no fundamental change that we can see.  Our activity by all measures is relatively normal.  However, given the extent of these issues we will continue to monitor very closely.    \nCertainly we have seen these cycles before and we are fortunate to be in a market well insulated from cyclical pressures.  I\u2019m confident that we can make progress financially as a business as well as competitively and emerge from the cycle in a better position.\nOur guidance to 2008 remains largely unchanged with the exception of modest changes to free cash flow in our share account.  We expect diluted earnings per share of 49 to 53 cents.  For the year estimated pretax expenses of \u2013 related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan is expected to be $2.9 million or approximately 6 cents per share after taxes.\nWe estimate an effective tax rate of approximately 33% for 2008.  We\u2019ve modestly revised free cash flow for the year to 36 to 42 million with total CapEx approximately of 4.5 to 5.5 million for the year in total depreciation and amortization of approximately 12 million.  We have a modest revision in our share account based on our repurchases in the first quarter and now expect fully diluted shares to be 39.5 to 40 million.\nNow Jason will take questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you.  (Operator Instructions)  Our first question will come from Fred Buonocore with CJS Securities.\nFred Buonocore \u2013 CJS Securities\nHi gentlemen.  I\u2019m just calling in on behalf of Charlie Strauzer.  How are you today?\nJohn Marr\nDoing well.\nFred Buonocore \u2013 CJS Securities\n\nGreat.  So you\u2019re SG&A declined as a percentage of sales but it had a fairly significant dollar increase.  Can you talk about the actual dollar increase there I\u2019d assume largely related to acquisitions.  But can you dissect that a little bit for us?\nBrian Miller\nSure.  Of the SG&A increase a fair amount of it did come from acquisitions.  The acquisition impact is at about $1.6 million of SG&A expense.  And we also have modestly higher SG&A expense related to stock compensation.  That would be the other major impact there.\nFred Buonocore \u2013 CJS Securities\nGot it.  And then on gross margins in this seasonally weak quarter, would you say that this \u2013 that your performance actually exceeded what you\u2019d expected?  And can you kind of just talk a little bit more about the 90 basis point year-over-year improvement that you touched on in your prepared remarks?\nBrian Miller\nWell the improvement that I think we mentioned in the remarks is pretty much in line with our expectations for the quarter.  So generally not a big surprise there.  We\u2019ve expected modest improvement in the first quarter and as John mentioned as revenues \u2013 particularly license revenues grow through the year, we expect to see margins continue to improve throughout the year.\nFred Buonocore \u2013 CJS Securities\nExcellent, thank you.\nOperator\nThank you.  We\u2019ll now go to Kirk Materne with Banc of America Securities.\nKirk Materne \u2013 Banc of America Securities\nYes, thanks very much.  Brian, I guess R&D obviously ramped up year-over-year as you guys brought on guys to work on the Microsoft dynamics project.  Do you still have further people to bring on or is that going to grow sort of in line with revenues or is that going to be growing at a slower rate I guess in terms of absolute dollars?\nBrian Miller\n\nI think in terms of staffing we\u2019re generally staffed at \u2013 in the range of the level we expect to be throughout 2008.  There could be modest changes in it but we\u2019re generally ramped up to the point where we\u2019d be throughout the year.\nThe bigger impact on the net R&D expenses as we\u2019ve talked about last quarter, last couple of quarters we are receiving some reimbursement from Microsoft for part of the development expenses to the extent that they arrange with us to use some of the features that we\u2019re developing in their broader commercial product.\nThis quarter that reimbursement, it was recognized as only 130,000.  It was a fair amount more than that in the last two quarters and could vary from quarter to quarter.  We expect to continue to see reimbursement throughout the year but at this point we do not know exactly what that will be for the balance of the year.  So that also caused the net R&D expense to be a little higher this quarter because of the lower reimbursement.\nKirk Materne \u2013 Banc of America Securities\n\nOkay, thanks.  That\u2019s helpful.  And then John, I know you guys have been through a number of cycles like this, down cycles in the market.  Could you just talk a little bit about just sort of the deal closure process?  Is it different really in the state and local governments than it would be on sort of the commercial side?\nMeaning if commercial side everybody\u2019s pipeline looks great until you try to close the deal and there\u2019s another set of approvals that comes in and things might go through but they get delayed.  Do you see those type of delays in the state and local government?  Maybe not now but is that a risk and I guess just how should we view that?  Because that always seems to be the bigger issue with software.  If it\u2019s not the pipeline does not look good things start getting pushed out on a quarter by quarter basis.\nJohn Marr\n\nYes, well we\u2019re certainly watching it real closely.  I\u2019m only aware of a couple of deals in the last quarter or so that got late in the decision process that did not get finished.  And certainly we can look at those and be alarmed if we want them.  But the reality is that\u2019s pretty consistent with any tops.\nSo we\u2019re not seeing anything that\u2019s different.  And certainly we\u2019re getting asked that question a lot but the pipeline, the demo schedules, the RFT activity as well as decisions are all pretty normal and we are watching very closely to see if some of these deals get dropped as they go through the process.\nBut we have not been seeing that and have not really seen any signs of it.  It certainly is not a real robust market so when I mention the past, in my view it\u2019s an opportunity.  And we should be able to both perform financially during the period as well as improve our competitive position and some people with some lighter market share may find the market less attractive so we\u2019ll see.\nKirk Materne \u2013 Banc of America Securities\nOkay.  Great.  Thanks very much.\nOperator\nWe\u2019ll go now to David Yuschak with SMH Capital.\nDavid Yuschak \u2013 SMH Capital\nGreat quarter guys, great start to the year.  But one question I\u2019ve got for you guys, your backlog growth has really been as you said earlier, John, been above your revenue gains.  And probably from my point of view that backlog growth has been above where I thought your \u2013 even your long-term growth could be on revenue relative to the industry.\nI\u2019m just wondering if you can help us out.  Where are you seeing surprises to business being brought in?  Because I know you\u2019ve been working on getting that geographic expansion.  Is there any surprises that you\u2019re seeing where the penetration is coming maybe sooner or is this in product categories like maybe the schools because some of your recent acquisitions is gaining some traction and some of your additional customers are doing business with elsewhere?\nCan you guys kind of lay the land as to how that is developing so that you\u2019re turning in at kind of a good bookings rate?\nJohn Marr\nYes, well it\u2019s really across the board, David.  In the financial area which is the biggest part of our business, contracts tend to be going into backlog and staying there a little bit longer just based on the terms of the agreements and the accounting around them.  The business is in general the same but again I think contracts are \u2013 spend a little more time in backlog so it takes a little more time to run them through the financial statement.  So that\u2019s contributing something.\nAnd then the larger contracts that we\u2019re seeing in tax and appraisal and in courts and justice, they go into backlog as you know and those are generally multi-year agreements that are earned over a long period of time.  Obviously we have the Tennessee contract that\u2019s gone in there recently.  So it\u2019s really across the board.\nThere\u2019d be large contracts that stay in there for some time.  The larger tax and appraisal contracts, the courts and justice contracts and then again contracts in the past that maybe some of the more routine financial deals very quickly move from contracts through the financial statement.\nSome of them are larger, they\u2019re more complex and based on the accounting requirements as well as the terms of the agreements, they\u2019re spending a little more time in backlog.\nDavid Yuschak \u2013 SMH Capital\nBut are you seeing any positives out of your geographic expansion that you may not have \u2013\nJohn Marr\nNo question.  I mean, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress geographically.  We\u2019ve said that for a number of years now.  I think most of our product sets we now continue to be national products with either a primary or secondary presence in all the markets across the country.\nSo that\u2019s really where we\u2019ve had the most success over the last three or four years really.  And again have our sales force spread out throughout the country; have a much larger presence in a number of these different marketplaces.\nBut I think more recently in the last year it would be starting to have more success in the larger contracts.  Again, you look at the Tennessee contract, the number of large courts and justice contracts and we do not do a lot of $10 million financial contracts but there certainly are a lot more $2, $3, $4 million contracts in that space as well.\nDavid Yuschak \u2013 SMH Capital\nAnd then finally on this sales initiative, as you get closer to when Microsoft products begin to roll out, do you see anything changing in the way you maybe accelerate your field sales effort to bring in additional sales to capitalize on that particular initiative as well?\nJohn Marr\nWell I think it\u2019ll be maybe a redeployment in our direct effort and maybe growth somewhat about the way we\u2019ve grown that channel historically.  I\u2019d expect some increase in capacity there.  But really just maybe a change in the way we\u2019re proposing different applications in the direct space.\nWe will have probably kind of a secondary small channel but a number of resources we currently do not have that will exist to support the Microsoft business partners and their channel.  So I expect that on a direct basis this will be a good supplement and allow us to achieve higher growth rates on direct basis which is really our current business.  And it\u2019ll be entirely new business, what we\u2019ll see throughout the indirect channel or through the Microsoft business partners that sell into other markets.\nAnd we\u2019ll need more of a marketing sales support group that has not existed historically.  We do have some people that are kind of transitioning over to that now where we\u2019re going to different shows and conferences and meeting these partners in anticipation of that.  But it\u2019s really a slice of certain people\u2019s responsibility now and eventually it\u2019ll be full-time responsibility for maybe a handful of people to start with.\nDavid Yuschak \u2013 SMH Capital\n\nIf I understand you, does that mean that there would be more like technical sales people for that channel?  Is that kind of what you\u2019re thinking of?\nJohn Marr\nIt would be a combination of product specialists or technical people.  But certainly sales and marketing people that support the process help educate partners around the world really on what the story is and how to position it and support those channels.  We have those people internally that certainly provide the different business points and guidance through our sales channel on ASP solutions, on positioning different products.  And we\u2019ll want to do that to enhance the indirect channel at Microsoft as well.\nDavid Yuschak \u2013 SMH Capital\n\nGreat, thanks a lot.\nOperator\nThank you.  (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go next to Brian Kinstlinger with Sidoti & Company.\nBrian Kinstlinger \u2013 Sidoti & Company\nHi guys.\nJohn Marr\nHey Brian.\nBrian Kinstlinger \u2013 Sidoti & Company\nFirst question of my two is not new information.  If I look at the K, your software license in justice was up 26% last year and MUNIS was down eight in education.  And then appraisal was down 21%.  I\u2019m curious in the first quarter if we\u2019re looking at similar trends; obviously criminal justice like you\u2019ve talked about is your biggest growth riburn [ph].\nIf those numbers you expect to change drastically this year, especially on the MUNIS side and what are the trends driving it if you will?\nJohn Marr\nI do not think we\u2019ll see a drastic change.  I think MUNIS for the year last year was pretty strong.  And we\u2019re looking for modest growth in the MUNIS licenses for this particular year.  Courts and justice we would look for more significant growth.  They really had some timing issues in the first quarter and we would look for them to have higher license revenues for the next two quarters.\nBrian Kinstlinger \u2013 Sidoti & Company\n\nOkay, in follow up on the software license, when you look at your pipeline backlog or whatever you\u2019re looking at for the remainder of the year how do you get a sense of the combination of third party related software that you\u2019re going to deliver versus proprietary?  And what\u2019s your sense going forward based on what you see if there is visibility at all to that?\nBrian Miller\nWell some of that mix can bounce around quite a bit from quarter to quarter.  The timing at some of the third party renewals and the mix in a particular contract of how much is third party license versus our proprietary license does bounce around a bit.  But it stays generally in the 10 to 15% of the total license revenues are third party and generally 85 to 90% are proprietary licenses.\nAnd we expect to be in that range over the course of the full year.  But as it bounces around from quarter to quarter based on specific contracts it can have a modest effect on our overall gross margin because the margins on the third party tends to be under 20% and the license on our \u2013 or the margin on our proprietary licenses tends to be north of 80%.\nBrian Kinstlinger \u2013 Sidoti & Company\nSo it\u2019s choppy is what you\u2019re saying?\nBrian Miller\nYes, a little choppy.  Yes.\nBrian Kinstlinger \u2013 Sidoti & Company\nMy last question if I might, because I do not think I\u2019m the last person in the queue, is you grew 5% in this quarter and 11 last and obviously we know before that was a little tougher and I\u2019m just curious based on talking about no drastic change in the trends from last year how your guidance \u2013 what it implies for software revenue.  Is it an acceleration from where at 5% or is it you\u2019re thinking the 5% range with services growing much faster?\nBrian Miller\nIt\u2019s definitely acceleration.  I think John mentioned in his comments that we expect that for the full year that license growth would be in line with or slightly above our overall revenue growth.  And we\u2019ve given that top-line growth including acquisitions as being in the kind of upper teens to 20% range.\nSo clearly we expect an acceleration in the second \u2013 or in the last three quarters of the year.  Part of that comes from some of the things that John mentioned in terms of some of the timing, some of the contracts that \u2013 particularly in courts and justice and tax that have acceleration in the percentage of completion recognition as we move through the year or as we achieve certain milestones that allow us to recognize more revenues on those.\nAnd then in the areas where we recognize revenues more on delivery of the software and primarily in financial we would also expect as we typically have in prior years to see sequential increases throughout the year and the license revenues on those.\nBrian Kinstlinger \u2013 Sidoti & Company\n\nBut you do not year over \u2013 just so I understand \u2013 year over year you\u2019re expecting mid to high teens which is based on your overall revenue.  But that\u2019s what you\u2019re expecting on the software license line specifically?\nJohn Marr\nThat\u2019s right.\nBrian Kinstlinger \u2013 Sidoti & Company\n\nWow, okay.  Great.  Thanks.\nOperator\nAnd at this time there appears to be no more questions.  Mr. Marr I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nJohn Marr\nOkay, well thank you Jason.  We appreciate all of you joining us on the call today.  If there are any further questions feel free to contact Brian or myself.  Thanks again.  Have a good day.\nOperator\nThis does conclude today\u2019s teleconference; you may now disconnect and have a nice day.\n\n",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\nArvind Sood\nErica, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our Q1 call. I think the 2 key themes for this quarter are continued focus on volume-driven growth and pipeline advancement. Lots to cover, but we\u2019ll do our best to stick an efficient format of limited prepared comments and addressing your one best question.\nSo slides have been posted. Just a quick reminder, that we\u2019ll use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation. And some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to different materially.\nSo, with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob?\nRobert Bradway\nOkay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We had a busy start to 2021 and a first quarter that\u2019s something of a mirror image to what we experienced a year ago.\nLast year, if you recall, we came out of the gate with a very strong January and February, and then started to really feel the impact of the pandemic in March. This year, especially in the U.S. it was almost the reverse. We felt the impact of the pandemic in January and February, and we began to see a recovery in March, a trend that seems to be holding in April as well.\nSetting aside the pandemic, we executed effectively in the first quarter and this is reflected in the strong competitive performance of our brands globally. Our strong biosimilar is showing the rapid progress of our lead pipeline molecules and the addition of an attractive Phase-3-ready molecule in oncology.\nAltogether, we remain confident in our full year outlook. We\u2019re fortunate to have a diverse portfolio of newer products that continue to show strong volume growth. Repatha, for example, delivered 36% volume growth in the first quarter. It remains the clear leader of the PCSK9 market globally, and will soon reach the milestone of 1 million patients served.\nWe\u2019re also the global leader in bone health with Prolia and of Evenity generating double-digit volume in the quarter. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is annualizing above the $2 billion mark. And I would remind you that we have 3 additional biosimilars in Phase 3 development and look forward to a flow of new launch opportunities for these and AMGEVITA over the next few years.\nAs we\u2019ve shared with you many times in the past, we\u2019re active in business development, looking to complement our internally developed innovation with compelling external opportunities. And our recent acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics is a good example of that.\nAs you know, one of the molecules we acquired in that deal, bemarituzumab was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA as a first-line therapy for a subset of patients with gastric cancer. More than 1 million new gastric cancer cases are diagnosed annually. And the disease is particularly prevalent in the Asia Pacific region, which we\u2019ve said previously will account for approximately 25% of our growth over the next decade.\nBemarituzumab is now our third late-stage clinical medicine to be granted Breakthrough Therapy status, joining sotorasib, for which the trade-name LUMAKRAS has now been provisionally approved for use in the U.S. and tezepelumab also has earned that Breakthrough Therapy distinction.\nWith a strong balance sheet, healthy cash flows and our proven ability to integrate, we\u2019ll continue to look for external opportunities that strengthen us in our stated areas of focus. Before I turn things over to our CFO, Peter Griffith, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering results for our stakeholders.\nI look forward to our Q&A session a little later in our call. But for now, over to you, Peter.\nPeter Griffith\nThank you, Bob. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on the strong fundamentals of the business and further to reaffirm our full-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Let me first confirm our predictable consistent capital allocation hierarchy as seen in our Q1 activity.\nIt always begins with investing in internal innovation. LUMAKRAS and tezepelumab, both internally discovered, and each granted Breakthrough Therapy designation, are excellent examples of this. We also patiently pursue external business development opportunities that clear our hurdle rate and then are consistent with our areas of therapeutic focus, in which we are confident of integrating into Amgen efficiently and effectively on a timely basis.\nWe allocated $2 billion of our shareholders\u2019 capital to the Five Prime acquisition in the second quarter and have committed additional R&D funding to pursue other indications for the lead molecule bema.\nOur capital expenditures remain a high priority, including investments in our industry-leading protein manufacturing, our ESG initiatives including enabling carbon neutrality by 2027, and digitization imperatives.\nWe continue to return capital to our shareholders. First, we paid dividends of $1.76 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from 2020. This year marks our 11th year of dividends with meaningful increases in each of those years. Second, we repurchased 3.7 million shares in the first quarter at cost of roughly $865 million.\nFinally, our capital allocation hierarchy always builds on our efficient capital structure, which results in an optimal weighted average cost of capital.\nNow, I will briefly walk through our first quarter financial results. Recall that in 2021, we are now comparing to our recast 2020 results that exclude the impact of fair value adjustments to equity investments that were historically included in non-GAAP OI&E. In Q1, revenues decreased 4%.\nHistorically, first quarter sales have been the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year. As we entered 2021, we knew that COVID would likely introduce some variability. And as the quarter progressed and we saw a continuing cumulative effect of COVID cases on prescribing patterns, we anticipated that Q1 would be more negatively impacted, which led us to disclose in March that it would be moderately below 2020\u2019s percentage of the full year.\nFirst quarter sales benefited from 4% volume growth. Looking back to Q1 in 2020, we recorded approximately $150 million of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions, creating a negative impact on year-over-year growth comparisons in Q1 2021. As we get underway with the second quarter, we expect there to be some continuing cumulative COVID impacts.\nWhile we expect to see improvements in the rate of recovery, that recovery will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter increased 2% year-over-year.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Effective Q2 2021, cost of sales will increase as a percent of product sales in connection with our first shipments of antibodies to Lilly.\nRecall that revenue from shipments of these antibodies will be recorded in other revenues. For the full year, we expect R&D spend will increase as our innovative pipeline continues to progress, which now includes bema from the Five Prime acquisition as well as the Rodeo acquisition. And for the full year, we expect SG&A spend to decline. We continue our focus on digitization imperatives.\nNon-GAAP OI&E was a net $375 million expense in Q1. This is unfavorable by $79 million on a year-over-year basis, due to the recording of our portion of Beijing\u2019s loss this quarter. Recall the recognition of Beijing\u2019s results did not start until Q2 2020.\nThe effects year-over-year of the adjustments in sales deductions, combined with the recognition of the Beijing results, totaled about $0.29 in decreased EPS on a comparison basis for Q1 2021 and explain a large portion of the 12% decline in EPS year-over-year.\nNow, turning to the outlook for the business for 2021, based on underlying market dynamics and our investment plan, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance with a revenue range of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion, and a non-GAAP EPS range of $16 to $17.\nImportant additional points to consider, as you model the remainder of 2021. We are providing more specific quarter-over-quarter guidance, given the unprecedented continuing cumulative COVID impact on the operating environment. But we do not expect to provide such guidance on an ongoing basis.\nWe see the recovery from COVID-19 more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. And for the second quarter, we expect total revenues to grow between 7% and 10% sequentially from the first quarter.\nWe continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to increase by about 7% over last year, with an operating margin of roughly 50%, which includes operating expenses for Five Prime and Rodeo. Historically, the Q2 quarter-over-quarter operating expense increase is about 10%. But in the second quarter of this year, we expect quarter-over-quarter operating expenses to increase in the mid-teens percentage range, reflecting the impact of our Lilly COVID-19 antibody manufacturing agreement. Investments for growth including the Five Prime acquisition, as well as increasing activity levels, including launch preparation.\nFor the full year, we continue to anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be a net expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Our capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at $900 million. And based on our confidence in the long range outlook of the business, we are raising the upper end of our share repurchase range to $5 billion for 2021 versus prior guidance of $4 billion. So our range for share repurchases in 2021 is now $3 billion to $5 billion. Additionally, we\u2019re updating our non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 13.5% to 14.5% versus prior guidance of 13% to 14%.\nMy confidence is strong in the long-term outlook for Amgen, given the strength of the business, and the strength of our outstanding and dedicated team of 23,000-plus colleagues that deliver everyday to patients, and also deliver long-term growth to our shareholders.\nThis concludes the financial update. I\u2019ll turn it over to Murdo. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon\nThanks, Peter. First quarter product sales declined 5% year-over-year, volumes grew 4% driven by double-digit growth for a number of products, including Prolia, Repatha, MVASI, and KANJINTI. Net selling price declined 7% and the year-over-year comparison was negatively affected by 2% due to a benefit in Q1 2020 from approximately $150 million of changes to estimated sales deductions that did not reoccur to the same magnitude in Q1 of 2021.\nIn the first quarter, the cumulative effect of the COVID pandemic on missed patient visits and diagnoses impacted our business, January and February were clearly affected by post-holiday COVID spikes, and March showed demand improvement across most brands, which has continued into April. Despite the impact of the pandemic, our teams have found solutions to address the continuity of care, stabilizing our continuing patient volume.\nWe also saw improvement in customer facing execution throughout the quarter across all communication channels, including face-to-face and virtual activities. We expect some COVID-19 related disruptions still in the second quarter, the steady recovery thereafter. I\u2019ll now review some product details beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia grew 16% year-over-year, recording over $500 million of U.S. sales in the U.S. for the first time. As a majority of osteoporosis patients in the U.S. have been vaccinated and diagnosis rates are at approximately 90% to pre-COVID-19 levels. We\u2019re confident in Prolia\u2019s continued growth in 2021.\nEVENITY sales increased 7% year-over-year driven by strong volume growth, given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of postmenopausal women, if entity provides an excellent therapy to build bone first, which should then be followed by treatment with Prolia.\nRepatha sales increased 25% year-over-year to a quarterly sales record of $286 million driven by 36% volume growth and we maintain global leadership in the PCSK9 class. Sales outside the U.S. grew by 40% driven by strong patient demand. In the U.S., we continue to see strength in new patient starts with new-to-brand prescriptions growing 54% quarter-over-quarter helped by favorable pharmacy benefit manager formulary changes.\nU.S. volume growth demonstrates that we\u2019ve made good progress against our strategy to provide Repatha at an affordable price to patients, particularly those with Medicare Part D coverage. This acceleration in Medicare Part D growth has increased our exposure to the so called doughnut hole, which creates some negative impact on overall net price. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high risk cardiovascular patients.\nNext to Aimovig, which remains the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class; Aimovig volumes grew 20% year-over-year in the first quarter with a 45% average total prescription share and 38% average new-to-brand prescription share. Year-over-year net selling price declined primarily driven by increased rebates to maintain patient access. Unfortunately, millions of patients suffering from migraine are sub-optimally treated with older, less effective therapies. Given the head-to-head data, we\u2019ve generated showing Aimovig superiority against topiramate, we\u2019re confident we can help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine.\nTurning to our inflammation portfolio, where Otezla has demonstrated a robust safety and efficacy profile with over 6 years of real world experience in market with more than 500,000 patients treated globally. Enbrel similarly has served millions of patients globally since 1998. Otezla sales were $476 million in the quarter. Volume growth was 9% driven primarily by 11% total prescription growth in the U.S. Otezla remains the market leading brands and systemic medication for psoriasis with an approximately 30% share of first-line treatment. However, new-to-brand prescription volume remained flat as COVID-19 continued to suppress the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis patients.\nYear-over-year growth was also negatively impacted given pandemic-related inventory stocking in Q1 of 2020. Otezla has more than 90% commercial payer coverage in the U.S. without requiring a biological step, and is an affordable, safe and efficacious option for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We see attractive growth opportunities for Otezla as the pandemic recovery progresses. In addition, geographic expansion and the anticipated approval later this year of the mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication will contribute to future Otezla growth.\nIn 2021, year-over-year comparisons for Enbrel are adversely impacted by $255 million of favorable estimated sales deductions that were recorded in 2020, $115 million of which were in Q1 of 2020. In the quarter, Enbrel sales decreased 20% year-over-year with declines in both unit volume and net selling price. Moving forward, we expect volume and net price trends to continue. Parsabiv sales decreased 55% year-over-year driven by 65% volume decline. With Parsabiv\u2019s inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundled in the U.S., we have seen dialysis clinics quickly implement new treatment protocols, switching patients from Parsabiv to generic cinacalcet.\nSwitching to biosimilars, Q1 sales were $570 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe from AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, where we saw average shares of 50% and 43%, respectively in Q1.\nFor the remainder of the year, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition. Longer term growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products to new markets and launches of additional biosimilar molecules, such as AMGEVITA in the U.S., and biosimilars for SOLIRIS, STELARA and EYLEA.\nIn oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long acting G-CSF with 54% share of volume in the quarter. In Q1, we surpassed 1 million patients who with the help of Onpro were able to receive their G-CSF treatment, while reducing the need to return to their doctor\u2019s office or other site of care for administration. Consistent with recent trends, Neulasta\u2019s U.S. average selling price declined 30% on a year-over-year basis, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition.\nXGEVA sales decreased 3% year-over-year for the first quarter, as volume growth in Asia was offset by lower net selling price in that region. U.S. unit volumes declined year-over-year driven by demand impacts in January and February, with recovery beginning in March and into April. KYPROLIS sales decreased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter as the pandemic is suppressed the number of new patients starting treatment for multiple myeloma.\nMoving forward, we expect promotion to drive growth in second line and beyond as a result of our launch of the combination indication of KYPROLIS and DARZALEX plus dexamethasone or DKd. The combination of KYPROLIS with Sarclisa and dexamethasone, or Isa-Kd was also approved in the quarter. As Bob mentioned, our team is ready to launch sotorasib or LUMAKRAS upon approval, and we\u2019re excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. We\u2019ve already launched our biomarker assist program, which removes access barriers to testing and helps appropriate patients with out of pocket costs.\nAnd we\u2019re also preparing for the launch of Tezepelumab with our partner AstraZeneca and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the more than 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our Q1 execution given the pandemic-related disruption of new patient diagnoses and treatment. And we\u2019ll continue our focused execution during Q2, and are projecting recovery over the second half of the year.\nWith that, I\u2019ll turn it to Dave.\nDavid Reese\nThanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll begin with 2 new programs that are strong strategic fits within our portfolio. First, we are excited to welcome our new colleagues from Five Prime Therapeutics and begin work on bemarituzumab. The integration is going well and we have hit the ground running with Phase 3 planning activities.\nAs Bob mentioned, we received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA and look forward to discussions with regulators on the development program, including Phase 3 in the near future. We\u2019ll also investigate bemarituzumab and other indications where FGFR2b may play a role, including squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And we\u2019ll have more to say on the entire development program as those plans are finalized.\nIn inflammation, I would like to highlight our acquisition of Rodeo Therapeutics and their 15 prostaglandin dehydrogenase program, which was motivated by compelling preclinical data from Rodeo and valuable insights from deCODE. This is a nice illustration of our use of human genetic data to inform drug discovery and development.\nLUMAKRAS program continues to advance with several regulatory milestones in the first quarter, including global submissions for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and the priority review from FDA with a regulatory action date of August 16. We\u2019re having productive interactions with the FDA and multiple other regulatory agencies that will include Japan with today\u2019s anticipated submission, and we look forward to making LUMAKRAS available to patients as soon as possible.\nWe\u2019re also pleased to receive Temporary Authorization for Use status in France. This designation is to promote fast access to innovative medicines before marketing authorization and conventional access, and we have received a large number of requests.\nIn the clinical development program, we completed enrollment in the Phase 3 study versus docetaxel in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Based on the overall efficacy and safety profile of LUMAKRAS and discussions with regulators, we reduce the sample size in this study, while maintaining appropriate statistical power to assess the progression free survival primary endpoint. The timelines of the study have not changed as the primary endpoint remains event driven.\nAlthough, we have demonstrated that the 960 milligram dose is safe and efficacious in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, we continue to explore different doses and regimens as is common in oncology drug development. As part of this effort, we are initiating a new cohort to determine whether a once-daily oral dose of 240 milligrams maintains the safety and efficacy profile of the 960 milligram dose in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Should a lower dose be as safe and efficacious as 960 milligrams, it may further enhance the patient experience with one-daily LUMAKRAS.\nWe expect the results from this study in late 2022 or early 2023, and do not expect any impact on the timelines of our ongoing priority review. We also continue to make good progress in evaluating combination regimens. Efficacy cohorts are underway for our MEK inhibitor, EGFR antibody, and oral EGFR inhibitor combinations. And we expect to present updates on these regimens at medical meetings in the second half of the year.\nWe continue to evaluate doses and regimens to find the optimal options for patients in our other combinations, including PD-1 and SHP2.\nFinally, we are initiating triplet cohorts in colorectal cancer of LUMAKRAS, with standard of care chemotherapy and either an anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF antibody.\nIn our BiTE programs, we have initiated several new studies, including new indications for AMG 160, targeting PSMA in non-small cell lung cancer, and AMG 757, targeting DLL3, now also being investigated in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Details on these and other development programs, including small molecules can be found in our press release.\nTurning to tezepelumab developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca. The Phase 3 NAVIGATOR data were well received by clinicians and additional analyses will be presented at the American Thoracic Society meeting in May.\nWe remain on track to submit regulatory filings this quarter and believe the data support tezepelumab as a first line biologic therapy for a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We are also investigating other indications with Phase 2 studies in COPD and chronic spontaneous urticaria. And most recently, a Phase 3 study for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.\nFinally, on Otezla, we submitted a supplemental new drug application to FDA based on the Phase 3 ADVANCE study in mild to moderate psoriasis. The positive results from ADVANCE were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology or AAD meeting a few days ago.\nIn closing, I\u2019d like to thank our staff for continuing to deliver for patients.\nRobert Bradway\nOkay, Erica, thank you. Let\u2019s turn now to Q&A. And perhaps you could remind our callers of the procedure for asking questions. Thanks.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham\nHey, guys, thanks for the question. I had a question on Otezla, the head to head against deucravacitinib at AAD showed some pretty meaningful differentiation. I just wanted to ask from a maybe a commercial perspective, how does that dataset along with the ADVANCE data change you\u2019re thinking about, the positioning of Otezla in the marketplace with respect to psoriasis? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway\nMurdo?\nMurdo Gordon\nYeah, thanks, Geoff, for the question. The first thing I would just reiterate is that we anticipated that the deucra data would indeed show what they did show. And we assumed that in the model that we put together for the transaction and we\u2019ve assumed that for the balance of this year.\nWhat I would say is that we continue to believe that Otezla is really ideally positioned in the first line pre-biologic psoriasis market. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve been on the market for 6 years now. We have in-market cumulative patient experience with over 500,000 individuals globally.\nWe have excellent commercial and payer coverage at over 90% of covered lives. And we continue to make really good progress holding a 30% share in the market with really outstanding customer-facing capabilities. The other thing that we, of course, look at is positioning in the market and how that holds up against not just deucra, but other competitors.\nAnd we think that, we really are the first kind of option pre-biologic post-topical. And dermatologists have become very comfortable using Otezla that way. Payer coverage is consistent with that position in the market. And with the pending mild to moderate indication data, which were presented at the same AAD meeting, which were quite compelling.\nWe expect to be able to expand our utilization of Otezla in psoriasis population, in the milder patient type. So overall, we like our position in the market. The way I see it is we still have to see how the full detailed safety data look for the TYK2 product, given that it is part of the JAK family. And it took 6 years and over 200,000 patients for us to understand the Xeljanz safety profile. So I think there is a lot still to be understood here, but not necessarily the safety and efficacy of Otezla.\nGeoff Meacham\nOkay, great. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Michael Yee with Jefferies.\nMichael Yee\nI have a question maybe for David. You had a nice update and comments on KRAS. Maybe you could just put some context around the timing of data now for the second half, around MEK, maybe talk about what drives the timing of that and disclosure.\nAnd then the comment around 240 versus 960, I think there\u2019d be different ways to interpret that. Maybe you can make a comment about that, because I thought 960 was pretty well tolerated. It\u2019s got a good profile. So maybe make some comments on that. That will be great. Thanks, David.\nDavid Reese\nYeah, thanks, Mike, both great questions. I think our anticipation is that at meetings right into the start of the second half of the year, we\u2019ll start to see some of the cohort data that we outlined, MEK and then both EGFR antibody and small molecule inhibitor combinations. And you can probably see those come out sequentially over the second half of the year, as we accumulate data.\nI would say that the combination therapy programs are moving along quite rapidly. And as we mentioned, we\u2019ve opened some new triplet combination. So I feel very good about where we are in the status of combination regimens. In terms of the dose comparison study, we\u2019ve now got long-term data from both our Phase 1 trial, as well as the Phase 2 trial, updated target coverage information, pharmacokinetics, as well as of course, efficacy and safety data. And based on modeling, we wondered, could we achieve adequate target coverage at 250 and preserve potentially the same efficacy profile that we\u2019ve seen at 960 milligrams?\nAnd so, that\u2019s just the question that we\u2019re going to ask. It\u2019s quite common to continue dose exploration in oncology molecules. And I would view this as par for the course. We are very pleased with the tolerability profile. And as you pointed out, at 960 milligrams we\u2019ve had an outstanding experience. In fact, this is one of the best tolerated drugs that I\u2019ve been involved with in 30 years in oncology drug development. And that\u2019s not really what a driver is here, but can we potentially get by with efficacy at a lower 240 milligram dose and enhance patient experience?\nMichael Yee\nYeah. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer.\nJay Olson\nOh, hey, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m curious about the Phase 2 data for Olpasiran that you expect in the first half of next year. Can you just talk about what sort of signals you\u2019ll be looking for in that data, in terms of your plans to design a Phase 3 study and any potential points of differentiation from Pelacarsen? Thank you.\nDavid Reese\nYeah, thanks, Jay. And for those who may not know off the top of their heads, what Olpasiran is, this was formerly AMG 890. It\u2019s small interfering RNA, designed to lower lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, where elevated LP little a may be a driver.\nAs we noted, we completed enrollment in what\u2019s a robust Phase 2 trial that actually completed enrollment ahead of schedule. And what we\u2019ll be looking for, as we unveil those data, Jay, are first of all, longer-term follow-up, meaning sufficient long-term suppression of Lp(a) levels and our targets would be in the range of the Phase 1 data that we presented last November, at the American Heart Association meeting, and then of course, additional safety data.\nAnd of course, we are exploring different dose levels, as is pretty much standard in a program like this. And so, this would be in part for dose selection for Phase 3 going forward. We are very actively engaged already in Phase 3 planning and what the design of that sort of trial may look like.\nBased on the data that we\u2019ve seen to date, one of our goals may be relatively infrequent dosing, given the duration of effect that we observed in the Phase 1 trial. And that\u2019s one thing that we\u2019ll be taking a close look at, as well in Phase 2.\nJay Olson\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison\nGreat. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could just comment a little more detail on the Repatha trends. It looks like we\u2019re really starting to see the product break out a little bit here and not seeing some of those first quarter gross-to-net issues that you\u2019ve sort of experienced in the past couple years.\nDo you think you\u2019re at a point now where you\u2019re going to get to substantial Part D penetration and also see rest of world penetration? Maybe you could just comment on your outlook there. Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon\nYeah, thank you, Matthew. We are pleased, obviously, with the quarter for Repatha. And, it\u2019s been a bit of a journey getting here and trying to ensure that patients have affordable access to Repatha, particularly in Medicare Part D, as you point out.\nI would say that we are anticipating with one exception, we are anticipating relatively stable net price for the remainder of the year. And the exception that I\u2019m pointing out is that as we expand our penetration of Medicare Part D, we will have some drag on our net price as a function of patients entering and staying in the doughnut hole for a period of time.\nSo that\u2019s the one downside of helping patients in Medicare Part D. There is still a coverage gap in that benefit. And, of course, given the durability of treatment and the chronic nature of Repatha, they can be in that coverage gap for quite a bit. So we do have more exposure to the doughnut hole over time.\nBut as you could tell from the first quarter, we were more than able to offset that small drag on. net price. And we anticipate that we\u2019ll continue to penetrate that patient population, given the very strong payer coverage we have there with \u2013 between commercial and Medicare, we\u2019ve got over 80% covered lives for this important product.\nAnd there are still millions of patients out there who are sub-optimally treated for their hyperlipidemia given that they\u2019re at very high risk of cardiovascular events. So \u2013 and globally, we were seeing some really strong performance in Europe and the Americas. China is doing quite well, despite not having an RDL listing. And we continue to make inroads in Japan where we are the only PCSK9 on the market.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Yaron Werber with Cowen & Company.\nYaron Werber\nGreat. David, if you don\u2019t mind, I just have a follow-up question as well about LUMAKRAS relating to PD-1 combo specifically. I think you\u2019ve said in the past that you haven\u2019t gotten to the MTD on both drugs, as you tested them in combination, it sounds that you\u2019re continuing to explore dose and schedule.\nYou\u2019ve also recently talked about sequential therapy. So was just trying to say, are we actually going to get data in the second half and why are you testing sequential therapy? What are you trying to say? Thank you.\nDavid Reese\nYeah, thanks, Yaron. We\u2019re continuing to look at a variety of approaches in combination with PD-1s, whether that\u2019s in combination or sequentially. I think it\u2019s fair to say a number of small molecules, EGFR inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors had challenges combining with PD-1s. And I think there\u2019s a fair amount of work out here.\nWe are \u2013 we\u2019ll provide updates. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll have data that\u2019s robust enough to share in the second half of the year. That\u2019s possible. But I don\u2019t want to promise that, but certainly we\u2019ll provide guidance as those different regimens move along in sequential therapy, maybe actually a preferred approach here.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn\nHi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one follow-up on that, Dave, I was just wondering, does the 940 mg dose exploration have to do with this question on how to best combine KRAS with a PD-1? And then, my other question, I just was wondering Bob or Peter, if you could comment on the tax proposals coming out of DC and any implications for your Puerto Rico \u2013 some of the tax benefits you get out of Puerto Rico on the manufacturing side? Thank you.\nDavid Reese\nYeah. Thanks, Terence. I\u2019ll take the first part of that question. Yeah, the 240 milligram dose comparison study, doesn\u2019t have really anything to do with the combinations. Dosing as you\u2019re aware, in combination regimens in oncology, one, typically explores a range of doses, potentially of all of the members of that combination regimen, depending on what the backbone may be. But this is really a monotherapy exploration, and again, determined to see whether we can preserve efficacy at a lower dose at this lower 240 milligram dose.\nRobert Bradway\nOn the tax front, Peter, why don\u2019t you share our thoughts?\nPeter Griffith\nI will. Terence, very good question there. And, look, I think it\u2019s premature to speculate on this. We expect the administration\u2019s proposal for the subject, I think is everybody does to \u2013 significant debate within Congress and other stakeholders.\nRest assured, we\u2019re active in Washington to ensure that our position [and our tax system] [ph] should continue to be competitive, and should continue to really encourage innovation in the United States [as well heard and understood] [ph].\nAnd we are very supportive, as you can imagine of incentives to encourage manufacturing in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. And, Terence, I would just let you know that our tax leader Jackie Crouse has much expertise in the area of Puerto Rico, not just around tax, but just overall into how the economy down there functions and so forth. So she\u2019s called upon regularly by the legislators for advice and counsel. Thanks again for the question.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat\nHi, thanks so much for taking my question. David, I have a 2-part question on KRAS. First, perhaps if you could just walk us through your thought process on why 240 in particular? Why not 180 or 360? And I say that in the context of having seen responses as low as 180, perhaps, you could even give us a flavor for the PK curves look like around the 240 doses above and below?\nAnd secondly, I recall back when the Phase 3 was initiated for KRAS. The powering math was really directed at OS, not PFS, even though the primary endpoints PFS. I realize the conversations with FDA have moved towards PFS, and looks like the new powering is more than reasonable for PFS. But I do want understand the evolution and thought process away from OS, and what we can reasonably expect on p-values around OS with data that Amgen? Thank you.\nDavid Reese\nYeah. Thanks, Umer. Good question. Yeah, the 240 milligram dose was chosen based on modeling that we\u2019ve done that really takes account of all of the dose levels pharmacokinetic data, target coverage data, or accumulated preclinical data regarding efficacy at different target coverage levels. And, this was really chosen as a lower bound, where we thought we would potentially preserve or could preserve the efficacy that we\u2019re seeing at 960 milligrams.\nIn regards to the Phase 3 trial, as you note, we change the powering to really have \u2013 we have good power on the progression free survival endpoint that was done in concert with regulators. We will be able to take a look at overall survival. The power will be somewhat reduced in terms of the overall survival endpoint, but \u2013 I think, we\u2019ll still have a pretty good sense of what the drug is producing in terms of overall survival. Part of the thinking here is well is to minimize exposure of patients to the docetaxel control arm.\nUmer Raffat\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Mohit Bansal with Citi.\nMohit Bansal\nQuestion \u2013 and maybe 1 question for Murdo. So Onpro has done really well during pandemic. Could you please remind us how often these contracts are negotiated? And should we expect any reversal in Onpro trends? Are we seeing anything there as the pandemic subsides? Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon\nThanks, Mohit. The contracts aren\u2019t necessarily on the schedule. We have some large networks, where we negotiate annually, but we have a lot of smaller what we call value-based accounts, where we contract on a much more non-calendarized basis, so they\u2019re happening throughout the course of the year. And is your question with respect to reversal \u2013 are you asking me about price trends, volume trends? Can you clarify that question?\nMohit Bansal\nI mean, the trends, because there was a trend towards using more Onpro versus the PFS, given it is to taken at-home products. So do you think there could be some kind of reversal there as the pandemic subside, because then patients can come in and then get their shots?\nMurdo Gordon\nYeah, thank you for the clarification. Obviously, we\u2019re watching that clearly, the pandemic was stimulus for many oncologists to think more carefully about the G-CSF treatment that they were going to use in order to help minimize the amount of provider interaction that patients would incur. What we have been doing in the meantime, though, is reinforcing that you actually can improve outcomes by using long acting G-CSF. And using Onpro in particular, so we have a promotional effort that I think is helping strengthen the volume demand curve.\nThe only thing I will continue to point out, though, is with competition comes some price erosion. And we have a new competitor entrant in that category in the long acting G-CSF category. So we anticipate more net price negative evolution through the remainder of the year.\nMohit Bansal\nGot it. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges\nRight. Thank you very much for the question. Murdo, could you just discuss the issue of price pretty significant negative price effect? First of all, could you tell us whether that\u2019s all in the U.S. or whether it\u2019s U.S. and ex-U.S.? And then secondly, essentially, in the U.S. took significant price increases at the end of the year, but still have negative price Q-on-Q looks like 8% or 9%? Is this going to be a trend that persists throughout the year? And then, Bob, perhaps you could comment on what we should be modeling in terms of legislative or executive order changes to pricing going forward? You usually have your finger on the pulse in Washington. Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon\nSure. All right. Thanks, Geoff. Let me go first on the overall price evolution in the portfolio, we continue to believe that mid-single-digit net negative price for the portfolio for the years, the right number, that\u2019s what we continue to see what you know and what we experienced, probably more than some of our peer companies in the first quarter, given the nature of our portfolio is more net negative price evolution, because of patients renewing and their benefits, and going through benefit re-verification and hitting, they\u2019re kind of out of pocket recess.\nAnd so our co-pay assistance programs have more drag, we did activate more payer access at the end of last year into this. So we did have on some brands, some increased payer coverage at the cost of some net price negative evolution. But we do anticipate Q1 being the lowest compare, Q2 a little better, and then Q3 and Q4 being better thereafter.\nGeoffrey Porges\nGreat. Thank you.\nRobert Bradway\nAnd, Jeff, on Washington, I\u2019m not sure whether executive orders the concern these days, or whether it\u2019s something that\u2019s attached to reconciliation, if I had to guess I\u2019d say that the greater risk of something being attached to reconciliation. But it\u2019s still not very clear how this administration and members of the Democratic Party in general, want to try to tackle the question of drug pricing this year. So we\u2019re continuing to stay very involved, as you\u2019d expect, and we have the benefit, I think of being able to demonstrate just how important innovation is with the progress you see being made against the pandemic.\nAnd so, we\u2019ll continue to stay active and focus on the things that could be done to improve patient access to medicines. And, I think the other thing, Jeff is to continue to shine a light on the role of the middlemen and how much of the pharmaceutical dollars now wind up in the hands of the middlemen, which I think now, across the country is just an excess of 50%. I think it actually is at 51% now. So we\u2019ll continue to draw attention to that as well.\nGeoffrey Porges\nRight. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nAlethia Young\nHey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted you guys talk a little bit more about the moderate-to-severe psoriasis market and how you plan on kind of penetrating with the current commercial salesforce you have, especially, in light of potential competition that may emerge over time in Bristol? And then just also with the SHIP2 program, is that still underway as a combination for you guys? Thanks.\nRobert Bradway\nMaybe I\u2019ll just start very quickly, Alethia. SHIP2, yeah, that\u2019s underway, and we\u2019re continuing to work on that combination more to come. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon\nYeah, Alethia, as I mentioned earlier in response to the question on the TYK2 data that were recently presented. As I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we have begun primary care promotion for Otezla in the currently labeled mild-to-moderate patient population, and have seen good response there in terms of uptake with 11% TRx year-on-year performance for the quarter. We\u2019re pretty pleased with that evolution, what we are seeing is a slowdown in the psoriasis patient population in the newly diagnosed patient population, in particular. We think this is a direct impact of COVID causing patients with psoriasis, not to see their dermatologist starting really at the beginning of the pandemic, but what\u2019s happened is the cumulative effect of this is starting that to impact the patients that have passed through some of the topical options.\nAnd we depend on bio-naive patients for our growth. So we are definitely pre-biologic option for dermatologists. So we are watching that closely, and we think that that could continue to create some softness in the pre-biologic psoriasis patient market opportunity into Q2 with recovery thereafter, because we are seeing much more patient volume in dermatology offices in March and into April. So we think that things are recovering. But it will take a while for that cumulative effect of new patient softness to work its way through the market.\nIn terms of overall positioning in the market, we continue to think that our safety and efficacy profile is a very attractive option for patients and dermatologists as that first systemic agent pre-biologic, and I think really these days in rheumatology and dermatology, physicians are much more aware of the different categories of options that they have, and the different profiles of the different classes of drugs. And I think that with recent data in the JAK category, there\u2019ll be some speculation and some hesitancy to use a product like the TYK2, as a first bio-naive option for to treat patients.\nRobert Bradway\nHey, Erica, thanks, let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Dane Leone with Raymond James.\nDane Leone\nHi, thank you for taking the questions, and congrats on the update in the start to the year. So the question for me, just as a follow-up to some of those sotorasib questions. Is really maybe since people have been asking about fairly specific things, I think, what everyone\u2019s trying to analyze and some of the updates, if we\u2019re really only getting longer-term follow-up on your pivotal dataset at ASCO is, what\u2019s the team\u2019s view right now of the ability to move sotorasib into the frontline setting and long, a lot of us had thought that you would need a successful combination with PD-1 to move in the frontline setting. Obviously, we haven\u2019t seen you guys start a pivotal dataset. And you just said, might take longer to figure out that algorithm.\nAlternatively, you go down the SHIP2 pathway, do you, 1 have a timeline for showing us SHIP2 combination data? And 2, is there an alternative path for getting sotorasib into the frontline long setting that we should be thinking about that we might be missing on this call right now? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway\nYeah, thanks, Dane. In terms of potential frontline combinations, I think a number of them that are being examined in the master protocol, if we can enhance efficacy by multiple hits on the pathway could be feasible, for example, the MEK combination. The EGFR inhibitor combinations, and then as well, as you mentioned PD-1 whether that is in combination or sequentially, for example, to rely on a priming effect is a question that we\u2019re trying to answer.\nSHIP2, I would also consider an additional hit on the pathway and would also fall into that grouping. So I think, we\u2019ll be guided by emerging data, but all of those would be potential avenues into earlier lines of therapy, in addition also potentially avenues into other indications such as colorectal cancer in some of the other solid tumors, where G12C mutations occur.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.\nRonny Gal\nGood afternoon. And thank you for getting me in. 2 if I may. First, just the traditional sotorasib question. I guess, we saw some data in ACR about patient having multiple escape mutations from the first \u2013 from being when treated with KRASG12C inhibitor. And I was wondering, does that concern you that that patient escapes so quickly with multiple mechanisms that suggests that maybe 2 agents will not be enough? Or is that kind of thoughts for the course, and this is what was expected.\nAnd second, we have seen some of your peers\u2019 license China developed and tested product to bring to the developed market, especially in oncology. And I was wondering if you consider this strategy, especially as the by similar player, this seems to be a natural complimentary strategy, any so where do you come from that?\nRobert Bradway\nMaybe I\u2019ll start with the first part, and then have Murdo address the second part. Yeah, in terms of the mutational patterns that were recently reported, I would say that biologically, nothing that we thought surprised us based on everything we\u2019ve learned about these pathways in the last 30 to 40 years and the potential mechanisms of resistance. This also points the way, I think, 2 specific combinations that may, in fact, help to ameliorate those resistance patterns. I will point out that we will be presenting in short order here also updated comprehensive biomarker data including mutational data, and I think you\u2019ll find that of interest in that is certainly helping to guide our own thinking about the development program as well. Murdo, do you want to take the second half of the question?\nMurdo Gordon\nYes, Ronny, we continue to look globally for product opportunities to license and promote in the world. And I think in oncology, in particular, there have been some interesting deals done lately. We obviously have a strong partnership already with a company based in China through Beijing. And we continue to enjoy that partnership and the co-development that we have. I would also say that given our global footprint, Amgen really is an excellent partner choice with our global capabilities in oncology and general medicine. So we\u2019re opening to business with Chinese companies, Japanese companies, global companies, absolutely.\nRobert Bradway\nOkay. We\u2019re pushing up against the top of the hour. So we\u2019re trying to get over questions. But are we bringing on the next caller?\nOperator\nOkay. Our next question is from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould\nGood afternoon, thanks for all the color today, maybe just switching gears a bit and moving to the DCMA sounds like you\u2019re about to go back into the clinic, can you maybe just give us some color on sort of the changes to the protocol or dose escalation and any read through to the broader platform, and just, I guess, focus more specifically on DCMA with those changes comment on sort of your competitiveness in a increasingly competitive space? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway\nYeah, Carter, thanks for the question. So we do expect to begin dosing again, hopefully, in the next few weeks or so. As you intuited, this would adjust some of the inter-patient dose escalation that is typical with the use of BiTE molecules, and so that we\u2019ll be pushing that forward. More broadly, obviously, we want to be able to deliver a program here that can offer something to patients, and physicians that they realize might not have, and we\u2019ll continually assess the program against that metric.\nMore broadly, I\u2019m quite pleased with the progress we made on AMG 160 and AMG 757. And, as always \u2013 we\u2019ll always provide a cautionary note about extrapolating extensively across programs, because much of what we witness in the clinic is target dependent and so all of these programs will have their idiosyncrasies that need to be worked through as part of the development program.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Colin Bristow with UBS Equities.\nColin Bristow\nGood evening. Thanks for take me in. Just a quick update from you guys on the business development priorities. What are your current areas of interest? How are you thinking about deal size? And just some overall, I guess, commentary on how you\u2019re thinking about valuations in the space? Thanks.\nRobert Bradway\nWell, Colin, as you know, we transacted 2 acquisitions in the first quarter, 1 of the preclinical stage, 1 of the Phase 3 ready, and I think that reflects the breadth of interest that we have. We\u2019re continuing to look at acquisitions and licensing opportunities in our stated areas of focus. So, in particular, immunology the inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer are attracted to us. And then we have very strong franchises in the few other therapeutic areas, as you know, and in migraine and bone health and nephrology. So we look for commercial opportunities there as well.\nColin Bristow\nThat\u2019s helpful. Maybe just 1 quick question in terms of protein degradation, obviously, you have a platform that somewhat early, you have any interest in expanding you\u2019re positioning in that space?\nRobert Bradway\nYeah, as we said before, I think going forward we would expect the development of what we call the induced proximity platform to depend both on internal innovation and external partnerships and potentially acquisition. So we\u2019re open to both. We\u2019re making a lot of progress there. And we\u2019ll provide more detail a bit later.\nColin Bristow\nGood. Thank you.\nRobert Bradway\nErica, I gather we have a couple more questions lined up. So we\u2019ll take those remaining questions with apologies to the audience that we\u2019re going over the allotted hour. But let\u2019s get to next question.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.\nRobyn Karnauskas\nThanks, guys. So you addressed a little bit of the moderate to severe pressure on the competition for Otezla. Could you again address a little bit more, now that we have more granular data from Tapinarof and others on the topicals?\nDo you think the topicals being cheaper might push out some of the uptake in the biologics for Otezla? And then, if you want to answer that one, just throwing out here, you\u2019re one of the first to do RTOR application for oncology with all the FDA controversy development. Can you just tell us like, how that\u2019s going? Is it proceeding as normal?\nWe\u2019re all wondering how that application process will go, because that could be the faster way to market for a lot of new drugs. Thanks.\nRobert Bradway\nLet\u2019s try to get them both quickly.\nMurdo Gordon\nAll right, Robyn. Look, we think that there\u2019s obviously a role for topicals to play for patients with low body surface area involvement in their disease. When it starts to become a broader surface area or in awkward places on the patient\u2019s body, then they\u2019re looking for a systemic agent, and they\u2019re looking for a safe and effective one. And that\u2019s really where we think the mild to moderate opportunity is for Otezla. And we\u2019re not even considering the millions of patients out there with mild to moderate.\nWe\u2019re looking at about 40% to 50% addressable patient population. So we\u2019re giving at least half the market as a topical market, assuming the other half would be addressable with an oral. Dave?\nDavid Reese\nYeah. And, in terms of RTOR or Real-Time Oncology Review, what that does is permit submission of tranches of data, as you move through the submission process, as opposed to waiting and submitting either a complete file all at once or very large chunks of a file. We\u2019ve had very productive interactions with the FDA. And in our view, the RTOR process has worked quite nicely here.\nIn the longer term, quite frankly, I think this is the way of the future not only in oncology, but across therapeutic areas for more real-time submission of data, probably from the inception of development programs.\nRobert Bradway\nErica, let\u2019s take 2 last questions, please.\nOperator\nYour next question is from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets.\nKennen MacKay\nHey, thanks for squeezing me in. A question on tezepelumab. We recently heard from a KOL some thoughts that this actually could be as competitive as some of the other biologics in asthma in the high eosinophil group, not just competitive in the high unmet need [levy eosinophil] [ph] market. Just wondering when that data does come out, that full publication does come out, really what we should be looking for in these high eosinophil patients for signs of competitiveness there. Thank you.\nRobert Bradway\nYeah. Thanks, Kevin. As we\u2019ve reported, as you saw, and we\u2019ll be providing some data updates, additional analyses on the NAVIGATOR Phase 3 trial at the American Thoracic Society meeting in a few weeks now. Across the board, we saw efficacy that we think is consistent with first line use.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that there are many patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, who have disease that is seeking another treatment right now, meaning they are not controlled with currently available therapies. And so, regardless of eosinophil count, we think that the clinical profile of this molecule is quite attractive. And my view continues to be that this is just going to be a really important medicine in asthma for patients.\nArvind Sood\nErica, let\u2019s take one last question.\nOperator\nYour final question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.\nCory Kasimov\nUpdated LUMAKRAS\u2019 ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and do you see this as a potential future source of differentiation one way or the other in the KRAS field? Thank you.\nDavid Reese\nYeah, Cory, thanks. Quickly, so we are actually studying specifically LUMAKRAS in patients with brain metastases. I think the clinical data will be definitive here. And once we\u2019ve amassed a large enough dataset, we\u2019ll present that. But it\u2019s full speed ahead to answer that question.\nRobert Bradway\nOkay. Well, thank you all for your patience and for dialing in to the call today. I remind you as always that Arvind and his team will be around for several hours still, if you had other questions that you didn\u2019t get answered. But we appreciate your support and look forward to being back with you in July. Thanks.\nArvind Sood\nThank you, everybody.\nOperator\nThis concludes Amgen\u2019s First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.\n\n",

All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nJerry Leshne\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern.\nDuring this call, we will refer to forward-looking statements about our Company. These are subject to the uncertainties and the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.\nAt this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.\nMichael Roth\nThank you, Jerry, and thank you for joining us this morning as we review our results for the quarter. I\u2019ll start by covering highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional details, and I\u2019ll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by the Q&A.\nWe\u2019re pleased to report solid first quarter revenue growth which comes on top of outstanding performance a year ago. Organic revenue growth was 2.7% in Q1, against 6.7% a year ago, our steepest quarterly comp. In the US, organic growth was 2.9%, up against industry leading 8.3% growth in 2016. Faced by another strong result in Continental Europe, international markets grew 2.2% in pass-through.\nAs has been the case in recent years, our growth was broad-based by discipline as well. In Q1, we were led by media, our digital specialist, public relations, advertising and sports market. This continues to underscore the strength of our offerings across the portfolio and is an encouraging start to the New Year.\nFX was negative to our reported revenue by 1% in the quarter due to the continuing strength of US dollar and had a similar impact on our operating expenses. Net business dispositions of several small non-strategic units drag on revenue by 1% as well, as we had said would be the case on our February conference call.\nOperating profit in Q1 was $30 million, compared with $23 million last year, which reflects both our growth and the effectiveness of our ongoing discipline around expenses. As you know, our first quarter is seasonally small in terms of revenues while total costs are distributed fairly throughout the year. That said Q1, operating profit growth of 29% and operating margin growth of 40 basis points, which leverage both of our principal expense lines are indicative of solid progress towards our full year financial target.\nReturning to the top-line, our growth continues to reflect contribution from a range of our major agencies, led in Q1 by Mediabrands, McCann, R/GA, Hill Holliday, Octagon and Golin. Our digital offerings continued their solid growth. This includes a broad range of embedded digital capabilities within our agency networks, as well as a standalone digital specialist. In terms of client sectors, we were led by increases in the healthcare and retail sectors, as well as by strong growth with diversified industrial and government clients. The quarter also reflects growth with existing clients as well as net new business wins over the trailing 12 months.\nOur capital structure continues to be a source of value creation. As we announced in the February, this is the fifth consecutive year that our Board has increased our quarterly dividend by at least 20%. On a full year 2016 call, we announced that our Board had authorized another $300 million of share repurchases. During Q1, we repurchased 2.3 million shares using $55 million, which is consistent with Q1 of 2016. As you know, our share repurchase activity tends to track to the seasonality of our cash flows over the course of the year. Over the trailing 12 months, we utilized $305 million for the repurchase of 13 million. \nSince initiating our dividend and repurchases in 2011, we\u2019ve returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders, which has driven a 28% reduction to our diluted share count with an average repurchase cost of $14.32. We\u2019ve also tripled our per share dividend over this period of time.\nJust last week S&P announced that it upgraded our debt credit ratings to BBB. This brings us to solid investment grade standing across all major credit rating agencies, which represents another important marker of progress at IPG. By fulfilling a longstanding objective of this management team, we\u2019ve achieved a milestone that will yield benefits in terms of enhanced financial flexibility.\nWe\u2019re pleased that our performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people. Outstanding consumer insights, industry-leading creativity and the delivery of efficient and precisely targeted communications have all become hallmarks of IPG and our agencies.\nThe top-tier digital capabilities we have the across the portfolio also continues to be a differentiated for us. By keeping the clients front and center, we can combine all of the skill sets into integrated solutions that are customized to the needs of our clients. This in turn positions us strongly in the evolving world of media and marketing.\nWe are, as always, highly focused on capitalizing on growth to drive further margin expansion and capital return. The strength of our offerings coupled with the strong record of operating discipline is a winning combination that will ensure that we will continue to deliver for client and shareholders alike. As you know, Q1 is seasonally small for us. There is still continued uncertainty driven by macroeconomics and geopolitical factors including potential tax reforms, healthcare and infrastructure. However, we are confident that performance to date has us fully on track to deliver on the 3% to 4% organic growth target we set for the full year as well as to expand operating margin by an additional 50 basis points relative to 2016.\nAt this stage, I\u2019d like to turn things over to Frank for additional detail on our results. And after this remarks, I\u2019ll be back to provide the update of our agencies, tone of business to be followed by a Q&A.\nFrank Mergenthaler\nThank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone.\nAs a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to the slide presentation that accompanies our webcast. On slide two, you see an overview of our results. Organic revenue growth was 2.7% in the first quarter, 2.9% in the US and 2.2% in our international markets. Excluding a small increase in pass-through revenue and related expense, organic revenue growth was 2.5%. Q1 operating profit was $30 million, an increase of $7 million compared to last year in our seasonally small first quarter. Diluted EPS is $0.05, which compares to $0.01 as reported last year and compares favorably to $0.02 per share as adjusted for items a year ago.\nTurning to slide three, you see our P&L for the quarter. I\u2019ll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. It is worth noting here that Q1 2016 includes the reclassification of $2 million of pension expense from salaries and other income, reflecting the adoption of the new pension accounting standard. The impact was approximately $800,000 in Q1 2017. Further down the P&L, it\u2019s also worth noting that we had a tax benefit in the quarter against our seasonally small Q1 pretax earnings. That is a result of our mix of profit and loss by tax jurisdiction around the world and the excess tax benefit of share based compensation in our first quarter. We continue to expect that our effective tax rate will be in the range of 35 to 36% for the full year.\nTurning to revenue on slide four. Revenue was $1.75 billion in the quarter. Compared to Q1 2016, the impact of the change in exchange rates was negative 1% while net dispositions were negative1% as well. Resulting revenue increase was 70 basis points as reported and organic increase of 2.7%. As you can see on the bottom half of this slide, organic growth was 2.2% at our integrated agency network segment, which is good performance against 7.6% growth in Q1 2016 with contributions from all the IAN disciplines and across a range of agencies. CNG grew 4.6% organically led by Octagon, Golin and Weber Shandwick.\nMoving on to slide five, revenue by region. US organic growth was 2.9% and was 2% excluding increased pass-through revenues in the US. Again, growth was broad based across disciplines in agencies led by R/GA, Mediabrands, Jack Morton, Hill Holliday and McCann. Leading clients sectors were healthcare, food and beverage, auto and retail. We also had strong growth in our other category paced by energy, and industrial clients.\nTurning to international markets, the UK grew slightly on an organic basis but UK organic growth was 4.4% excluding the decrease in pass-through revenue. We had notably strong growth in McCann UK once again, along the growth at Weber Shandwick and Mediabrands. It\u2019s also worth noting that acquisitions contributed another 3% to growth in the UK but the dollar pound relationship decreased our reported UK revenue by about 14%. Continental Europe increased 6.7% organically. Among our largest markets, we were led by strong results in Germany and Italy while France and Spain were flat compared to last year.\nIn Asia Pac, we had an organic decrease of 2.7%, reflecting lower spending from a number of our clients in China where we were lapping exceptional growth in last year\u2019s first quarter, as well as a decrease from Australia. We continue to see very good growth in India and Japan.\nLatAm grew 3.7% organically on top of 11.6% a year ago. We continue to have strong performances by our agencies in Mexico, Argentina and Chile, which offset lower revenue in Brazil. Our other markets group increased 7.8% organically in Q1, which is also notably strong performance on top of the 7.4% a year ago. This reflects growth in South Africa, the Middle East and Canada.\nOn slide six, we chart the longer view of our organic revenue change on a trailing 12-month basis; most recent data point is 4%.\nMoving on to slide seven. Total operating expenses in the first quarter increased 30 basis points from a year ago, compared to reported revenue growth of 70 basis points. As a result, our operating margin expanded 40 basis points. The ratio of salaries and related expenses to revenue in Q1 was 72.7% this year compared with 72.8% a year ago. Comparison reflects improved leverage on our other salaries and related expense, mainly due to lower expense or earn-outs offset by base payroll and incentive comp.\nThe total headcount at quarter end of approximately 50,200, which has increased about 1% from year-end 2016. We continue to invest on growth areas in the portfolio such as digital, media, advertising and PR, and to support our new business wins. On the lower half of the slide, our total O&G expense in the first quarter was essentially flat against last year, generating 20 basis points of operating leverage.\nOn slide eight, we show our operating margin history on a trailing 12-month basis with the most recent data point of 12.1%.\nOn slide nine, we turn to cash flow. Cash used in operations in Q1 was $372 million, compared with $654 million a year ago. As you know, our operating cash flow is highly seasonal. Our business typically generates significant cash and working capital in the fourth quarter and uses cash in the first quarter. During this year\u2019s first quarter, cash used in working capital was $439 million, compared with the use of $695 million in Q1 a year ago. The improvement was due to the timing of our working capital cash flows, which we had also referred to at the time of our fourth quarter call. While we have lower seasonal cash generation in Q4, this is the offset in Q1, lower use of cash in the first quarter.\nInvesting activities used $33 million in the quarter including $25 million of CapEx. Financing activities generated $64 million, due to an increase in short-term borrowings of $225 million. We used $71 million for our common stock dividend and $55 million for share repurchases. Our net decrease in cash and marketable securities for the quarter was $320 million compared with $831 million a year ago.\nTurning to the current portion of our balance sheet on slide 10. We ended the first quarter with $778 million in cash and short-term marketable securities compared with $680 million a year ago. It\u2019s worth noting that our cash level seasonal tends to peak at year-end and decrease during the first quarter.\nOn slide 11, we show debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.92 billion at the most recent quarter-end.\nIn summary on the slide 12, we are pleased with solid revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter, which represents a good start in terms of achieving our financial objectives for the full year.\nWith that, let me turn it back over to Michael.\nMichael Roth\nThank you, Frank. As we\u2019ve noted, against very challenging comps, we showed solid growth in the quarter. Digital activity across all of our agencies continues to be a significant driver of the success. And we saw positive contributions to our performance from a range of our offerings including advertising, media and marketing services. Disciplined cost management led to good progress during the quarter in terms of increased operating margin and our balance sheet remains an important factor that will allow us to further enhance shareholder value.\nOn the talent front, we\u2019re pleased that we remain a differentiated culture that attracts much of the industry\u2019s best talent, not only from our traditional peer sets but also in emerging areas such as digital content creation, social media as well as data and tech-enabled marketing.\nWe\u2019re also proud of our longstanding record in promoting diversity and inclusion. While we made meaningful strides and leading industry on many fronts, an area on which we are increasingly focusing is our ability to recruit, develop and promote people of color. That\u2019s because in order to keep our place as a leader in D&I and also continue to deliver best-in-class revenue growth, we must incorporate the broadest set of perspectives and skills into the thinking we deliver to clients. This will allow us to best reflect and connect to the markets with which we communicate with in order to be successful.\nAs we know, our industry is changing at a rapid pace. There is a great deal being written about the convergence that is bringing adjacent industries into others. [Ph] The increased competition that we all read about these days is not as evident to us as the headlines would have you believe. And it\u2019s possible we\u2019re seeing new forms of collaboration as well as competition as a result of the emerging market dynamics. But regardless of how the situation plays out, it bears noting that at IPG, we\u2019ve been preparing for this potential scenario for some time.\nOur creative firepower is amongst the best in our peer set and it represents a significant barrier relative to new entrants into the advertising space. Digitally, we\u2019re equally strong, having invested in these capabilities for nearly a decade. As importantly, our ability to integrate a broad spectrum of marketing activity for our clients is a powerful differentiator. Finally, our commitment to accountability driven by a strong and holistic data platform, allows us to answer key questions regarding the efficacy and value of the advice and the work we provide to marketers.\nTurning now to the tone of the business. Despite macro events that we are well aware of and which have caused a great degree of economic uncertainty, what we are hearing from clients and from our operators, point to a solid marketing environment and one which remains consistent with our achieving organic growth targets we set earlier this year. The new business pipeline is particularly strong in digital services. For us, this comes across all of our agencies. And we\u2019re seeing opportunities for our digital specialist, integrated ad agencies, as well as our PR, health communications and shopper marketing firms. There is also quite a bit of activity in the media sector, where we\u2019re involved in most of the major pitches. The pipeline for larger, traditional AOR assignments remains lighter. This represents the continuation of a trend we also saw last year.\nHighlights at the agency level include another quarter of very strong performance of R/GA, which continues to expand the breadth of its offerings, its relationships with major marketers and its geographic presence. We recently reviewed the progress of the agencies accelerated progress, which allow us to incubate and get line of sight into some amazing start-ups and cutting edge areas such as VR, artificial intelligence and marketing technologies. R/GA recently announced a new accelerated program in collaboration with Verizon Ventures, and our Ventures Studio program with Snap will be the first to incorporate clients and mentors for the full range of IPG agencies. Mediabrands also posted a very strong quarter growing with major multinational and domestic clients and on-boarding its new Hulu with Fitbit clients and announcing recently a win of Accenture.\nOur transparent and agnostic approach to media ensures that clients are getting not just top level buying power and expertise, but also the best unbiased advice when it comes to optimizing their marketing investments. This is increasingly important in a world that is seeing greater concentration of power among media owners, as well as other challenges that have come to light in areas like digital measurement and brand safety.\nCMG continues to deliver strong results and outstanding work across the full range of marketing services. From event and sports marketing to public relations, the work agencies like Octagon, Jack Morton, Golin and Weber Shandwick perform is becoming more strategic than ever.\nGiven the fragmented media landscape, there is a growing need for activities that engage consumer attention, connect to their passion points and feature a strong digital and social component. These are areas in which CMG shines. And we\u2019re looking forward to more strong performance from that group.\nMcCann Worldgroup posted strong results. We have consistently called out the great progress that McCann has made in terms of creative product and reputation, which now range at the top among the global advertising networks. The collaboration among McCann, MRM, Momentum and McCann Healthcare has also been tracking very well. And we\u2019re seeing significant integrated cross selling wins from existing Worldgroup clients, which is a kind of organic growth that can be most readily converted into increased profitability.\nMcCann has been an important driver of our improved performance in Continental Europe. And the network\u2019s progress in Middle East and Africa are also notable, as they position us for longer term growth in these promising regions. MullenLowe remains very active in new business, posting significant wins such as E-Trade, Hyatt Hotels and Chipotle. The agencies hyper bundle model is now up and running in key international markets including London, Shanghai and India where MullenLowe is a top-five agency. Hyper bundling ensures that MullenLowe\u2019s creative excellence is informed and enhanced by integrated digital, media and activation talent, which makes the agency strategies and campaigns more effective in the marketplace.\nAt FCB, we\u2019re seeing further progress in the Chicago headquarters office, which integrates strong consumer advertising, digital and shopper markets capabilities. FCB in Toronto and London is also a center of excellence, as well the agencies operations in India. FCB Health continues to be a strong driver of growth and a leader in its space. We\u2019re also pleased to see FCB/SIX, one of the agencies operations in Canada, recently recognized as a digital stand out in Adweek\u2019s Agencies 3.0 list, which called out the shop\u2019s ability to use data, CRM and video storytelling to seamlessly create real time messages, personalized for any audience.\nOur integrated US independents made news during the quarter on a new business front with wins like Phillips 66 at Carmichael Lynch and Party City at Hill Holliday. Both of those agencies also announced senior internal management promotions at the president or CEO level, which will ensure top management continuity. Deutsch won 7-Eleven title, [ph] the maker of Bluetooth-enabled location devices. We\u2019re looking for new ways to combine the strong offerings of these agencies with the terrific digital capabilities that Huge, our outstanding digital specialist agency which during the quarter won important new assignments from Verizon and United Technology. This should allow us to deliver even more powerful solutions to domestic clients.\nDuring the quarter, we also made a significant announcement regarding increased investment to further enhance our data and analytics capabilities. Reporting directly into IPG, Mediabrands\u2019 new Chief Data and Marketing Technology Officer will be charged with driving a more centralized data and technology infrastructure that can support all of our agencies, across the holding company.\nBy combining online and offline data sets and consolidating partnerships with third parties, we can build tools that allow us to better target high-value audiences, refine our strategies and messaging across every communication discipline, and prove the value of all our ideas and marketing programs, which will keep us highly relevant in today\u2019s media environment.\nAs I mentioned previously, another way in which we can ensure that we stay at top of mind with clients, is our ability to deliver integrated solutions. We were early to identifying this as a strategic priority and have been refining our open architecture model for close to a decade. Unlike our competitors, we don\u2019t disrupt the power of agency brands; instead, we get the best talent from across the group working together in flexible teams that are custom-built for each client situation or challenge. We\u2019re seeing the benefits of this approach on a number of our most important existing global clients, particularly in the pharma and tech industries.\nLooking forward, it\u2019s possible to make too much of Q1, given that it\u2019s a smallest quarter and that means percentages can fluctuate even when the absolute numbers are not large. But, we see the results that we are sharing today as indicative of a solid step into 2017. Our offerings are strong and we show vigilance on cost and appropriate margin conversion. As a result, we believe that we remain well-positioned to achieve our full year targets of organic revenue in the 3 to 4% range and to improve operating margin by an additional 50 basis points relative to 2016 levels. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our commitment to capital return, that means there is significant potential for value-creation and enhance shareholder value.\nAs always, we thank you for your time and support, and we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress during the course of the year. With that, I\u2019ll open up the floor to questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMC. Your line is now open.\nAlexia Quadrani\nThank you. Just a couple of questions; I guess, the first one is on the ongoing robust growth you continue to see in Continental Europe. I just want to drill down a further. You gave some great color by countries. But does it influence by your success in new business wins or are you seeing that sort of just an industry-wide growth? And then, are you able to utilize your NOLs now that you\u2019re seeing very healthy growth in that region now for three quarters, I believe? And then, just a follow-up question, just on your verticals; you highlighted retail being particularly strong. I guess, if you can sort of reconcile that with the weakness we\u2019re seeing in the retail industry. I guess, why is it particularly strong for you when the sector is struggling and any above average sort of pricing pressure on the consumer package with clients? Thanks.\nMichael Roth\nAll of that?\nAlexia Quadrani\nSorry.\nMichael Roth\nThat\u2019s okay; that\u2019s fine. By the way, let me just reference that that was not my phone that went off [multiple speakers]. All right. First on Continental Europe. Again, as you know, in Continental Europe, it\u2019s roughly 8% of our revenue and UK is 9%. It\u2019s significant, but not that significant. So, therefore, particular client wins has an impact on those positive results. So, I would say that in answer to the question, we had -- McCann in particular and Mediabrands had some nice wins in those markets, and we\u2019re seeing the effect of those wins. We\u2019re not raising a big flag as a big recovery in Continental Europe, which I think is the just of your question. And as far as the UK goes, that is solid gains across the board including our PR businesses and so on. So, we do draw a distinction between strength in the UK and the positive results we\u2019re seeing in Continental Europe, both obviously contributed to our overall performance.\nOn your question on the verticals, our biggest vertical continues, both on a worldwide and the U.S. basis is healthcare, it continues to be a very strong discipline for us and we\u2019re seeing very strong growth both out of FCB and McCann Health. So, that\u2019s very encouraging and we see that as a continuing factor in our growth going forward.\nAs far as retail goes, it\u2019s unique to our client servicing. These are not the retail clients for example. If you see, for example, the retail department stores in the U.S., which you\u2019re reading so much about. Here we\u2019re seeing particularly healthy, [ph] McCann won some business at Staples and of course Amazon we characterize as retail. So, those are the key factors in our growth. We don\u2019t have significant exposure to the retail organizations that you\u2019re reading about every day in the newspapers.\nAnd by the way, obviously our NOLs that you correctly point out are in Europe. And as we see profitability in Europe, we will continue to use those NOLs to offset on a cash tax basis, which is one of the reasons why you\u2019ll see our effective tax rate -- cash tax rate being less than our effective already. So that\u2019s positive for us and that continues to, as you know, go on for many years in terms of the availability.\nCPG, that one obviously we are seeing some pressure from clients like everyone else in terms of pricing and cutbacks. I see the opportunity on CPG because a lot of these multi-national clients in particular use hundreds of different agencies and they embarked on significant cost containment. And we are positioned and I think our clients\u2019 position is that consolidation of all these different agencies with a number of key providers will provide a lot of the efficiencies that they are looking for. So we see that -- one obviously there is pressure on fees and it\u2019s important for us to watch our cost profile as associated with that in efficiencies but also as an opportunity for us to pick up some new brands. And hopefully that will mitigate somewhat the pricing pressures that we\u2019re seeing at CPG. That said, food and beverage was slightly positive on a worldwide basis for us whereas the consumer goods was in fact negative.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of John Janedis from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nJohn Janedis\nThank you. Frank, it sounds like an old landline phone. Two questions. One is, Michael you spoke to the tone of business, your target assumes an organic acceleration this year. And I was wondering to what extent you\u2019re assuming wins to hit that target or do you -- your client conversations give you that comfort? And then, maybe separately bigger picture, as you know, there has been some concern in the market around competition from consultants, the CPG vertical you spoke to and then disintermediation of the agencies. So, with the US organic that you put out today and then I guess your peers in the first quarter and appreciating the comp, can you talk about why that these things may or may not be premature?\nMichael Roth\nYes. First of all, 63% of our business is in US, so that helps us. We see -- not a high growth rate in the US but moderate rate, low single digits, which as we said in the past, 3 or 4% organic growth, we should be able to continue to expand our margins. So, in the US, we\u2019re very strong across our media offerings, our independent agencies come in here, as well as our digital and creative capabilities and PR businesses in US. So that gives us a degree of comfort in our forecast at 3 to 4%.\nAnd our wins and losses were net new business positive. We did see in the first quarter, we did have to cycle through two losses, particularly in the US being Sprint on the creative side and USAA. So, we\u2019re seeing somewhat of an impact of that in the first quarter but we do have net new business coming on board. So, I would view the headwinds and tailwinds on a full year basis at this point as relatively neutral which is good because those two losses we want to -- it\u2019s good that we\u2019re able to overcome that. And we have a lot of potential new business in the pipeline. Our pipeline is solid. What you don\u2019t read about our new business wins within existing multi-national clients, particularly on the healthcare side, those we don\u2019t announce but given the strong capabilities we have both at FCB and McCann, we did see nice wins in those organizations and clients where we do have open architecture structures and those are contributing to our net new business. You just don\u2019t see that, for example in the Alexia\u2019s [ph] releases where she puts the scorecard of net wins and losses, our existing client base continues to be primary source for organic growth for us and that\u2019s not reflected in the new business tables.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.\nSteven Cahall\nThank you. Maybe first a few questions just on the media space; you talked about that as being a growth driver in the quarter. And I know there has been both, some wins and losses over the last few and some pipeline. So, I guess, number one do you expect to be net new business positive in media for the year and expect it to continue to be a growth driver? And then, on the traditional side, I was just wondering, if you\u2019re seeing any fee pressure there? Is that something that we\u2019ve heard about around traditional media buying? And maybe you can tie that into the investments that you talked about earlier and to the extent to which media buying and media planning are now increasingly integrated with the clients or whether they\u2019re splitting that business up? And then, as follow-on, I was just wondering if you could comment on the recent announcement by Google to block ads, and do you think that will have any impact on Cadreon as we move through the year? Thank you.\nMichael Roth\nFirst of all, John, I didn\u2019t answer one of your questions. So, let me get back to that. The question of competition from other sources. Yes, the convergence is out among all different whether it\u2019d be consultants out there; where it\u2019d be the other digitals; whether it\u2019d be the system integrators that are out there that are providing various services. We have not seen them in a big way. Every once in a while, we will see them on the digital side of the business and normally, frankly we do pretty well against them. So, I think, what I mentioned in my remarks is that our integrated offering and our creative firepower is something at this point gives us a strong advantage over those system integrators, if you will. That said, five years or six years from now, the landscape is going to change, maybe potentially you\u2019ll see us partnering with some of these. These are all, it\u2019s a changing anticipating landscape out there, but what we do bring to the table is the firepower on the creative side of the business.\nAnd what we offer to those type of individuals in terms of the diverse client base, innovative thinking, the ability to reach across all the different agencies at IPG, that\u2019s a pretty compelling case to be made for strong creative talent. And we\u2019ve been very successful bringing some real top notch talent within our organization. That coupled with the media side of the business, which we can bring on an integrated offering is something that these other providers don\u2019t have and we use that. And we do believe that the integration of media and creative talent, for example when MullenLowe is doing on the hyper bundling is really what clients are looking for and which is why on the media side of the business we\u2019re seeing a lot of action out there in terms of clients, not clients, actually a lot of the reviews that are out there are not existing clients. And we see the integration as a key factor both in buying and planning, which is why we think our investments in data analytics across all of IPG really position us well in terms of the response what are clients are looking for on the media side of the business.\nSteven Cahall\nAre you increasingly seeing those RFPs tied together between planning as well as the buying?\nMichael Roth\nYes. And right now -- it used to be -- there are still clients out there that bifurcate buying and planning. And because they view -- media guys, I wanted to say this. They view buying as more of a commodity and they\u2019re just looking for the best price. But I think it\u2019s a pretty compelling argument that buying and planning should be together because we can come up with the best media plan there is. And if it isn\u2019t executed properly on the buying side, the effectiveness is really diminished and really is helpful to have the buying media and the planning, sitting in the same room working together. And there are occasions that we do that. So, it\u2019s not that we can\u2019t do it but I think clients are beginning to realize that there is an added value to putting the two of them together. And then, if you add on top of that the ability to bring in our creative and other offerings across the different disciplines, it\u2019s a compelling argument as to why the model that we use, the open architecture model brings the best value as well as the expertise to the clients.\nFee pressure is something is getting a lot of -- since I\u2019ve been in the business, what we\u2019ve been talking about is fee pressure. Whether you call it zero based budgeting, whether you call it value pricing, whatever you want to call it, there is always pressure. Clients want more for less. And if I was a client, I would be doing exactly that. And it\u2019s incumbent to us to show that the work that we do actually moves the needle and which is why the data analytics part, why we\u2019re making such a big strong effort on the centralized data and analytics across all the disciplines with an IPG because that really makes the case that what we do works and it encourages our clients to invest in what we do to move the needle.\nSo, even if it\u2019s a difficult competitive environment, these clients have to spend money on advertising. And if we can show the return on investment for the money that they are spending, they are going to spend it. And although they\u2019ll want -- price it most efficiently and get the best deals as they can, if we can prove that what we\u2019re doing is adding value, then they\u2019re going to spend their money and it\u2019s going to be incumbent on us to make our margins. And frankly you\u2019ve seen us do that. We\u2019ve been talking about price pressures now for years and we continue to expand margin at 50 basis points.\nSo, we still believe the opportunity is there for us to continue to expand margin even with the pressures on the pricing. But there is pressure and it really puts the burden on us to make the case of what we\u2019re doing is effective and efficient for our clients.\nGoogle and ad blocking, I mean that\u2019s -- someone is going to ultimately have to pay for all this stuff. And I know that marketplace like to see everything for nothing but in the end advertisers are going to spend money and they\u2019re going to be -- they want to see the effectiveness. It puts the burden on us to be creative and innovative in storytelling, embedded content, different ways of reaching the consumer, the pop up ad, yes, you\u2019ve got to see that blocked, frankly thank goodness because it gets to be annoying. But we\u2019re much more advanced than that in our business right now. And the embedded content which is why everyone is investing in content and having partnerships on content really makes the case for developing relationship between the clients and the consumers. And that\u2019s really where we shine. We can use our creative capability, our technical capabilities and our distribution to make sure that that content is reaching the consumers with the right message.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of David Joyce from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open\nDavid Joyce\nThank you. I was hoping you could help us think about how much your digital initiatives are helping the growth in the U.S. And then, from a broader perspective, where are your various international operations in rolling out and integrating digital versus where we are?\nMichael Roth\nLook, our digital capabilities are growing historically and overall at double-digit rate. So, it\u2019s a strong engine for our growth. And we don\u2019t -- it\u2019s hard to characterize them as digital agencies anymore. There\u2019s been a convergence among all of our agencies. Our approach to digital has always been that it\u2019s embedded in all of our activities. So, whether you do experiential, whether you do PR, whether you do traditional advertising, digital capabilities is embedded, which is why we don\u2019t have a separate silo as far as digital capabilities. On top of that, we do have digital -- historical digital capabilities in the R/GA a Huge, the MRM, the Proferos. These are original digital agencies, but they cover a broad spectrum of services. R/GA covers creative PR. I mean, they are full service agency candidly, but they have the connected space and the digital capabilities as part of their DNA, which is what makes their offering in Huge and the Proferos and the MRMs compelling, because they bring all of those expertise together. And frankly when they don\u2019t have, they reach out to other assets within IPG to put that all together. So digital is a critical growth. And if you look at where media is being spent, linear TV is not growing as rapidly as digital on the media side. And therefore, if all of our resources aren\u2019t well-versed in digital capabilities, we couldn\u2019t put forth the numbers that we\u2019re seeing. So, digital is going to continue to help grow most of our other businesses. And we make good margin on it. And it\u2019s a great way to develop lasting relationships with clients because that\u2019s where the action is.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. \nPeter Stabler\nGood morning. One for Michael and one for Frank. Michael, wondering if you could give us a little more color on the dispositions, you refer to them as non-strategic. I wonder if there is any sort theme in there. And then, Frank, couple of quarters ago, you talked about, how in terms of contract construction you were generally seeking to lower your exposure to pass-through revenues, given the fact that they can distort growth and the end call them out plus or minus every quarter; just wondering, if you cold update us. Have you seen a meaningful reduction in terms of contract construction in the pass-through; is this contributing to a bit of the margin growth? Wondering if you could help us think about that through the rest of the year. Thanks very much.\nMichael Roth\nYes. On the dispositions, we did indicate that it had an impact of negative 1% on revenue. If you remember, last year, the ended of year, we announced that we were disposing of not-strategic assets. This isn\u2019t exit of a business line that we\u2019ve seen, one of our competitors has that. This is small agencies and geographic regions that frankly they were either losing money or they were not relevant to the offerings, to the entity in which they were residing. So, it\u2019s just basically cleaning up agencies that were not value-added, losing money and strategically not necessary. So, it\u2019s not that we exited the business line; it was in geographic regions that were not efficient for us.\nFrank Mergenthaler\nAnd on a question around contracts, Peter, it primary relates to events business. We are trying to address new clients and move them into an agency relationship as opposed to a principal relationship, existing clients very difficult to shift. So, this will take some time; it\u2019s not having a meaningful impact on margins.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne\nThank you. Good morning. Michael, couple for you. I was curious programmatic was a big buzz word for us a couple of years ago, it\u2019s still a big part of your business. And I guess as a complement to IPG, a lot of your competitors have shifted their model to look like yours and be more of an agency approach. So, now that that\u2019s happened. The bad news is it is perhaps less differentiated of an offer. Can you talk about what you\u2019re doing on the programmatic digital buying front to sort of stay ahead of competition, now that this kind of moves your way, for lack of a better phrase? And then, I had a follow-up.\nMichael Roth\nI\u2019d like to say they see the light. Actually more importantly, the clients have seen the light. This was more or less a response to the fact that what we\u2019ve been saying all along is that we should act as an agent, not as a principal. So, there is an inherent conflict when you\u2019re doing the buyings programmatic, if you\u2019re selling inventory that you have an economic interest in it. And we\u2019ve always said that that we do something we wouldn\u2019t do. And obviously, you\u2019re right. We use that as a differentiator in the various pitches. And clients are beginning to see that they shouldn\u2019t be giving away those profits. And therefore our approach which is a more client-centric approach is the right way to go. And so we\u2019re appreciative of that.\nBut it\u2019s still a very important business for us. Let\u2019s say, we never took inventory. So, therefore it\u2019s still a very high margin business for us. So that means the value service that we\u2019re providing in the programmatic is something that clients appreciate and they\u2019re willing to pay for it. And we\u2019re expanding it on a global basis. Remember, this started out as the US based business and now it\u2019s covering the world. The fact that we pulled out the data analytics and put it into reporting directly into fleet in the US side at the holding company level is indicative that we view this as a very strong component that will differentiate us in the marketplace and will be available, not just to our media businesses but all of our businesses. And when you look at the hyper bundling that we\u2019ve been talking about where media and creative are coming together, this will be viewed as an integral part of the offering that our agencies have. So, I don\u2019t think programmatic dramatic is going away, I think it continues to be a growth vehicle for us. Yes, some clients have been taking it in-house. But this costs a lot of money to continue to evolve; we have to invest in it.\nClients like to have it in-house but when it comes time to looking at efficiencies and investing in it, I think a lot of them will see that some of them may do -- is okay to have in-house but in terms of the changing landscape of programmatic, we offer something that is very difficult to do on an internal basis. So, it would be a combination of the two. So, we still view programmatic as a very important aspect of the business going forward.\nBen Swinburne\nGot it. And then, just as a follow-up more on the macro, you look a lot of the I guess call it soft data out there whether it\u2019s consumer confidence or a small business index, or a lot of the PMI data, still quite bullish. And I think a lot of verticals have been expecting some sort of cyclical balance including advertising, but we\u2019re not really seeing it. I\u2019m curious, you\u2019ve made some comments about sort of the political backdrop. And I\u2019d just love your thoughts as to whether you expect to see the spending trends sort of catch-up with the leading indicators or if this mismatch may persist for a while. I realize you\u2019re not an economist per se, but you talk to large advertisers; we\u2019d love to get your thoughts?\nMichael Roth\nYes. I think everyone is -- we are experiencing everything that you read about. Everyone is expecting this rash of consumer confidence and spending and a lot of it is a function of what\u2019s going to happen frankly in Washington. And so, everyone is waiting and seeing, everyone is expecting to see some change, because obviously that was an important part of the platform. I think they\u2019re beginning to see that it\u2019s a little more difficult than they originally thought. But nonetheless, the consumers are spending, but I think there is some holdback, if you will, in terms of big companies committing to making big investments until these areas are resolved.\nSo, there is disconnect between the market, stock market and the spend. I think potentially, if it all comes together, that will be a good pick-up for us as we go forward, as is tax rate change. I mean, forget about the consumers, just look at IPG, I mean, if you -- we are a tax payer in the U.S. and to the extent that there is a reduction in corporate taxes or individual taxes, which will help to consumers that all benefits us. So, we\u2019re looking [ph] for that. And so I think it\u2019s still a little bit of a wait and see. So, I agree, I think we\u2019re going to still see disconnect there until some of this stuff really comes to fruition.\nBen Swinburne\nThank you.\nMichael Roth\nWe still think that the 3% to 4% that we\u2019re putting out for the year, we do this on a bottoms up basis, and we were not anticipating a big hockey stick in terms of consumer confidence to give the rise to that 3% to 4% growth.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon\nGood morning, everyone. Michael, could we perhaps just return back to parts of your prepared remarks and then earlier questions on competition that the IT companies in particular? And there has been an increasing questions on them specifically. And this isn\u2019t a new trend; we\u2019ve seen a lot of small deals going on for years. It doesn\u2019t seem like there has been a big increase there. But hiring trends are something that we see a little bit less of. So, I was curious if you could go pullback the curtain for us a little bit more, are you hiring more their people; are they hiring more of yours, has that changed whole a lot? And then maybe second, if I could return to the idea of their role in transacting media specifically. Accenture in the past month has been assigned as the sort of the manager of the open AP alliance between the three of other larger sellers of advertising and you also interestingly note that you\u2019ll be their media agency going forward. So, kind of interesting perspective on what they\u2019re doing with a new business on the sales side. But you\u2019re also tied with them shortly on the buy side. I\u2019d be curious about your high level views on how those companies play in media work?\nMichael Roth\nYes. It just shows you, we can all get along. Everybody else would operate the same way. I think we\u2019d be in better shape. Yes. Look, as I say, they are -- look, whether it\u2019d be Accenture or any other consulting and as I say system integrators, they\u2019re buying agencies. And I would do -- you already have the client, you\u2019re doing -- you\u2019re involved in their system integration; and to the extent that you\u2019ve been having add-on from revenue, why not. And so, we do see them as continued competitors if you will in the space. But at this stage, they don\u2019t have the capabilities on the integrated offering that we have. And frankly, and I\u2019ve thrown this out that maybe it\u2019s better if we partner with them than directly compete because we do bring unique expertise that they don\u2019t have yet, and why buy it when you can rent it. So, that\u2019s it. Just I throw that out as a potential. But nonetheless, we compete with them. And so far, we\u2019re doing pretty well against it. And it will be interesting, if they are advising, as you say, the publishers, if you will, sellers of space, it\u2019s hard to be on the other side of that.\nSo, as we say, there is a convergence of everything coming together. And in the end, it\u2019s going to be who has the best capabilities, who has the best insights, and who can bring it all together in a single source. And that\u2019s where I think we have a competitive advantage. We\u2019ve been operating under this open architecture now for 10 years. And frankly we know how to do that. And if you\u2019re sitting on the other side of the table, you can blow your brains out looking at all the different resources that are out there trying to sell you something. And if we can provide a single source capability that\u2019s best in class that puts them all together that\u2019s focused on the client, we don\u2019t have them building the hunt with respect to any of our assets, that\u2019s a pretty compelling case if I was sitting on the other side of the table. So, that\u2019s where we continue to place our bets. And by the way, we are going into the consultancy business. I said this before. But the consultancy part of the business is different.\nWe are -- for example R/GA is already in business transformation, design capabilities, even structural type of advice. So yes, I mean, it\u2019s a logical expansion of the fact that we have relationship with the clients, we know their business and we can really bring to the table creative, new, innovative ideas and call it what you will, partnering with these clients and being able to execute in this complicated environment is something that they want to see. And frankly we\u2019re pretty well suited to do it.\nSo, yes, they\u2019re going to be out there but I think like I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve been expecting it and we\u2019ve been building our assets to compete against it. That said, Accenture is a great client of ours, I\u2019m very happy to have him as a client. I committed to them that we will through the best we have at IPG to helping them achieve their goals and we\u2019re on the same page.\nOperator\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is now open. \nJason Bazinet\nThanks. Just a question for Mr. Roth. When I think of a company that\u2019s not growing super quickly, you can see working capital go negative, positive, but it usually nets out to zero if you give a firm enough time. And when I look to the sort of late-90s to 2006, that\u2019s indeed what happened at IPG, it\u2019s positive, negative; positive, negative but it netted out to zero. The last ten years sort of 2006 to 2016, it was sort of minus $1 billionish. And over that same period, you generated about $3.7 billion of cash flows, so large as a percentage of your cash generation. Is there something indicative of how the business is changed in the 20-year period where it has become more working capital intensive or am I just looking at sort of the wrong two 10-year periods and drawing erroneous conclusions? Thanks.\nMichael Roth\nWell, I think the aspect of the media business has changed dramatically. And I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s driving -- and that\u2019s why you see the seasonality of our own cash flows because a lot of our ins and outs on the cash flows is as a result of media. So, I think that had a big impact. Frankly, I\u2019m not as familiar about it -- I\u2019m new to this business relatively. So, the 10 years that you were talking about, I was a tax lawyer. But, right now, I think it\u2019s a media business that\u2019s driving the cash flows and it\u2019s -- and we\u2019ve done a tremendous job in terms of working with our clients and working with our -- focus on cash flow. We\u2019re not a bank. And it\u2019s a critical component of returns.\nSo, I think we\u2019re much better at it than we were 10 years ago as well. It wasn\u2019t the kind of focus that was -- in the end though, yes, we are generating a lot of cash flow; it\u2019s a good. The good news about IPG is that that cash flow we\u2019re returning to our shareholders. We didn\u2019t go out and do big transactions; that\u2019s another difference. In the all days, IPG and the other holding companies and there are some still do it, buy everything that\u2019s out there. And frankly, we were not participating in that. So, we took the excess cash flow in our business and we returned it to our shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. So, there aren\u2019t any big transactions out there that we see that when we really have to use all of that cash to do. If there are, we\u2019ll look at it as any other transaction. But I think -- I hope that helps. But that\u2019s the dynamics of our business for example.\nJason Bazinet\nDo you think on a go forward basis, if you go out long enough that the working capital on relations will be zero or do you think it sort of\u2026\nMichael Roth\nEventually, of course, and unless the dynamics of our industry change dramatically which frankly we\u2019re not going to do. So, that\u2019s the gist of your question. Clients would like us to be a bank but we\u2019re not.\nOperator\nThank you, speakers. You may go ahead and proceed.\nMichael Roth\nOkay. Well, thank you very much. As I said, this is the first quarter. We\u2019ve got a lot of work ahead of us and we are keeping our heads down to deliver on our results. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nThis concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you and you may disconnect at this time.\n\n",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded on April 22nd, 2021.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead sir. \nDave Cresci\nGood morning and welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will review the highlights for the quarter; Chris Concannon, President and COO will discuss automation and product expansion; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results.\nBefore I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.\nFor a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2020. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website.\nNow, let me turn the call over to Rick. \nRick McVey\nThank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. First quarter revenue reached a new quarterly record of $195 million, up 16%; operating income of $103 million was up 14%; and EPS of $2.11 was up 8%.\nRecord revenue was driven primarily by market share gains in our core credit products. New quarterly volume records were set for total credit trading volume as well as new volume records for high-yield trading, emerging markets, Eurobonds, and municipal bonds.\nOpen trading volumes grew 20% year-over-year and estimated transaction cost savings delivered to our clients were $197 million. International client volume was up 18% and reached a new record of $237 billion.\nIt is important to remember that in Q1 last year, we had five full weeks of elevated credit market activity due to the onset of the pandemic. In light of the significant difference in market conditions this year, we feel very good about the volume, revenue, and earnings growth this quarter.\nSlide four provides an update on market conditions. The top left chart displays just how different the market environment was one year ago. Our business thrives when credit spread volatility increases. During Q1 last year, credit spread volatility was 10 times greater than this year and credit spreads in high-grade were nearly 200 basis points wider.\nNew issue activity was strong during the quarter and similar to last year. TRACE volumes in high-grade were up 7% in Q1 reflecting a continuing trend toward higher secondary market turnover. Average years to maturity for investment-grade bonds traded on the system continues to climb and reach the high end of the historical range at 10 years this quarter.\nSlide five provides an update on Open Trading. Our market-leading all-to-all marketplace Open Trading set new records this quarter with an average of 34,000 orders per day totaling over $19 billion in notional value per day in credit products. High grade, high-yield, and emerging markets all show healthy open trading volume increases in excess of 20%.\nDealer initiated open-trading orders were up 78% year-over-year. Our D2D business now represents 8% of our credit trading volume and 7% of credit trading revenue as we compete effectively in this client segment with more traditional D2D competitors through open trading.\nThis quarter, two-thirds of our system-wide open orders traded with a traditional dealer counterparty, while one-third found price improvement in Open Trading. Open Trading ADV reached a new record of $4 billion per day, up 22% year-over-year. For the fifth quarter in a row, estimated transaction cost savings of $197 million delivered to our clients were in excess of total company credit trading revenue.\nNow, let me turn the call over to Chris, to provide an update on product and client expansion.\nChris Concannon\nThank you, Rick. Slide 6 highlights our international growth and product expansion. Throughout the past year, we have remained focused on bolstering our global footprint and expanding our product offerings. I will touch on a few of these initiatives today.\nOur international growth continues with an 18% year-over-year increase in international client volumes, driven by over 900 active clients across our global products. In the first quarter, US credit volume from international clients was up 23%. Emerging markets volume increased by 22% and Eurobond volumes increased by 13%.\nOur ongoing investment in Asia Pacific region delivered an increase in the number of clients and significant gains in volume. Client credit volume from the region grew to $29 billion, up 57% from the first quarter of 2020, as the number of clients in the region also grew by 14% over the past year. We are encouraged by the progress we are making outside the US and we believe, we are well positioned to capture a larger share of trading in the growing global credit markets.\nIn the area of product expansion, we continue to see momentum in our municipal bond offering. In the first quarter, we again hit record volumes with a total of $5.8 billion in municipal bond volumes, up 75% from a year ago. We also released -- recently closed on the acquisition of MuniBrokers, a central electronic venue, serving large banks and inter-dealer brokers in the municipal bond market. The acquisition expands our connectivity with dealers and provides rich content for our growing Muni client business.\nOur post-trade business, an important contributor to our data strategy, continues to grow with organic post-trade revenue up 50% in the first quarter, driven largely by new client additions and our SFTR offering. We now have over 950 unique post-trade clients. The integration of our recently acquired Regulatory Reporting Hub is well underway and is extending our leading regulatory reporting business across Europe, while further strengthening our data capabilities and our post-trade services.\nSlide 7 demonstrates our continued momentum of automation in Credit Trading. Automated trading and dealers automated responses continue to grow across the platform. Automated trading volumes rose to $39 billion in the first quarter, up from $31 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Auto-X trade count also grew in the quarter to 205,000, up 37% from the prior year. 95 firms utilized our Auto-X functionality in the quarter, up from 84 in Q1 of last year, while 22 firms used our Auto-Responder functionality.\nWe are also seeing healthy adoption of Auto-X across investment grade, Eurobonds, high-yield and emerging markets. The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform, with approximately 4.8 million algo responses in the first quarter, up 57% from the same period last year. The growth in the average number of responses per inquiry has resumed, following a decline in the first half of last year. The increasing responses, ultimately improves the likelihood of execution across the platform.\nAs the overall share of electronic trading grows in global credit, we are seeing continued demand for and growth in our automated trading solutions. We are continuing to develop innovative automated trading solutions in collaboration with our buy and sell-side clients and I look forward to sharing updates to our offering in the coming quarters.\nSlide 8, provides a summary of our trade environment across product categories. Our US high-grade volumes were up 10% year-over-year to $363 billion for the quarter, largely due to an increase in market volumes and market share gains. Estimated US high-grade market volumes were up 7%, while estimated share increased -- market share increased by 0.5 percentage point\u2019s year-over-year to 20.5%.\nVolumes in our other credit category were up 19% year-over-year to $391 billion for the quarter and we achieved record quarterly trading volume in high yield emerging markets, Eurobonds and municipal bonds. Market share gains account for the vast majority of the increase across each product category with US high-yield volume up 21%, emerging markets volume up 18%, Eurobond volume up 15% and municipal bonds up 75%. \nOur rates business maintained its dealer-to-dealer market share compared to Q4 of 2020 and we are beginning to see volume contribution from both our new dealer-to-client trading protocol and our recently launched hedging initiatives. Over 150 clients are now approved for our click-to-trade rates offering. \nRegarding April activity with seven full days of trading left in April, it is far too early to draw any conclusions on the full month. However, TRACE market volumes are currently running below Q1 levels and our market share is maintaining levels similar to Q1. \nNow let me turn the call over to Tony to provide an update on our financials. \nTony DeLise\nThank you, Chris. On slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Revenue was a record $195 million, up 16% year-over-year. The 14% increase in credit trading volume led to a 13% uplift in commissions. \nPost-trade services revenue more than doubled to $10.3 million and includes $4 million of trade reporting revenue from clients added through the Regulatory Reporting Hub acquisition. \nOperating income was up 14% year-over-year and operating margin was 53% in the first quarter. EBITDA hit a record quarterly level in the quarter. Other expense was $1.6 million in the first quarter and includes foreign currency transaction losses of $500,000. Absent unpredictable items like foreign currency transaction and investment gains and losses, we would expect other expense to run around $1 million per quarter. \nThe effective tax rate was 21% in the first quarter and reflects $4 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Inclusive of the recently enacted increase in the New York state corporate tax rate, we are maintaining our full year effective tax rate guidance range of 22% to 24%. \nOn slide 10, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 15% year-over-year. On a composite basis, the majority of the 17% increase in credit transaction fees was driven by estimated market share gains. The decline in rates transaction fees was due to lower US treasury's trading volume, principally resulting from a decline in estimated dealer-to-dealer market volumes. \nUS high-grade fee per million was down $7 versus the fourth quarter level, but $4 higher year-over-year. There were several factors contributing to the sequential decline in fee capture including a shift in trade size. The duration impact on US high-grade fee capture was muted on a sequential quarterly basis as longer years to maturity on bonds traded over the platform was offset by higher bond yields. Our other credit category fee per million of $202 was similar to both the fourth quarter 2020 and first quarter 2020 levels. Product mix along with fee capture at the individual product level was very consistent across these periods. \nSlide 11 provides you with the expense detail. First quarter expenses were up 18% year-over-year and include $3.6 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and non-recurring integration costs related to the Regulatory Reporting Hub business. Excluding the regulatory Reporting Hub activity, expenses were up 14% year-over-year and up 11% on a constant currency basis. \nThe rise in compensation and benefits was due to an increase in headcount of 74 personnel in support of our growth initiatives. The increase in professional and consulting expenses is due to a variety of factors including M&A transaction and integration costs and consulting costs associated with our clearing and settlement transition projects. Higher depreciation and amortization reflects the continuing investment in product development, along with the amortization of acquired intangibles. While Open Trading volume increased 20%, overall clearing costs were down 15%. \nIn March, we completed the second phase of our settlement project with the transition to a new settlement agent in the UK. Although, we expect to realize some further cost improvements over the balance of this year, I'm happy to report that third-party clearing costs measured on a per ticket basis declined by over 35% year-over-year. \nAs Chris mentioned, we closed on the MuniBrokers acquisition on April 9th. We expect MuniBrokers expenses will be around $4 million in 2021, 50% of which will be amortization of acquired intangibles. We are updating our full year expense guidance range to $370 million to $386 million to incorporate the MuniBrokers expense activity.\nOn Slide 12 we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments were $415 million at March 31 and trailing 12 months free cash flow reached $340 million. During the first quarter, we paid out year-end employee bonuses and related taxes of roughly $50 million and a quarterly cash dividend of $25 million. We also repurchased 54,000 shares during the quarter, the majority of which were associated with the investing of employee stock awards. We didn't borrow against the revolving credit facility in the first quarter and ended the period with over $300 million of excess net capital resident at MarketAxess Corp, our regulated self-clearing entity. Based on the first quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.66 regular quarterly dividend.\nNow let me turn the call back to Rick.\nRick McVey\nThank you, Tony. Market share gains across all credit products and all geographic regions drove our record results in Q1. Trading automation is advancing in credit products with both dealer and investor clients and MarketAxess Open Trading is leading the way. We continue to invest actively in new product areas like municipal bonds, government bonds and Asia emerging markets to sustain long-term growth. We are also pleased with the progress we are making with new electronic trading protocols.\nNow, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. You may begin.\nRich Repetto\nYes. Good morning, Rick and Tony and Chris. I guess the question is on the fee per million. And slide 4 helps -- it shows the yield to maturity. But I guess the question is Tony, can you review the drivers? We know that duration trade size and mix. But -- and we're just trying to see the moving parts. And if it's easy to compare quarter-to-quarter I believe rather than year-over-year because the big change in yields occurred between 4Q and 1Q I believe? Are you -- can you explain whatever is easier -- easiest that we can understand it I guess?\nTony DeLise\nYes. Happy to do that, Rich. So Rich, you're right that there's lots of factors that influence the high-grade fee capture. And we're really talking about investment-grade here. And years to maturity matters yields matter. We have a tiered fee plan. So trade size matters. We have the mix of dealers that are participating. So for example, dealers that are on a distribution fee plan versus dealers that are on an all variable plan, the fee capture looks different. Even when it comes to protocol, it may look different.\nOpen Trading, fee capture is slightly different than disclosed request for quote. Some of the newer protocols of fee capture is different. So there's a lot of moving parts here. But Rich, you're right. Looking at say Q4 versus Q1, that's probably the best way to describe it. And when you look at those two periods, fee capture was down about $7 per million. A couple of items in there. Trade size was one of them. Not a big influencer, but trade size did tend to shift to a little bit larger trade size as our fee capture is a little bit lower.\nDealer mix. So when we look at dealers that are on all variable plans versus fixed plans, a little bit heavier weighting to dealers on fixed plans, fee capture a little bit lower. But the item you mentioned which is very interesting, as Rick picked it up on in his comments, we're at -- close to the post credit crisis high on years to maturity of bonds traded over the platform. Typically, that would result in higher fee capture dollar value of the basis points higher with longer years to maturity. But in this case, what offset the years to maturity was the fact that yields were up. So again, you're right, you look at fourth quarter to first quarter, you did see a rise in bond yields. So those two were largely offsetting.\nOne last thing because I'm getting -- I'm on the clock right now. One last thing just sensitivity going forward every year to maturity is around $10 to $15 per million all things being equal. A 1% change in yields across the yield curve again about a $10 to $15 per million all things -- all else being equal.\nRich Repetto\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question will come from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. You may begin.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy\nHey, good morning guys. So I think portfolio trading is up to around 5% of high-grade and high-yield trading volume in recent months. What's driving this adoption by the buyer side? And can you provide an update on MarketAxess efforts to develop a client solution in this area?\nRick McVey\nSure. I'll be happy to start on that Patrick. Thank you for the question. But, yes, you did see growth again in the first quarter in portfolio trading. And I think that situationally clients and dealers are finding good opportunities to use the workflow solutions around portfolio trading for efficiency and execution. And there are a variety of different cases where dealers can promote inventory in baskets to clients, which in an environment like this has been very popular from both sides.\nYou have certain transactions that involves offsetting buys and sells where the combined risk of the basket is less than it would be in individual bonds and can sometimes create efficient execution for both sides. You've also seen trades where investors are making room for new issues through portfolio trading, so a variety of different case studies.\nAnd March was an unusually active month for portfolio trading. It's tapered off from what we can see on the TRACE tape in April so far, but very large month in March. We continue to work on our workflow solution there. We are very confident that we are closing the gaps that we have and we'll be competitive in this space. At the same time we're making very large investments in our liquidity solutions through open trading and in new product areas.\nSo it's a convenient workflow solution. It's -- they're a subset of very large dealers that are active a subset of very large clients limited client community but growing importance in the market and it's something that we expect to be competitive in throughout 2021 and beyond. \nChris Concannon\nAnd Rick I'll just add that we are rolling out enhancements to our portfolio trading solution this quarter and the coming quarters including things like -- critically important things like net hedging that will be available to portfolio trades. The other thing worth mentioning is we are seeing activity in our dealer RFQ platform on Open Trading, which is likely resulting from the liquidation of portfolios that dealers are trading into.\nSo we are getting collateral benefit on the platform particularly in Open Trading and things like investment grade and high yield as a result of these very large block trades that are going up on TRACE and then we're seeing those dealer liquidations happening on the platform.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy\nThat\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question will come from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. You may begin.\nDan Fannon\nThanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up a bit more on some of the market share trends year-to-date and the detail on slide 4 highlights some of the macro factors. But as you think about volatility maybe being a bit more depressed and the work-from-home environment ending as things normalize, how are you thinking about kind of the trajectory of market share from here?\nRick McVey\nYes, I'll start but -- thanks for the question Dan. But listen when we look at broadly at market share trends we're really encouraged by what we see in the first quarter even though as you've point out, market volatility across most credit products was significantly lower than it had been much -- for much of last year. It's coming through most clearly year-over-year gains in high-yield and emerging markets.\nHigh grade a little bit more developed market electronically is going to have ebbs and flows based on volatility. And especially with the ETFR community where you would have seen them very active a year ago at high volatility levels and they are always less active in low volatility environments. But beyond that when we look under the hood at the trends that we see with investment managers hedge funds dealers using Open Trading international clients, it's all very encouraging for long-term market share gains. And we have no control over the quarter-to-quarter market conditions. But if you look historically at our consistent growth and success over almost 17 years of being a public company, we've been able to show sustainable long-term growth through any environment.\nSo our expectation is that we have lots of reason for optimism because of the liquidity solutions that we are delivering and the significant transaction cost savings to see share gains through any environment and that is certainly what we saw in the first quarter of this year.\nDan Fannon\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question will come from the line of Ari Ghosh from Credit Suisse. You may begin.\nAri Ghosh\nHey, good morning everyone. So I just wanted to come back to some of your new initiatives and rollouts, especially as institutional participation continues to improve this year. Specifically I appreciate any color around the traction that you're seeing around Live Markets and then also the opportunity for market access in China just given that there's been some recent regulatory changes and relaxation of requirements for investors. So just trying to think about how you scale that opportunity and time lines around when you think that may start rolling into your numbers in a meaningful manner? Thanks so much.\nChris Concannon\nWell, great question. So on live markets I'll start. We're seeing more activity on Live Markets and it's quite encouraging, because it is a brand new protocol to the credit space. And what we have seen is we've got 19 dealers live on the platform. We expect to have new announcements around designated market makers on the platform as well. We would likely have up to three designated market makers. Those are fully committed two-sided market makers on the platform and we expect to have announcements around that in the coming quarter, very encouraging signs on the size of trades on Live Markets.\nRight now our average trade size on Live Markets is $2 million, which is much larger than your traditional RFQ average on the platform. So we're encouraged that there is sizable live liquidity with two-way markets and over 250 Q-sips across the platform.\nSo, again, it's a new protocol. The changes in workflow and trading behavior by clients is a sizable lift. But the liquidity that's building on the platform is encouraging. And the opportunity for clients to join a bid or an offer and not cross spread is growing as that liquidity on Live Markets grow. I'll let Rick cover our recent activities in Asia and the growth of our volumes there. \nRick McVey\nSure. We highlighted in the prepared remarks that we're really encouraged by the developments we see with our APAC business. And part of it is organic where we see more dealers and investor clients embracing electronic trading and trading consistently across the platform. Part of it we hear back from dealers is a view that our competitive position has gotten even stronger in EM globally and particularly in the Asia region. So really good news there in terms of the trends in EM broadly in very large markets.\nWith respect to China, I think, that it's very clear that they will continue to take additional steps to open up their fixed income markets. And given the presence we have with global investors in our EM franchise, we know that we can play a significant role in bringing investor order flow into China. And we're also encouraged by southbound traffic where it's likely that investors within China will be trading more actively outside of China.\nSo we would expect to be more involved in that market. We are taking the steps to be eligible to do so, and we're hopeful that our presence in EM is going to make a significant contribution to the Chinese goal of opening up their fixed income markets.\nAri Ghosh\nGreat. Thanks so much.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.\nAlex Blostein\nHey good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Just sticking with some of the new initiatives, Chris you highlighted muni markets. I was hoping to dig into that a little bit more. Can you provide us, I guess maybe some specifics around what MarketAxess is doing in order to enable greater pace of electronification in the muni market today? What are some of the biggest hurdles? Obviously, it feels like there's a lot of inertia in that space. I'm trying to think how you guys are trying to break through that? And how much of the muni market do you think could ultimately become electronically traded? \nChris Concannon\nSure. I'll tackle that one. Well, I continue to be excited about the muni market and our opportunity there. You're talking about a very large market, a difficult market to trade because of the breadth of product in that market. Data analytics will prove to be very helpful in the muni market as we break down the more manual parts of the market and add electronic trading. I'm encouraged by our growth in munis. Obviously the 75% year-over-year increase in that market is encouraging.\nAlso, I'm encouraged by the size of our all-to-all market in munis. So all-to-all is proving to be a very important component to our growth rate. It's now 43% of our volume in munis. The other areas that -- we're seeing areas like dealer RFQ in munis grow over 170% year-over-year. So we are seeing dealers using our platform similar to the way they would use an inter-dealer market -- inter dealer broker market.\nWe obviously have closed the acquisition of MuniBrokers that's approximately 4% of the muni market heavily weighted towards exempt Munis. So we're working on the integration of that market and we plan to have that integrated more largely in 2021. I do think as you think about that market there's sizable costs to large investors to maintain their large -- small trade size across the muni market. And we're seeing investments from the large investment managers to reduce their costs in that market similar to the way they've embraced electronic trading across their investment-grade high-yield trading guests. So we just see that trend continuing.\nWe see getting higher penetration rates in those large client flows in the muni market. I can't predict how far it goes. But given the small ticket sizes the complexity of the market I would expect high dependency on electronic solutions for the years to come.\nTony DeLise\nAnd Alex just one last thing just on the size of the market. And think about where we are today. We're at about 2% market share. And we've talked about this before in terms of revenue opportunity. For us every 1% of share equates to about $10 million in annual revenue. We don't know where this will end up in terms of electronic adoption, but you can do a little math around it. If half the market goes electronic this is an enormous opportunity. That's why we're so focused on it. That's how we continue to invest. That's all part of the strategy around bringing on board MuniBrokers. So big opportunity ahead of us. \nAlex Blostein\nYes. For sure, it\u2019s overcrowded. Thanks.\nOperator\nOur next question will come from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. You may begin.\nMichael Cyprys\nFor taking the question. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about block trades, maybe some of the initiatives you have there to further penetrate that. Where you stand today in terms of a block trade penetration? And how you're seeing client behavior change around that?\nRick McVey\nSure. I'm happy to take a start on that, Mike. Thank you. But listen, it's an important part of the market. We're investing in new solutions to address blocks, and we're seeing good progress in some areas as well. And I would point to high-yield in particular, where for many years, almost all of our volume was in odd lot trade sizes. And if you see the big jump year-over-year in high-yield share, the majority of that is driven by more success in what is considered to be block size trades in high-yield over $1 million.\nSo we've moved our market share up primarily by investors and dealers in high yield getting more comfortable with large trade sizes. In high grade, we've been pretty flat around the 10% area lately. Clearly, live markets is intended to attack part of the block trading market in very liquid bonds, where both new issues and benchmark deals trade actively in block size, and very tight bid offer. And we're encouraged as you heard Chris say about some of the developments in Live Markets that we think over the coming quarters are going to make that a viable new addition to activity on our trading platform, and especially in blocks.\nChris Concannon\nAnd I'll just add Rick that, we have a very unique view of the credit market. And we have been developing a number of data solutions that help traders identify the true depth of the market, things like our tradeability data solution. So we do think, we can be super helpful to the average trade desk, when they're determining true size of a block, and how to engage the market. And we do think that will attract larger-sized orders on our platform when we can define for them. What the execution could be, execution costs for that block and the true depth of the market, at the moment in time they want to trade.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. You may begin.\nBrian Bedell\nThanks. Good morning. If I can squeeze a two parter in here. I apologize, I joined a few minutes late. But just on -- back to the high-grade market share question, given the growth initiatives, and a pretty good client traction that you have across the different protocols, including Auto-X, and the transaction savings given that versus the challenges of the lower volatility as a sort of a more of a macro headwind. When do you -- maybe --start to answer but when do you think you could cross those initiatives and client traction could outweigh that headwind of volatility as we sort of move through 2021 in terms of having a year-over-year gain in high-grade market share? And then the second part is just -- I don't think you talked about this Chris yet, but just an update on the green bond trading as that seems to be gaining momentum globally.\nRick McVey\nWell, I'll start on the volatility question, and then I'm sure Chris would like to update you on the green bond initiative and client adoption as well. But listen volatility comes and goes in every market, right? So yes, it's temporarily a headwind in credit. It's not to say that, it will be that way next week, or next month, or next quarter. So we do have a goldilocks scenario right now, where people are quite optimistic on economic growth for the quarters ahead and that leads to better credit quality among a lot of corporate bond issuers.\nBut our business keeps getting more diversified, right? So, our European business is more important than ever. We talked about Asia global EM is loaded with opportunities. All of them have different cycles and volatility characteristics along the way that, it's not something that we worry that much about. We would not have encouraged anybody last spring to use those volatility levels as the new normal and we would not encourage you today to leave -- to use current levels as the new normal either.\nAnd what we do is focus on the long-term is -- and that's where we've had great success is investing in important trading protocols and new markets around the world and new clients onboarding, and there's a lot of that going on right now. And there's a lot of reason to believe that over the coming quarters, there are multiple factors that could increase volatility. So, it's a short-term headwind, but we're not -- it's not something we have sussed over because we've been through all kinds of market environments over the last 17 years.\nChris Concannon\nAnd I'll just add, just when it comes to long-term growth rates. We are encouraged by the growth of fixed income ETFs. We clearly have correlation to some of the growth around fixed income ETFs and the trading of fixed income ETFs. And that long-term growth is underway and quite powerful as you look at the numbers that AUM pouring into fixed income ETFs globally.\nOne reflection of that is in investment-grade in the first quarter our Open Trading, which is an important component of the fixed income, ETFR grew 24% in Q1 over 2020. So, important fundamental growth rates are happening even in the face of macro wins.\nWith regard to green bonds, we're doing a lot of exciting things in the whole ESG area. I'll note that our ESG report is now live up on our website. So, please take a look. There's been a lot of work into that report. And it reflects all the different things we're doing as a company, but also some of the things that we're doing for our client investors who trade green bonds.\nFirst quarter Green Bond volume was $13 billion. So we continue to see increases on our platform in Green Bonds. More importantly, we launched last year the Green Bond -- the trading for trees initiative. So, not only are we benefiting from the growth of Green Bonds trading on our platform, but we're taking a stand in the environment and planting trees.\nWe planted 65,000 trees in the first quarter. That's on top of what we planted in 2020, which was 130,000 trees. So, we continue to see a progress there -- and we have a small fire alarm test going on in our background, so please ignore that. But trees are being planted, Green Bonds are being traded. And we're super excited about what we can do in that environment.\nBrian Bedell\nVery great, and thanks for all this color.\nRick McVey\nThe last thing I'll say is that the other trend that's important for all of you to keep an eye on is the increase in trading velocity that's taking place in credit. And a variety of factors for that, right? All-to-all trading is bringing a lot of new market participants into credit trading many for the first time. So you have a new base of market makers a new base of systematic credit investors. They are clearly adding to the mix around trading velocity. And then you see all-to-all trading reducing transaction costs which also traditionally will increase velocity.\nSo lots of reasons to be optimistic that we could see higher levels of market turnover in global credit as all client segments seem to be embracing greater levels of electronic trading and trading automation.\nBrian Bedell\nThat makes sense. Thank you so much.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Sean Horgan from Rosenblatt. You may begin.\nSean Horgan\nHey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about, hiring plans for the year. How many new hires are you targeting for 2021? And how many of those are -- will be technology hires?\nTony DeLise\nYes, sure Sean, I'm happy to take the question. And a big component of our expenses it is compensation and benefits. It's more than 50% of our cost. And this year as we entered the year, we were looking to add somewhere around 60 or 70 personnel.\nAnd the majority of that -- the vast majority of that would be in the technology space. We've got -- when you look at where we ended the first quarter with around 610 people we've got -- just to put in perspective, right now we've got about -- line of sight on 50 roles with names attached to those roles.\nAnd about half of those are part of our college grad program, but we've got line of sight on around 50 roles today. So we feel pretty good about hitting that target of adding 60 personnel or 70 personnel over the balance of the full year.\nSean Horgan\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd our next question will come from line Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. You may begin.\nAri Ghosh\nThis is my follow-up guys. Tony just a quick clean up item and again apologies if I missed this one, but just looking at the 1Q non-op expense of that $1.7 million. I'm wondering if that's a good starting point for 2Q. I know there's a commitment fee here in the numbers but I was wondering if the other moving parts that might drop off next quarter? Thanks so much.\nTony DeLise\nYes, sure Ari. And I know it's been a challenge to predict that line item. There's a variety of non-operating items in there. So you've got foreign currency transaction gains a lot hard to predict that one.\nYou've got unrealized and realized gains and losses on the investment portfolio. Again hard to predict, there are items like our credit facility fees in there as well. But it was around $1.6 million in the first quarter. That did have some foreign currency transaction losses in there.\nAbsent these unpredictable items -- this is what I had in the prepared remarks, absent the unpredictable items, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, unrealized and realized gains and losses on the investment portfolio. We think it's going to be about $1 million per quarter.\nThat's where it would have been in the first quarter, that's where it would have been in the fourth quarter. Again, absent these unpredictable items, that's where we think it will be over the balance of the year.\nAri Ghosh\nGot it. Thanks so much.\nOperator\nThank you. And there are no further questions. So I'll turn the call over to, Rick McVey for any closing comments.\nRick McVey\nThank you for joining us this morning. And we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\n\n",

Morris - Chairman, President, and CEO\nHolly Koeppel - EVP and CFO\nAnalysts\nAshar Khan - SAC Capital\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates\nJohn Kiani - Deutsche Bank\nAnthony Crowdell - Jefferies & Co\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs\nShalini Mahajan - UBS\nPaul Ridzon - KeyBanc\nElizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch & Co.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Electric Power First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions].\nI'll now turn the conference over to Julie Sherwood, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Sherwood - Director, Investor Relations\nThanks, Kathy. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss AEP's 2008 first quarter earnings. If you've not seen the press release issued earlier today, it's available on our web page at aep.com. In addition to the financial schedules included in the press release, the webcast of this call will include visuals of charts and graphics referred to by AEP management during the call. An investor information packet is also available at aep.com that includes the consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows as well as full income statements for our utility operations, MEMCO operations, generation and marketing and parent and all other.\nThe earnings release and other matters that may be discussed on the call today contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the SEC filings including the most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for discussion of the factors that may cause results to differ from management projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.\nAlso on the call, we will discuss the measures about company performance, that is ongoing earnings versus reported earnings that differ from those recognized by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website at aep.com.\nI'll now turn the proceedings over to Mike Morris, Chairman, President and CEO of the company to lead an opening presentation and then we will have time for your questions.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks a lot Julie. Unfortunately, Julie Sloat isn't here with us today. I am sure she is on the phone with us; she is home with a high fever and wishes that she could be here. I know that you have seen the press release and the data, its easy for us to say that we have had an excellent first quarter 2008, we feel like we are off to a very, very solid start and that makes us feel very comfortable about reaffirming our guidance for 2008 of between $2.10 to $3.30 a share.\nWe have had as many of you know from meetings we've held all along a very productive regulatory first quarter receiving $481 million of the $518 million worth of rate adjustments that we had forecasted for the year. Ohio, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia Oklahoma are all reflective of new rates put in effect as of the first quarter 2008, that leaves Kentucky and Indiana, which are both pending. So, we feel very comfortable about where we stand in the rate arena. As I will skip the Ohio developments because, I want to spend more time talking that at the end of the slide that they've provided me to talk from.\nThe fact of the matter is and the new generation world [ph], the Turk Plant continues to move forward, we have had a series of discussions in the open forum with the Texas Public Utility Commission, we filed additional papers with them and they will have some additional hearings on the Turk Plant and we would expect an order some time in the month of May from the commission itself.\nAgain we feel relatively comfortable about where we stand there. Obviously the air permit in Arkansas is of great issue and importance to us and we expect to receive a favorable air permit authority some time yet in 2008 and to move forward with ultra super critical coal plant which will satisfy SWEPCO's energy needs.\nAs you know in the first quarter on the integrated gas combined cycle we have been on the roller coaster with a very, very favorable West Virginia order to go forward with the plant that's intended to be added to the footprint at Mountaineer and then somewhat of a disappointing order out of the Virginia Corporation Commission, where they were not comfortable with the technology, the cost of the technology or the assuredness of the price of that technology going forward.\nIt's our intention to petition for rehearing in Virginia to try to lay out a clear path for them in the state of Virginia and see if we can't receive a more favorable ruling from them, yet this year to go forward with integrated gas plant there. I think all of you know from conversations we have had that the Ohio existing integrated gas combined cycle application is back in front of the commission on remand from the Ohio Supreme Court.\nTransmission activities continue to encourage the 14.3 return on equity granted to our partnership with Alageini [ph] and the project that we now call CAF [ph] is very supportive of the plans that we have in place. We are working on alignments and filings that would be required at the state level to receive siding authority and continue to move forward on that project as well. Other partnerships in Michigan and SBP and other areas continue to be developed, and we will talk about those as they get a more concrete in the very near term.\nLet me move to Ohio and try to give you our view of what the legislature has placed in front of Governor Strickland, I can appreciate that when we get to the Q's and As there will be probably, considerably more interest in this.\nI think you have all had an opportunity to read it and be involved in much of the give and take of the process. We are encouraged by the concept that there are 2 options, the market rate option, which is the blend of some percent of your current fleet going to market and the remainder of your fleet being blended in at then RSP rate adjusted for fuel and other issues that one might file in an R and MRO filing. The ESP approach would start out with the RSP rate that we know, I add adjustments for prudently incurred fuel cost and another factor that you would file to cover any other cost that you see going forward.\nClearly as we look at the two paths, we find positive in each of them, and it well might be because we are duty bound to file an ESP and that we may in fact file both of those approaches as we go, which is to say, the option, that says you can not only have an ESP, but you can top it off with a market rate option filing as well.\nWhen we look at the pluses over the minuses of the overall legislation it's clear that under the MRO you can move to market over that 5 year period, you can also of course on the ESP path, that allows for significant flexibility, reduce regulatory lag, on many capital investments that need to be made in generation, transmission and distribution and of course an automatic tracker of your fuel cost as you go forward.\nThere is a price cap mechanism on what is now in Ohio called the Advanced Energy Requirement which is very different from renewable portfolio standards that you are seeing in other jurisdictions, and should you find an impact from adding those activities to your overall cost that bump up against cap you are relieved from going forward and doing those kinds of issues.\nWe are very encouraged by the inclusion of rate deferrals and securitization. Should you get to a point where the regulator believes that you have bumped up against what are reasonable increases in the cost of energy for your customers here in Ohio, as you know that is something that American Electric Power has been very much in favor of all along has we go. We are also encouraged by the fact that the law moves forward trying to encourage utilities to make additional capital investments in Ohio, we think that's healthy.\nOn the negative side there is no question that PUCO has been given wide ranging authority to make adjustments as you implement in the second and third and fourth years of your plan, that is a bit disquieting but some thing that we feel comfortable we could work around, as we make the filings in the first instance and then of course there is an excess earnings test.\nThe excess earnings test which was developed with a lot of thought and a pretty wide ranging test, is there and it is of concern and should be of concern. However, we think that it's tempered a great deal by the comparables. Make no mistake, that some people are misreading the excess earnings test to simply say that it is similarly situated utilities, when in fact the languages is quite clear that it is publicly traded companies parent including utilities close parent. We think that that cadre of comparables with risk profile and capital adjustments would make comfortable room for an equity earnings comparator in the high teens without much difficulty.\nSo the bottom line of how we see the legislation in Ohio, which we understand the governor's office is prepared to sign in the not too distant future is that it gives us some comfort to continue to stay with our guidance that we gave to you last October for calendar year '08, 09, and 2010. However, we won't really know much about the latter of those years including 2011 until we see how the filing that we make in the near term so that we fall inside of the timeline for the commission to deal with our applications in calendar year '08 for implementation on 01-01-09, we wont be able to give you much more clarity about that.\nAs you know should we pass the calendar year and there is no implementation, you can simply move forward and implement another cycle on your current rate stabilization plan, so we don't fall into never-never land if we don't finish our materials by 12-31-09.\nSo with that I will turn it over for a little more granularity on the first quarter to Holly and then we are surely going to be prepared to address the issues that are of concern to you. Thanks. Holly.\nHolly Koeppel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnd in the interest of getting quickly to the Q&A, I will cover at a high level the quarterly financial performance at page 4. We did have yet another terrific quarter. As Mike covered, we've had rate increases that have contributed a total of $0.12 year-on-year at nearly every jurisdiction, load growth has been up in every jurisdiction save for Texas, where we are a wires only business. Generation performance year-on-year is terrific, an additional 4300 gigawatt-hours were dispatch form the fleet of which 2500 went into the wholesale market where we saw higher prices in both the peak and off peak in the range of $10 to $15 higher across the period, so better volumes, better prices, better revenue.\nAs you will see, our operation and maintenance expense appears to be down considerably. We are continuing with disciplined cost control, but I should point out that last year we had a number of tie in outages, which contributed to out lower generation and higher O&M and we also had first of our two PSO ice storms. This year the O&M expense is lower by the amount of the benefit the rate relief that Mike covered in the first quarter approximately $80 million, so year-over-year on a normal basis we are up about 3%.\nDepreciation and amortization despite the additions to plant is down because of amortization that's slightly lower in the of regulatory assets in Ohio as planed, as well as depreciation reductions associated with rate cases that were pushed through last year.\nFinally, taxes are flat year-on-year, MEMCO is struggling against tough river conditions which we are seeing turn around and we expect a very solid second half of the year and the bottom line is it was a terrific first quarter.\nTurning to cash flow; again right in line with expectations, strong net income. I would point out for you that we did see some pretty big swings that tended offset one another between our changes in components of working capital and other assets and liabilities. On the working capital side we do have lower payables this year, associated in major part to those construction programs and the ice storm that occurred in the first quarter last year.\nFor the other assets and liabilities, that's the line where we reflect all of our regulatory deferrals as well as differed fuel. As you know we have active fuel clauses in all of our jurisdictions with the exception of Ohio and we will have a fuel clause in Ohio under the new law, beginning in January next year. So we should see a pretty solid balance on this line in an era of rising prices.\nUnder investing activities, proceeds on sale of assets are slightly lower due to last year the sale of Oklaunion, the Texas Central interest in Oklaunion as well as Centrica. This year we sold a few moth ball gas plants in Texas.\nAnd finally other investing net is up considerably due to the procurement of nuclear fuel at our Cook plant. The bottom line is our cash balance for the quarter this year ended at $155 million in line with expectations.\nAnd finally on capitalization, our adjusted debt to cap is 57.7% at the end of the quarter, once again in line with our target of remaining below 60%.\nMike we can turn it back to you for questions.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks a lot. Kathy, I guess we are ready to go to the Q&A phase.\nQuestion And Answer\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from the line of Ashar Khan with SAC Capital. Please go ahead.\nAshar Khan - SAC Capital\nHi, good morning and congrats on a great quarter.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks Ashar.\nAshar Khan - SAC Capital\nMike, I just wanted to kind of agree with you on the that you might be allowed a high teen number. My only concern was coming is if I read Columbus Southern's financials, they're earnings a pretty healthy ROE and how do we go about providing space towards that subsidiary in terms of growth going forward?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, its clear that among the AEP Ohio family of companies there difference between the earnings at Ohio and Columbus Southern and that's something that we will take a long hard look at as we go forward and make our filing. It makes more sense in the long term to combine those two companies as we go and we are not exactly sure how we will go about attacking that issue, Ashar. But the real benefit from Columbus Southern of course is the revenues that it receives from the pool being a net seller in a long position and the impact of that is that Ohio Power being a net buyer of the short position, if you balance those two out, you'd find a lot of room inside of AEP Ohio to be treated under the ESP and that may well be one of the things that we make in our filing.\nAshar Khan - SAC Capital\nOkay. Thank you very, very much.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYou are welcome. Kathy?\nOperator\nYes, we will go next Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates\nGood morning guys.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning Paul.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates\nJust wanted to first of all, when you talk about the high teens, you are talking about an ROE. Is that pretty much via the return on equity that you --?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYes.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates\nOkay. And then secondly, I guess the excessive earnings test would apply to either the MRO or the ESP, is that correct?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, there is an excessive earnings clause in all three of the sections whether you do an ESP that's 3 year or less or whether you do an ESP that's 3 years or more and there is also language in the MRO.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates\nSo, even if you go to market or get to market, there is still I guess some restriction in terms of being able to make considerably more then let's say in the high teens.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nI think that that's at least to accurate, but we just wont know until we go ahead and see how the filings are put together, as you know if you are going to do a 3 year or longer horizon you are going to forecast in that period what the earnings will be and the commission will determine, we think upfront, as to whether or not that is or isn't excessive and then they will review it after each year to see if in fact that had happened.\nAs you know prices can move around, the earnings that you thought you are going to make maybe more constructive or they maybe less than you had thought that they were going to be. It is in an intriguing issue, but it has been written and there was much give and take, conversations with the speaker, conversations with the President of the senate, conversations with the governor and his staff on these issues and I think that everybody tried to find a balance that would allow for a fair and balanced review both before and after the fact.\nBut remember what again the comparables are Corporate America including utilities. So that's why we think that the comparators are really going to put you in a pretty comfortable range.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates\nRight, with significant risk profiles I guess. And then just in general it sounds like you guys what would be the benefit of going to an MRO versus an ESP, it sounds like from a financial perspective you would be indifferent.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nWell and that's part of what we are looking it right now. The MRO at the end of the day we leave you after that 10 years cycle if your stations at market rates, ESP might well leave you at the end of a three year or four year filed period with yet another filing to be named to be made, and other process to go through. The law allows their flexibility in the MRO for adjusting the amount of your fleet that actually is at market or your low that is at market your low that is at market. However, it does not call for them to truncate and at the end of that 10 year cycle you clearly will have your generation fleet in that standing. So again, as I said at the outset as we evaluate these, it's highly likely that you'll see us file them both, your duty bound to file an ESP that we may also join them with an MRO.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates\nBut financially, it may not make that big a difference either way.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThat's true. That's very true.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates\nThank you very much.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYou bet.\nOperator\nOur next question is from John Kiani with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please.\nJohn Kiani - Deutsche Bank\nGood morning Mike.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning John.\nJohn Kiani - Deutsche Bank\nIn your response to one of the earlier questions, you talked about the potential for eventually collapsing or combining Columbus Southern and Ohio Power, and obviously one is net long, and one is slightly short, from an off-system sales perspective. Regardless of if those two are combined or not, do you believe that off-system sales will be included in any type of earning's test?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThere is a potential for that, there is a part of the law that speaks in terms of evaluating other benefits, and it doesn't describe what those are. It says that you should take a look at credits that may have been monetized, you should take a look at tax changes that may be realized and other benefits, and it doesn't really say if that's on the adjustment side.\nHowever, one of the things that all of us may be losing side of and that's my fault for having not mentioned it, if there is some fear that your going to find the excess earnings really has a lot to do with the rate spikes in the marketplace itself, and if you combine that with a regulatory deferral which the law calls for and offer a securitization for that, you might find a way to tamper some of the impact that that would have.\nSo again, I think there are enough levers inside the legislation for all of us to find a balance between not only seeing to it that our shareholders are respected but that are customers in the market place in Ohio receives fair and balanced rates going forward, and as you know, that has always been one of the goals of American Electric Power,\nJohn Kiani - Deutsche Bank\nThat's helpful Mike. And then, as far as maybe this question is better for Holly, as for as off-system sales are concerned Holly, back when you all originally gave your new 2009 and also 2010 earnings guidance, can you talk about what level of power prices or perhaps what gas prices your were assuming in the off-systems sales portion, obviously gas prices are substantially higher in the out years relative to when you originally gave that guidance, heat rates have collapsed to some extent but it looks like power prices are net and net, still meaningfully higher than when you originally gave that guidance. Can you talk little bit about what was embedded in your original guidance and what you see in that outlook today?\nHolly Koeppel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nCertainly for the balance of year I think we are right on track. The point you made, which is heat rates have come in, mitigates the fact that gas has gone through the roof and coal prices are higher. So our realizations, our margins, that we were seeing are inline with what we were forecasting and I think we are on the track for the balance of the year.\nJohn Kiani - Deutsche Bank\nOkay, that's helpful. Then what about in 09 and 10, relative to what you originally views from a forecasting perspective, would you say that's directionally better, worse or the same?\nHolly Koeppel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNeutral to possibly slightly better, if you think, that these this pricing environment can persist, but I think we are seeing some pretty lofty prices and that would be a bit hasty to adjust anything at this time.\nJohn Kiani - Deutsche Bank\nOkay, thanks Holly.\nHolly Koeppel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nOkay.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks John.\nJulie Sherwood - Director, Investor Relations\nKathy, are there any more questions?\nOperator\nYes, we have Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell - Jefferies & Co\nHi Mike, I am wondering if you have been seeing off peak, maybe I guess higher coal prices being passed through in the off peak pricing in Ohio. We keep hearing of the higher commodity cost, does that hit the off peak pricing in the state of Ohio?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nIt surely has, we are seeing a pretty respectful clearing of fuel prices, both on and off peak.\nAnthony Crowdell - Jefferies & Co\nThank you.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks Anthony.\nOperator\nThank you. And next we will go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs\nCongrats on a great quarter and a good start for the year.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks a lot, Michael.\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs\nI have a couple of questions. First, on the excessive earnings test. Can you talk a little bit about how that process would work, from just kind of regulatory proceeding, meaning it does it look like a rate case, or does it look like something entirely different, that's first question. And second question, totally unrelated to Ohio. On Turk, where do you stand with the Louisiana PSC in terms of getting Turk approval, what's left in Louisiana for that, and what's the what's kind of the remaining hearing or proceedings related to Arkansas air permit?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nLet me try to take those away, I don't think that the excess earnings test will look anything like a rate case. It will be specifically to the issue of their of the comparators that you use going in to where you are today. The burden of proof, of course in every utility proceeding as you know is on the utility. And it is the motion of the commission. So it isn't as though, anybody can file a paper and say we think there have been excess earnings here. The commission would have to make that conclusion themselves and begin the proceeding that you go under. So procedurally, they will have to write the rules on how they go about doing that, which of course will take some time and we'll all have an opportunity to, at least, weigh in as best we can as well others. But I don't think it will look like a classic rate case, it will have a very unique evaluation and the argument will be, did use reasonable comparators, are interstate natural gas pipeline companies master limited partnership companies who have risk profiles not unlike ours, did they include are they included in that. Do independent transmission companies regulated by the FERC, are they reasonable comparator? Is General Electric with a capital adjustment or the insurance industry with a capital adjustment, are those fair comparators. We feel very accomplished... if you just look at S&P, the overall rate return on equity is 20 plus percent. So that's why you are hearing and say things about high teens, so we just feel comfortable that the cadre that the law allows you to be compared to. So I don't think it will look a lot like a rate case in that sense, but burden of proof is on us and that's to be expected.\nAfter the Truck Plant, we are approved in Louisiana by the full commission. We are approved in Arkansas, as you know. We are in Texas with the staff recommendation in the negative, simply because the staff did not want to include the long term wholesale contracts that's SWEPCO Texas has been serving for decades. Which we think is somewhat short sighted, and the commission has asked for some additional information which has now been submitted to them. And we will have couple of hearings, one late April, one early May and the commission itself will opine of that.\nAs to the air permit, from the Arkansas DEQ, we have complied 100% with the legal requirements of the DEQ's authority and responsibilities. They are going through some additional review of data that comes out of some of the Clean Air Act requirements, and some of the associated impact on near by wildlife areas and national forests and those kind of things, but we feel very comfortable that we are in very reasonable shape, there is just going through a standard paper trail hearing process now, and as I said, we expect because we are well within the confines and in full compliance with the law, we expect to receive that premium a little later in the year.\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs\nGreat. Thank you. One last item, at what point you would you likely be in a position to incorporate any Ohio related rate increases related to this legislation into your long term guidance?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nWell unfortunately Michael, because we I don't expect that we'll get much clarity on what we're going to file until very late in the year. And as soon as the order were to come forward and we can see the affect that that will have on Ohio going forward, then will be come out with our three year forecast of the way we see that unfolding.\nSo it's going to be a little different for us because we feel very comfortable, and I know how much you all appreciate the notion of us stepping out with 3 year forecast in October. That is probably not going to happen this particular cycle because we won't, I don't think have clarity by October of the way the commission will handle our report, our filings, as you know, there is a 150 day window for them to look at the ESP piece. There is a 90 day window for them to determine that your MRO approach, at least is an expectable approach.\nSo even if you would jointly review those and they will, you are still going to bump into a calendar problem. But as soon as we have some clarity on what Ohio looks like, because if we do, the ESP route to Paul's question earlier, it clearly will be 3 years as minimum. The MRO will have that same factor in it, actually with the longer time line on it. So the minute we get clarity on that we will give you the forecast of the '09, 2010, 2011.\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs\nRight, thank you and congrats.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks a lot Michael.\nOperator\nWe now have a question from Shalini Mahajan with UBS. Go ahead please.\nShalini Mahajan - UBS\nThank you. Mike, carbon remains a bit unknown, and hopefully we should get some quantity by 09 or 10. As you look at the ESP or the MRO option in Ohio, how do you handicap that? And to clarify, if you do choose a 3 year ESP option to begin with, do you still have the option to pursue an MRO at the end of 3 years?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, you are raising a really intriguing question, and as part of the process that I said that we are looking at both of these options and trying to understand them. On the ESP side of things, carbon would become a regulated capital investment on the existing fleet, as you know there are provisions in the law for new plants to be held in a different category which would really look a lot like a traditional regulatory compact power plant. So that's something that we will look at and that would be part of the determinant as to which of the two approaches we took.\nYou are always free at the end of your ESP period to shift to an MRO if that is your intent. However, once you select an MRO approach, you are no longer allowed to come back to an ESP undertaking. And understand that that's under the current law. And I say that, only to say that S.B. 3 was the law and now we have Substitute Bill 221 and if the state of Ohio finds itself at the end of a 3 or 4 years cycles in a very, very short power position, it surely isn't beyond the realm of what's logical that somebody might pass yet another piece of legislation to rectify that situation and you are seeing that, as you know in jurisdictions all around the country and lets face it, Virginia is a very different regulatory model than it was just two years ago. California is a distant regulatory model from what it was about a decade ago, when they started down the path logically changing the rules out there.\nSo I am not trying to create uncertainty, I am only simply saying if we find ourselves in a very awkward position in Ohio, you can rest assure that somebody will want to take a revisit of Substitute Bill 221.\nShalini Mahajan - UBS\nThat's pretty helpful Mike. And Holly, I think you probably address that in one of the Q&A's but I am still not very clear why the realization of on off-system sales is down year-over-year, given that your are seeing such a strong commodity environment this year.\nHolly Koeppel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, as we've talked in the past, that realization includes not only prices we are seeing in the market but also the net trading profits that are flowing through earnings in the current quarter. And so the revenue number reflects the total book of business, the volume number reflects the output from the plant and it's simply an exercise in division for us. And it isn't really indicative of market prices per say its really net income divided by output.\nShalini Mahajan - UBS\nOkay. Okay, great. That's very helpful, thanks Holly.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYou welcome.\nShalini Mahajan - UBS\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Go ahead please.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Paul.\nPaul Ridzon - KeyBanc\nGood morning, how are you?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nI am fine, thanks\nPaul Ridzon - KeyBanc\nIn a very high price commodity environment, if a few years down the road, things got through draconian, what optionality do you have with regards to the ability to a corporate separation of your generation? Is that door closed or how could that work?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nNo, the Ohio law provides for a separation of the generation fleet, if that's the approach you would like to take, you need to get the state of Ohio approval to do that. And that has been the history in Ohio forever, but for the period that Senate Bill 3 were in fact enforced.\nPaul Ridzon - KeyBanc\nBut it's an option but it would be tough to do because you'd need proof of approval?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nI don't think it will be tough to do. Obviously, you created this scenario of a draconian environment of one store to another, so it will it would well be a hearing in front of the commission like any other hearing in front of the commission. And if you had every legal right to do it and they in some unjust, unreasonable way withheld the authority to do that, as you know in Ohio you would appeal that to the supreme court and if they were beyond their authority or what they had done was not supported by fact, then you'd have a victory anyway, so I don't think its any more... its no different than it has been historically as I said, but for the period that S.B. 3 were in effect.\nPaul Ridzon - KeyBanc\nAnd just as a follow up to the last question. Holly, is there some way we can look at gross margin ex-trading impact year-over-year?\nHolly Koeppel - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThe information that would allow you to back into a proxy for that is in the 10-Q. But its not really disclosed in any detail, you know another point to make on that is, this year in the high priced environment, particularly high off peak prices, some of our units that are on the margin, as you know the most expensive units are what shows up in off-system sales, the least expensive gets dedicated or is delivered to our regulated operating companies, those swing units, lot of the sub-critical units ran quite a bit harder and that's what contributed to the additional 2500 gigawatt hours of energy put into the market. So our lower margin units running high are also contributed to the lower realizations.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd that's why as Holly said to the answer of the question as Shalini had asked, it isn't just a calculation of cash, we're seeing PGM prices of $100, a megawatt hour and your producing it at 40 devices [ph] since you dealt [ph] 60, it is the calculation of all of those activities as Holly just pointed out.\nPaul Ridzon - KeyBanc\nThank you.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYou bet.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Elizabeth Parrella with Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please.\nElizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch & Co.\nThank you. Mike, following up on part of your answer to another question. Can you just elaborate a little on how the law treats new generation? Is there a requirement that there be some type of competitive bid situation or the utilities can propose it as long as it is approved by the commission, and how then it's treated going forward in terms of recovering that investment, and does mentioned that one last question on this topic, does any of affect how you think the commission considers to remount from the supreme court on IGCC?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nWell Elizabeth, as you frequently do, that's a loaded question. So let me try to address it. The law provides for an application for capital investment in new facilities either retrofit environmental facilities or new generating stations. It allows for construction work in progress, it allows for an ultimate non bypassable recovery of the capital for the life of the station. Once it's approved by the commission, they need to determine the need. Once they get to that point you are allowed to go forward and build the station and again the cost recovery is as I suggested non by passable, however they also as they do that, we will have a classic hearing on it as well. So we think that it covers those issues comfortably. It needs to be it doesn't need to be competitively bid, so it's our choice to file what it is that we would like to build, but you have to have competitively bid the construction of the facility which of course we would do, and at the end of the day, it then goes as I suggested and I guess in all that answer I've already lost the second train of thought you were after.\nElizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch & Co.\nOh, the IGCC remand?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I am sorry. I must be getting too old, the IGCC remand intriguingly it might well be affected by this but that is up to the commission. What the Ohio Supreme Court said, and a lot of people missed this, is that we are not sure that Polar [ph] authority wouldn't accommodate this. We're just not comfortable that you gave us enough of the logic that you put behind this.\nSo, the question for the PUCO is to evaluate the new law and may be touch on some of those stones as they send this back to us by way of order which somebody clearly would probably contest, and then we'd go in front of the supreme court again. As we have said all along, the integrated gas combined cycle technology is essential for this country, quite honestly for the world and we think we are best suited to move on of these projects forward and very much would like do that. The timelines are just horrendous when you think about how long it is from start to finish on any of these breakthrough technology that you didn't ask but when you read the Virginia Corporation Commission order it's clear that they were quite complimentary at the end of our effort, but we're fearful of no one having built an integrated station at 630 megawatts and again the same question back on the un-know ability today of what the carbon regime will be let alone the cost of the carbon regime.\nElizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch & Co.\nOkay, thank you.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah you bet. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you, our next question is from John Ollie [ph], with the VLP [ph], please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst\nGood morning.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning John [ph].\nUnidentified Analyst\nGreat quarter guys.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks.\nUnidentified Analyst\nQuick question, I guess a lot of this is yet to be determined and it will be up for debate I am sure. But the ROE that the EPUC will test is definitely a GAAP ROE? It's not a regulated ROE, correct?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nI to tell you the truth, I am not really certain how they'll go about doing that.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, and then, I know this isn't your utilities problem, but if the utility was say north of 20, would the commission have to basically force them to spend to kind of bring that down or how do you think that would get dealt up with, or are you talking about kind of a mid to high teens being fine?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, sure, if you over the years, as I know most of you on the phone know of boringly. So, I have been at this game a long while, you can control your returns on equity by additional capital spends, to the extend that you were fearful, there are two or three ways you can handle that as I have mentioned before, you could defer, you could securitize, you can control the amounts you spend, you can control the thickness of your equity, there is a number of different levers that one would look at as you go forward and forecast what you think the returns would be. So, it is an essential part of the law that was sought by the executive office of the state, it has been written in a broad term, so that all of us who might be affected by it sells it so it had balance to it and it gave everybody a reasonable chance of being successful in a review of the commission believing that you had excess returns on equity capital.\nUnidentified Analyst\nRight, and just the other question, is kind of the same bent. If you don't ask for an increase or another utility didn't for an increase, they just wanted to continue their RSP, will they still be subject to the same rules and tests?\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nOf course you would.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, I was just a little vague on how that was --.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nBecause, remember, even if your plan is just to continue your RSP, you at least have to file that as your electric security plan and that then gets you into the tests.\nUnidentified Analyst\nThat's when the capital --.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd you might I think, not that I need to do anyone's bidding for them, but I think Daten because their current RSP runs through 2010, so long as they don't make any adjustments to it they are not subject to that review for calendar year 09, calendar year 2010. Should they add a filing to additionally extend their current plan then it would fall under the ESP, as I read the law.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, great. Thank you guys.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYou bet.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we do have a follow-up from the line of Michael Lapides. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs\nHi, one question, related to fuel cost, can you kind of frame for us how big of an impact the fuel clause component of the legislation in Ohio would have, I mean, which year do we use as kind of the starting base year for fuel cost that will be kind of tested upon.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nWell Michael that's again a very open question. The last time that we had a viable fuel clause in operation and approval by the commission was 2002.\nOne could argue that would make a reasonable point of beginning I guess may be even then that, as early as the year 2000. But we will try to find an appropriate period of time to begin a fuel clause and make the adjustments going forward. Again using whatever tools are in the law to soften the blow of that, if that need be. So I think that's pretty much an open field to bring in to either an MRO blended filing because of the 90% that will be under the blended definition of an MRO or of course the ESP where you would file the fuel as well. So I think that's a relatively wide open area, there will be discussions and there will be debate about what's the appropriate place. But at least if you just take base of the last time you had a commission approved rate you would begin in that 2000, 2002 range.\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs\nOkay, thank you.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYou bet, thanks Michael.\nOperator\nThank you. And speakers we have no further questions. Please go ahead with any closing remark.\nMichael G. Morris - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks Kathy, and thanks for all of you being with us this morning I know that the law is fresh and you are all reading it. A lot of the materials that have been put out by the various organizations are very accurate, all well worth reading. I think the legislature has given all of us an opportunity to find a place that satisfies our shareholders' need as well as well our customers' desires. Thanks for being with us and we look forward to seeing you all on the highway.\nOperator\nThank you, and ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11 am today through midnight, Thursday, May 1st.

Baird & Company, Inc.\nBill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities\nGeorge Mihalos - Cowen and Company\nOperator\nGood day and welcome to the Equifax First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead sir\nJeff Dodge\nThanks and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Jeff Dodge, with Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today at www.equifax.com.\nDuring this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC including the 2015 Form 10-K and our subsequent filings. During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS excludes acquisition related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. Adjusted EBITDA margin in defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our Web site. Also refer to the investor presentations which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our Web site for further details.\nNow, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Rick.\nRick Smith\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks as always for joining us this morning on the call. Our first quarter performance certainly exceeded our expectations and further underscores the strength and the ability of this management team to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed the commitments we make to you our shareholders.\nAnd not only do we have the experienced leadership team, but the entire organizational rhythm is geared to the Management disciplines we\u2019ve created and built together over the last 10 or 11 years. Those disciplines are NPI enterprise growth initiatives, lien, growth playbook, account management etcetera. I could tell you one thing, this team is hungry and competitive to continue the winning streak that they\u2019ve been on now for a number of years.\nOur first quarter results are noteworthy as they\u2019re compared to a very strong performance in the first quarter of 2015. 2016 first quarter was a record quarter which is on top of a record year in 2015. For the quarter, total revenue was $728 million. That was up 12% on a reported basis and up 15% on a local currency basis from the first quarter of 2015.\nOrganic constant currency revenue growth was very strong, up almost 11% over last year. Also in the quarter, foreign exchange created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.2% compared to 34.5% in the first quarter of 2015 and that was in line with our expectations when we guided for the full-year during our fourth quarter. [Indiscernible] and John will talk about that in detail, as will I, should you have any questions.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.23, up 15% from a $1.07 last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range. As always, before John gives you the financial details, I\u2019d like to briefly cover some highlights for the fourth quarter. As I always do, I will talk about the business units, specifically first and then transition into some corporate level highlights. And then John will take the financials.\nStarting obviously with USIS, they delivered solid 4% revenue growth in the quarter, double-digit growth in fraud, automotive, commercial, and mortgage resellers helped to offset slower growth in mortgage solutions, which as you know last year first quarter was really, really strong quarter for us.\nNew product innovation is expected to have significant impact on USIS\u2019s future growth, while some of this has been driven by Cambrian, the initiatives in USIS, like the Company are very, very broad-based.\nOur current estimate sticking with USIS for 2016s class of new products are expected to have three-year revenue. That is double the estimate of our 2015 class. We'll talk more about NPI, at the Company level later on my comments, but it\u2019s off to a very, very good start for USIS.\nAlso the pipeline of new products is much more robust than prior years. Our current pipeline is estimated to deliver significantly more revenue, incremental revenue growth, reflecting both greater market demand and are increasing investments in products.\nCambrian, which you\u2019ve heard now about for a number of quarters. It\u2019s having a very positive impact with our customers. Since launching Cambrian, our mix of projects has shifted significantly towards multi-data sources and deeper insights from many of our customers, traditional decisioning activities.\nData extraction and analysis time have been reduced by well over 50%, what that allows us to do is fail fast and I\u2019ve talked before, it shortens the cycle time to bring new products to market.\nInitial applications have addressed customer needs across diverse verticals, including banking, auto, telecommunications that\u2019s enabling us to leverage our entire customer base with unified technology and skill sets.\nOur work with Fannie Mae on trended data is on track and is expected to go live as we committed to you earlier in the year. It will go live at the end of June 1 to July of this year. IT integration with Fannie Mae, an ongoing platform for trended data is complete and our global operations teams is in the final stages of establishing their support readiness program, again anticipating at the end of June early July launch.\nUSIS is expected to have another strong year in 2016, with growth at the lower end of the long-term range of 5% to 7%, despite our continued expectations for a flat to down mortgage market in 2016. EBITDA margins are expected to be at or above 50% for the year, which is slightly better than what we\u2019re expecting as we enter 2016.\nOn the international, they delivered 30% local currency revenue growth benefiting from broad-based organic growth, which was above the upper end of the long-term growth model which is 8% to 10%. The growth was also obviously contributed from the support of the acquisition of Veda and John will go into a lot of detail on that.\nWithin international, NPI has been and will continue to be an important growth driver for them. Innovation in international is very broad-based. For instance, in the first quarter, over 60% of new product revenue was driven by our customers\u2019 core decisioning activities. The remainder was driven by new solutions for high-value offerings in ID, authentication, data 360, fraud and debt management.\nThe relationship with U.K. government for our Debt Management Services is strong and the initiative is off to a very good start. We\u2019ve five central government agencies operational -- operationalized, including the HMRC, which is, as you recall, the equivalent to our IRS. And this represents most of the debt that has been placed for collections.\nWe\u2019ve placed over $800 million of debt with various agencies who are performing the analytics and the collections effort. Our data is fully integrated into the process of segmenting consumer and business accounts, to determine which agency is best suited to collect that particular segment.\nRevenue in international's four largest verticals, which are financial institutions, telcos, government, and SMEs, grew a very strong 12% in the quarter, which is very broad-based across verticals and countries. The decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management revenue across international grew a very solid 19% in the quarter. These high-value solutions are deepening our relationship, customer relationships and strengthening our competitive position globally.\nMany of you know we\u2019ve delivered very healthy double-digit local currency growth in Latin America for a number of years, and we expect to do so again this year. Although the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso have a negative impact on our reported results in 2016. It appears that Argentina's new government is moving in the right direction to restore credibility in the financial markets.\nIn fact, I just returned from Argentina and spend some time with our customers, government officials, and economists, and the outlook for Argentina in the next two, three, four years is as strong as I\u2019ve seen in my 10.5 years here.\nAcross the region, in Latin America we\u2019ve a very good management team, a very strong market position and our strategy continues to resonate well with our customers. Finally, the integration of Veda is going very well.\nOur primary focus at this point is threefold. One is a thoughtful integration of the backroom processes. Two, deploying products and capabilities from around the Company that will add value to our local customers. And, three, ensuring that all of our customer facing teams in that region continue to service our customers well.\nWe continue to expect International to have a strong 2016. Organic revenue growth should be above the upper-end of their long-term model, again which is 8% to 10%, with EBITDA margins improving sequentially throughout the course of the year as planned.\nOn to Workforce Solutions, they delivered an outstanding 21% revenue growth and over 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the first quarter. Workforce Solutions continues to grow well above the upper-end of our multi-year model of 9% to 11%. That\u2019s really being driven through strong execution of their core strategic growth initiatives which are adding records to the database, new product innovation, pursuing new growth opportunities in different verticals such as automotive, credit card, healthcare and government. The growth continues to be very broad based across many verticals penetrating new customers and offering new products.\nDemand for Affordable Care Act solutions, known as ACA, with solutions for employers continue to be strong and our current outlook for the year is now ahead of the expectations we stated earlier in the year and you may recall those expectations earlier in the year expected very significant growth over 2015. So, that strength is getting even stronger as we move through 2016. We\u2019ve also identified other interesting opportunities to help employers with their ACA compliance. That includes things like the IRS Forms 1094 and 1095 and even beyond that.\nWorkforce Solutions is emerging as a leader in what could be called compliance as a service to help employers solve increasingly complex compliance matters. A suite of services has expanded and we continued to look for new opportunities to align our services with these emerging needs. An example that\u2019s an emerging need is new regulation coming out around overtime pay changes and we\u2019re looking at leveraging our ACA analytic platform to solve those problems as well.\nEWS\u2019s NPI vitality index is expected to be very strong again this year, reaching approximately 13%. Their growth focus this year is on accelerating record growth in the work number database, deepening market penetration in targeted markets, again such as auto, cars, and government, and maximizing opportunities to help employers with their compliance needs. For it also continuing to solve employers\u2019 complex HR compliance challenges.\nWorkforce Solutions should have another outstanding year in 2016 with revenue growth well above their long-term range of 9% to 11%. EBITDA margins should be in the high 40s, just shy of the long-term target we gave to you earlier in the year of 50%.\nOn to Global Consumer Solutions, they also had an exceptional quarter with 16% local currency revenue growth and a 100 basis points margin -- 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Indirect revenue was up over 50% as the team continues to sign large deals with established companies who seek to deepen and broaden their relationships with consumers.\nOur customers and our pipeline is robust across multiple industries, including banking, retail, consumer products and services, as well as our expanding relationship that we established last year with Credit Karma. Mid single-digit revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities was consistent with our expectations and largely driven by higher average revenue per subscriber in the U.S and account acquisition outside the U.S.\nGlobal Consumer Solutions first quarter performance was outstanding and we now expect that they too will comfortably exceed their long-term growth target, comfortably delivering double-digit growth for the year. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to exceed 30%.\nBefore I go on to John, let me just give you a couple of highlights at the corporate level, and then John will give you the financials. Our enterprise growth initiatives are off to a very good start this year. Three of our four transformational initiatives are, one, developing the work number into a global exchange. Two, disrupting innovation by expanding our Cambrian platform throughout our global footprint; and, three, unifying our Global Consumer Solutions business with a single operating platform around the world that we call Renaissance.\nLet me jump into each of those for a second. We\u2019ve already completed the scope and the timeline for creating an income and employment verification exchange in a select group of our larger markets. We\u2019ve the platform, we\u2019ve a strong customer demand, and we\u2019ll be moving forward with this effort throughout 2016 and beyond.\nWe are -- the initial focus for globalizing Cambrian will be in Canada, Argentina, and Australia. Canada will be the first; while other geographies will complete their initial assessment and define their requirements. We will give you an update on other countries as we exit 2016, but that bodes well for growth opportunities in \u201917, \u201918, and beyond.\nOur global IT platform supporting Global Consumer Solutions, again called Renaissance, is expected to go live this year. After deployment in our core markets of the U.S, Canada and U.K., we\u2019ll evaluate other market opportunities, obviously including Australia and Latin America.\nCambrian has substantially enhanced our ability to provide unique, high value insights to our customers and it positions us well for the future. The platform can easily incorporate very contemporary analytic technologies, i.e., machine learning algorithms, analyze all types of unstructured data, and provide customers with dashboards customized to their specific needs.\nIn Fraud, we\u2019ve applied machine learning algorithms to increase prediction by over 20%, by reducing false positives or know your customer, anti-money laundering, we are incorporating unstructured data to reduce false positives by approximately 60%. For one of our large customers, we are providing them with access to over 50 metrics on over 3 billion trade lines from their customers. We have created a dashboard portal that will be updated on a periodic basis. These types of services uniquely enable us to further deepen our customer relationships and position us as the premier source of insights on their consumers.\nAlthough in the early year, our new product pipeline for 2016 looks very promising. We expect year three revenue from our 2016 launches to be up significantly from 2015 product launches in their three-year revenue expectation, which as most of you may recall, 2015 class was up significantly over 2014.\nTwo very solid product classes will fuel growth through 2018. Our lien -- our work with our customers leveraging our operational experience with lien is creating great client stickiness. The activities we are helping our clients with are numerous and include such things as mortgage lending, collections, auto lending, marketing and employee on-boarding. So again, the activities are far beyond their interaction with us just trying to make their processes more efficient.\nWe\u2019ve also extended the program to International now and have either completed or have projects in the pipeline in countries such as the U.K. and Canada. We\u2019ve a number of clients where we\u2019ve repeat engagements, including two where we\u2019ve had five separate engagements at one company since 2014.\nIncreasingly client leaders making Equifax a trusted advisor in times of change. With these relationships we are able to increase utilization of our products and services across the enterprise, identify new customer opportunities, reaffirm the value of our products and services, and support and strengthen long-term relationships.\nOur broad-based performance continues to position us very nicely to exceed the targets we set for ourselves and have committed to our employees, our customers, shareholders and consumers.\nWe\u2019re now ending the second quarter with strong momentum and in many respects have yet to fully realize the benefit of a number of these strategic initiatives that were expected to make meaningful contributions, not only to this year, but again to 2017 and \u201918.\nWith that, let me turn it over to John for the financials.\nJohn Gamble\nThanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I\u2019ll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. As we indicated previously, with the Veda acquisition, we\u2019ll start focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and the Company as a whole.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin has been defined as adjusted net income plus depreciation, net interest expense and taxes. At the segment level, adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted operating income plus depreciation plus net equity and other income.\nGiven the change in our reporting structure, this metric will provide an improved understanding of segment performance as well as assessing their progress against our multi-year progress. The GAAP, non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin.\nAs you will recall, we\u2019ll be excluding Veda transaction expenses and integration expenses incurred through 1Q \u201917, the first year after the Veda acquisition from our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA margin. In 1Q \u201916, total Veda transaction and integration pre-tax expense was about $22 million, virtually all of which was transaction related. $16 million of these pretax expenses are reflected as operating expense.\nOf this $16 million, $12 million are investment banking, legal and accounting advisor transaction fees and impact general corporate expense. The remainder of the operating expense was acquisition related employee compensation expenses at Veda, which is included in the International operating segment.\nNet FX losses related to Veda financing were approximately $6 million in the first quarter and are reflected as other income. As a reminder, we recognized $5 million in FX gains related to Veda financing in 4Q 2015. Looking forward, the remaining Veda transaction expenses will be incurred in 2Q \u201916 and should be relatively smaller, principally final legal and financial advisory fees related to completing required government filings and FX losses of approximately $3 million related to completion of the extinguishment of certain Veda debts.\nVeda integration expenses will increase in 2Q \u201916 as integration activities accelerate. Total Veda transaction and integration pre-tax expenses in 2Q \u201916 are expected to be approximately $7 million, which includes the $3 million in FX losses.\nNow let me turn to the business unit\u2019s financial performance for the first quarter. U.S Information Solutions revenue was $295 million, up 4% when compared to the first quarter of 2015, and consistent with our expectation. Online Information Solutions revenue was $218 million, up 5% when compared to the year-ago period reflecting double-digit growth in commercial information and fraud.\nMortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 1% compared to Q1 2015. Total mortgage related revenue in USIS was up 7% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the Mortgage Banker\u2019s Application Index, which was up 1% in the first quarter. USIS total mortgage revenue growth continues to outpace overall mortgage market growth consistent with their historic performance.\nAlthough the mortgage market was slightly better than we anticipated for the quarter, our full-year outlook for mortgage origination remains the same as last quarter at flat to down slightly.\nOn to Financial Marketing Services in which revenue was $45 million, up 1% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S Information Solutions was a strong 48.7%. As expected, this was down from the very strong 50.8% delivered in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting the very strong mortgage market in 1Q \u201915. In addition, this decline reflects increased legal expenses versus 1Q \u201815.\nLegal expenses incurred in any given period can be choppy and excluding this increased legal expense, the adjusted EBITDA margin for 1Q \u201916 would have been down only slightly versus the record levels of 1Q \u201915.\nWorkforce Solutions revenue was $180 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $99.2 million, up 16%, was driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and pre-employment market segments. This reflects increased penetration with verifiers, as well as continued growth in records to the database.\nEmployer Services revenue of $80.9 million, was up 29% from last year. Our traditional Employer Services businesses of unemployment claims, Watsi, I-9 validations and on-boarding, performed well with combined revenue growth consistent with our long-term expectations in the mid single digits.\nWorkforce Analytics had a very strong quarter, as 1Q \u201916 and 2Q \u201916 represent the first in which employers are providing Form 1095-C to employees as part of their annual tax filings and as required by the ACA. As these forms are principally delivered in the first half of the year, we expect this strong growth in Workforce Analytics to continue into 2Q \u201916. The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.5%, up from 47.3% in 1Q \u201915. This reflects the very strong growth of our higher margin verifier and Workforce Analytics businesses.\nRevenue from our combined USIS and Workforce Solutions businesses, which represent our total U.S B2B business activities, was $475 million, representing organic growth of over 10%. International\u2019s revenue was $158 million, up 17% on a reported basis and 30% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth, which excludes Veda revenue was slightly above our long-term range of 8% to 10%.\nBy region, Europe\u2019s revenue was $61 million, up 10% in U.S dollars and 15% in local currency. Latin America\u2019s revenue was $43 million, down 11% in U.S dollars, but up 15% in local currency.\nAs you probably know, Argentina\u2019s average FX rate in 1Q \u201916 depreciated almost 40% from 1Q \u201915. Argentina, when combined with the impact on the currency in Uruguay, contributed almost 75% of the negative foreign exchange impact on revenue in Latin America.\nAsia-Pacific revenue was $28 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda, as well as revenue from net positive and our TDX debt management operations in Australia. Our current debt management revenue in Australia is very small. As a reminder, the Veda transaction closed on February 24 with Veda being a part of Equifax for about 40% of the quarter.\nCanada revenue was $28 million, down 10% in U.S dollars, but flat in local currency. We saw continuing improvement in Equifax Canada during the second half of 2015, both in terms of revenue growth and, importantly, the pipeline of new products we expect to begin to deliver revenue later in 2016 and 2017. This flat performance in 1Q \u201916 reflects the relative weakness of the Canadian economy we referenced on our last earnings call. We expect improved performance as new products ramp later this year.\nFor the first quarter, International\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3%, and as expected, down slightly from 1Q \u201915. The slight decline reflects the benefit of adding higher margin Veda, as well as improved EBITDA margin performance and debt management, which was offset by a decline in EBITDA margin in Latin America. This decline in Latin America is due to the substantial weakness of local currencies. A portion of our cost is in U.S dollars, which does not benefit from the devaluation of the currency.\nOver the remainder of 2016, in International, we expect to show EBITDA margin growth reflecting revenue growth in our high margin countries coupled with the cost benefits of the regionalization program started last year.\nGlobal Consumer Solutions revenue was $95 million, up 14% on a reported basis and up 16% on a local currency basis. Global Personal Solutions showed growth across all channels, DTC, indirect and direct, and the strong growth in the quarter driven by -- principally by DTC and to a lesser extent our other channels. For the first quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 100 basis points from 1Q \u201915. This reflects strong revenue growth and leverage against GCS support costs.\nIn the first quarter, general corporate expense of $71.6 million was in line with our expectations and down 9% from last year. One-time items impacted both 1Q \u201916 and 1Q \u201915. As I mentioned earlier, Veda integration expenses impacted corporate expense by just over $12 million in 1Q \u201916.\nAs you will remember, in 1Q \u201915 we executed an organizational restructuring which impacted corporate expense by $23 million. Excluding these items, general corporate expense was approximately $59 million in 1Q \u201916, an increase of about $4 million or about 8%.\nFor the second quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million, including the Veda integration expenses. The adjusted EBITDA margin at 34.2% was down from 34.5% in 2015 and consistent with our expectations for the quarter.\nThe reduction reflects the expected declines in USIS and International that we discussed earlier, partially offset by very strong EBITDA margin performance at both Workforce Solutions and Global Consumer Solutions.\nWe expect to see year-over-year growth in EBITDA margins in each of the second through fourth quarters and continue to expect 2016 EBITDA margins to be approximately 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%, which was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted effective tax rate, excluding the tax impact of the Veda transaction integration expenses, was 32.7%. This was consistent with the 33% guidance we had provided. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be slightly below this level, approaching 32%.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be at the high end of our long-term range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This reflects expected spending related to the integration of Veda.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $90 million and consistent with our expectations. Operating cash flow was down from 1Q \u201915 due to working capital movements. We continue to expect strong growth in cash flow year-over-year for 2016.\nTotal debt in the quarter was $3.08 billion, slightly below our expectations. Yesterday we filed a Form 8-K with the required Veda financial information, as well as a new shelf registration statement which will give us the flexibly to take advantage of market windows to refinance a portion of the Veda acquisition debt.\nAs we indicated last quarter, we\u2019ll suspend our share repurchases during 2016 and focus on very strong cash flow and debt reduction and returning our leverage to a level consistent with our target leverage. We\u2019ll, however, continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016 with a goal of delivering 1 to 2 points of additional ongoing revenue growth.\nFinally, you will recall that in our 2016 calendar year guidance, we had indicated that we expect revenue from Veda of $220 million to $230 million, and that we expect a benefit of Veda to adjusted EPS of $0.10 to $0.15 per share.\nIn addition, when we provided our outlook for 1Q \u201916, we did not include any impact from Veda. As we indicated at that time, once we had completed the initial integration of Veda into our financial statements and had progressed in the transition of Veda to U.S GAAP accounting, we\u2019d provide an update to these estimates.\nBased on the completion of this work to date, we are increasing our full-year expectation for EPS accretion to approximately $0.20 per share. Our expectation for revenue in 2016 is now $230 million to $235 million, which reflects improved growth expectations partially offset by a larger negative impact on revenue recognition from the movement to U.S GAAP accounting. Veda\u2019s performance in 1Q \u201916 was consistent on a pro rata basis with these expectations. Acquisition amortization in 2016 from the Veda acquisition is expected to be approximately $65 million.\nNow let me turn it back to Rick.\nRick Smith\nThanks, John. As I give you guidance for the second quarter and for the balance of the year, just to clarify, that does not assume any additional M&A at this juncture. So it\u2019s obviously the full-year of Veda in the numbers plus organic growth.\nAnd as John alluded to in his comments, we\u2019re expecting to do additional tuck-in M&A this year. That\u2019s just not in the guidance I\u2019m about to give you. I wanted to make sure that was clear.\nFor the second quarter, we\u2019re increasing our outlook for both revenues and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue, including Veda, to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%. That\u2019s partially offset by 3% of FX headwind.\nAdjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.34 and $1.36. That\u2019s up 17% to 18% over 2015. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 19% to 21%. With our strong first quarter performance and second quarter -- and outlook for the second quarter, we\u2019re also increasing our full-year outlook for the year.\nWe expect revenue, including the impact of Veda, to be between $3.05 billion and $3.15 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 17% to 20%, again partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is up from the previous guidance of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion and will move us nicely above the high-end of our multi-year financial model of 6% to 8% organic growth.\nAnd we also, as I mentioned earlier, expect potential additional growth through acquisitions as our pipeline is strong, but not included in that outlook. Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.15 and $5.25, which is up 14% to 17% year-on-year.\nExcluding approximately $0.12 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth of 17% to 19%. This too is up from the $4.95 to $5.05 that we guided to during the fourth quarter earnings call a few months ago. We also continue to expect as John had mentioned, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to continue to expand by approximately 75 basis points for all of 2016.\nSo with that, operator, we\u2019d like to open-up to any questions we may have from our audience.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] We will the first question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.\nManav Patnaik\nYes, thank you. Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations on the strong start to the year. I just wanted to first pick on, I think if I heard you right, you made some comments around trying to expand Workforce Solutions to other regions and you already had some increase in leads. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on that and what sort of timeline we should expect for some sort of replication of the data base you have here in those regions?\nRick Smith\nSure, Manav. It\u2019s an important part of our multi-year strategy. We -- as I alluded to in the prepared comments, we\u2019ve the technology platform exchange that will be moving to different parts of the world. We\u2019ve strong customer interest. We\u2019re going to be very focused in the countries which we go. That process is already underway. Places like Australia, Canada, the U.K. and India are ones that we\u2019re moving on right now. Think of it as a multi-year kind of contributor versus something where we all wake up tomorrow and there is a dramatic change. This is going to be a nice contributor to us. It is not contemplated -- when I talk to our investors and [indiscernible] and others about kind of multi-year financial outlook for EWS, that revenue was not contemplated, so this would be on top of that growth, which I have met with a number of customers internationally, as did Dan, when Dan was in the role and now as Rudy. And I can tell you the interest is very, very high and we\u2019ve the unique technology to do -- to satisfy those needs in those parts of the world.\nManav Patnaik\nGot it. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess it seems like you emphasize the guidance, not including any future tuck-ins. Is that -- am I reading that too much into saying that there is probably a pipeline in the near-term we should see and maybe which areas we should expect that in?\nRick Smith\nYes, our pipeline is good. My whole focus to date has been getting Veda integrated properly. The team\u2019s focused on that, bringing products to Australia, New Zealand, and they\u2019re doing that. But at the same time, we\u2019ve a strategy. That strategy has resulted in a pipeline and we\u2019re moving forward on that. So, while it\u2019s not in the guidance, yes, to be very, clear, you should expect that we do a few strategic tuck-ins throughout the balance of the year.\nManav Patnaik\nAgain, and just last one for me, and it sounds like obviously there is a lot of internal momentum going on at Equifax. A lot of -- your peers are doing pretty well as well. Is there any -- I guess, could you provide some color on how we should maybe try and understand the high growth rates in terms of the extra cent coming from just macro tailwinds or industry tailwinds versus the remaining coming from just pure internal innovation?\nRick Smith\nI think, our long-term model is 1 or 2 points of kind of market kind of growth. And as you know, the balance of the growth is we call initiatives, which are internal organic stuff. I\u2019d say the markets around the world are consistent with that model. We are not -- you are seeing some areas of good growth like automotive in the U.S but I\u2019d not say there is anything that\u2019s significantly changing the market dynamics of growth beyond the 1 or 2 points we talk about and have talked about for years. So, it continues to be largely driven by internal initiatives, including NPI, EGI, and others.\nManav Patnaik\nAll right. Thanks a lot, Rick.\nRick Smith\nSure. Thank you.\nOperator\nWe will hear next from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.\nAndre Benjamin\nThanks. Good morning. I just wanted to talk a bit about Workforce Solutions. Clearly the growth there has been probably surprising, leaving your own expectations. Could you maybe help us frame kind of what the TAM would look like there over, say the next five years? And then where you believe you\u2019re the most penetrated today versus just getting started?\nRick Smith\nYes, I continue to talk about EWS as being an unbelievable growth story for us, not just since we bought it nine years ago, but over the next 10 years. And I like to describe it, Andre, as being very early stages of its growth. What I mean by that is, we\u2019ve talked to you and others about our path to 300 million records and we\u2019re well on our way to that. That\u2019s a huge lever for growth. We\u2019ve talked about further penetrating verticals in the United States. And you heard John talk about great growth, broad-based growth in government collections, auto, card, mortgage, with the penetration level there it\u2019s so early, and it was many, many years of growth still to be had there. Third is the analytics. I alluded to that, John has alluded to that. It\u2019s growing dramatically year-on-year. It was a good growth driver last year. That\u2019s got a number of years of growth left in it. And then, we\u2019re now trying to take that platform and take it to other areas I alluded to, overtime pay is an example, IRS, 1094 and 1095. And then, lastly, it\u2019s taking the work number exchange and technology platform we\u2019ve and capabilities globally. So, when you couple that together, there are so many years of growth left in that business. Is it always going to grow with it -- what was it, 21%, John, in the first quarter? But we gave you a very robust multi-year growth, and I clearly expect that business for as long as I can see, to grow within that range that we\u2019re committed to.\nAndre Benjamin\nAnd then on the PSOL business, you mentioned you continued to sign more partnerships there. How do you think about the sequential growth rate for that business as the partnerships that you\u2019ve signed recently scale and you continue to add new ones?\nAnd then, I guess, based on the list of partners that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve that you can continue to add to your list of partners, how do we think about how sustainable it is to keep growing above kind of the longer term rate that you\u2019ve laid out?\nRick Smith\nYes, I gave you the guidance for this year. It\u2019s going to be a very good year for PSOL. They\u2019ve signed up. As you know, we have a Credit Karma relationship from last year. We\u2019ve got another big player that I think has been publicly announced, they announced it last year in LifeLock. But then we\u2019ve all these other great indirect partners that these guys are signing up. So, I\u2019m very bullish for Global Consumer this year. They will be at or nicely above their multi-year model. And again, Dan is doing a great job now of taking that capability and not just looking at U.K., Canada, our two international platforms, but looking at other opportunities in other parts of our globe that we can take that Renaissance platform we earlier referred to, which is a core platform, and bring it to other markets and grow outside the current footprint.\nAndre Benjamin\nThank you.\nRick Smith\nThanks.\nOperator\nBrett Huff from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nBrett Huff\nGood morning, Rick, John, Jeff, and congrats on a nice quarter.\nRick Smith\nThanks, Brett.\nBrett Huff\nOn the USIS, I think you walked through a little bit about why that revenue growth decelerated, but can you just give us more commentary on sort of that core business here in the U.S., both how you\u2019re seeing the macro maybe by vertical or something like that? And then also kind of what your innovations are really focused on there that\u2019s going to maybe reaccelerate that growth in the back half of the year?\nRick Smith\nSure. I\u2019ll jump in and John, if I miss something, please add to it. One, I tried to be very direct in my guidance when we wrapped up 2015, when I talk about USIS knowing that 2015 first quarter and really the first couple of months of the second quarter were very, very, very strong. I mean, the growth rate for mortgage in 2015 over 2014 in USIS in the first quarter was extremely strong double-digit. So we knew there was some headwind there. So, when I guided for USIS, or we guided for USIS, I said it would be at the low end, if not below the low-end of a multi-year range. So it came in exactly where we expected it and it\u2019s largely driven by those comps in mortgage. But it just remains very healthy. It\u2019s got those first two quarters of headwind that it\u2019s going to have to get through.\nThe great thing is we\u2019ve got great balance across the portfolio. Number two is, if you think of NPI, it takes a while to gain momentum. And they started building some momentum late last year, late to mid last year. That momentum is continuing now. So the number of products they have, like the rest of the Company, are broad across many verticals. Obviously, the one we\u2019ve talked about with the investors that will pay big dividends in the second half of the year is the launching of trended data for USIS. And that goes live, as I alluded to in the third quarter of this year.\nSo, automotive continues to be a good market for us in USIS; everything else I described is a stable economic environment. I think John did a great job. When you think of the U.S business, USIS, we separate two entities. We call one EWS; we call the other USIS. You think about many of the activities are going on when you compare ourselves to others in the U.S marketplace. A fair way to look at it, I think, for you guys is to compare either all of EWS in with USIS or you take the Verification Services and Analytics, which is healthcare, and look at it that way. When you look at it that way, as John said, you\u2019re getting double-digit growth. And that\u2019s the way we look at the business. We bring all of our products to bear to our customers and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an analytics for healthcare company, if it\u2019s a work number record or if its fraud, identity, management or credit file. They\u2019re all solving problems for customers in the U.S, and that\u2019s a strong, healthy, double-digit growth.\nJohn Gamble\nWe saw great growth in identity and fraud all last year and again in the first quarter of this year, very good growth in commercial last year, and again in the first quarter of this year. So, as Rick said, very broad-based and not forgetting very high EBITDA margins. Last year\u2019s EBITDA margins were 51%, adjusting for legal, almost at that level this year. So, very, very strong performance.\nRick Smith\nGood point.\nBrett Huff\nGreat. That\u2019s helpful. And just one other question from me. You gave us sort of the $800 million, I think, of debt from the U.K. that you\u2019ve been working through. Can you -- any more insight on sort of the ultimate size of that if you\u2019ve more line of sight to that? And any broad thoughts on economics to you all and how that revenue model might work as it evolves? Thank you.\nRick Smith\nIt\u2019s going well, Brett. So, overall the debt management platform, which, as you guys know by now, was TDX and it was this business we call Inffinix, which we bought in Mexico. So we are combining those capabilities; we are taking up those offerings global. So the growth rate is beyond just the government contract in the U.K. and we are gaining traction around the world. Hopefully we\u2019ll have some nice wins to report later on in the year outside of the traditional footprint. But specific to the government contract, it\u2019s ramping up as expected. And as John alluded to and I have alluded to in the past, as that revenue continues to ramp, the international EBITDA margins will continue to expand nicely. So it\u2019s on track as expected. It will be a nice contributor this year to the topline and profits.\nJohn Gamble\nAnd we just continue to caution people that given it\u2019s our first big contract with the U.K. government like this, that in terms of the level of growth rate, we\u2019re just going to have to tell you what the growth rate is going to look like as it occurs, because this is the first contract of this size we\u2019ve had with the government like this.\nBrett Huff\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nWe will hear next from Otto Garrett from Deutsche Bank.\nOtto Garrett\nHi. Congrats on the great quarter. Just one quick clarification on your guidance for Veda. You increased the guidance for the year there to $230 million, $235 million. That\u2019s for the balance of the year? That doesn\u2019t include your contribution in the first quarter?\nJohn Gamble\nNow that\u2019s for the full-year. $230 million and $235 million is for the full-year.\nOtto Garrett\nOkay, great. And then also just looking at your relationship with Fannie Mae, saw a release earlier in the quarter that you guys expanded your relationship there to provide a monthly credit updates for their Connecticut Avenue risk securities? Can you just give us the size in there, like what the contribution of that might be?\nRick Smith\nSmall.\nOtto Garrett\nSmall, okay. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you.\nRick Smith\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nDavid Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut\nThank you. Good morning, and congrats on the superior performance in the quarter. Just a quick question on the Employer Services business, I\u2019m used to thinking about this business as being countercyclical and typically a slower growth business than the verification business at this point in the cycle? Is this because of the contribution you are now seeing from Workforce Analytics that you are getting this high 20s growth or are there other big drivers that would tend to, let\u2019s say, modulate the countercyclicality of that business?\nRick Smith\nThat\u2019s a good question and there is no doubt about it that the analytics push that we\u2019ve had is fueling great growth there and will continue to fuel great growth for the next couple of years, but it\u2019s also changing mindset. We used to always assume that the employer business was there to feed records into the verification side and it would be countercyclical. So if unemployment claims rise, that business would grow as it did in 2009, 2010. We\u2019ve changed our views there. We\u2019ve been investing over the years fairly heavily in platforms and capabilities. We changed the mindset of the leadership team there to think of it as a growth business. So, what you\u2019re getting is clear growth in analytics, but also growth in the core non-analytics businesses with an employer. Not at the same rate as analytics, but when you put the two together, you get really good growth.\nJohn Gamble\nAnd just specific to the first quarter, as we mentioned, right, excluding analytics, the other businesses grew mid single-digit, which is consistent with our expectation. So, great growth from Workforce Analytics. Please do remember, in general, Employer Services is stronger in the first quarter, because of work opportunity tax credits. The revenue there is skewed toward the front half of the year.\nDavid Togut\nUnderstood. Thank you. Congrats on the strong quarter.\nRick Smith\nThanks, David.\nOperator\nWe will hear next from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.\nGary Bisbee\nIf I could first follow-up on that last one. So, you mentioned the forms related to the Affordable Care Act hitting in the first and second quarter. Is that -- How does the revenue model work for the Workforce Analytics? Is there a separate billing for that so the revenue would then fall off in the second quarter? And should that -- should we think about that as within the year-to-year growth calculation, or is the seasonality of that going to change a lot?\nRick Smith\nLet me jump in. It\u2019s not the analytics that was unusual in the first quarter, it was the tax credits.\nGary Bisbee\nOkay.\nJohn Gamble\nYes, so Workforce Analytics, which is part of Employer, the general seasonality of their revenue will be higher in the first quarter and second quarter and then lower in the back half, specifically because the revenue model -- the revenue is generated based on the level of activity executed. And it\u2019s a deferred revenue model, right. So any revenue that -- any work that\u2019s done upfront prior to delivery of the product had to be put on the balance sheet and amortized over the period in which the product is delivered. So you end up seeing more revenue during the period of delivery, which is the first half of the year and less revenue in the back half. Was that the question you were getting to?\nGary Bisbee\nYes. So, I understand that mechanic historically, is that different now, because I think you referenced \u2026.?\nJohn Gamble\nNo, it\u2019s just bigger. It\u2019s just way bigger, right. So the business is growing dramatically, so that dynamic is just bigger in the overall growth rate of the Employer Services segment.\nGary Bisbee\nGreat, thanks. And then, the bigger question, so you referenced the second straight year of sharply higher expected revenue from the innovation pipeline. Are there a couple of factors that have led to such robust improvement for the last few years and, I guess, what are they? I mean it seems like you\u2019ve had such strength, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just the culmination of years of focus -- focusing on and talking about innovation or technologies changed or more places where you\u2019re selling multiple services. What are the key factors that have driven this? And is it sustainable or is it -- do you think you\u2019ve just hit a spot that\u2019s great, but then will normalize at some point?\nRick Smith\nI think if you think about it, one, it\u2019s the maturation process. We\u2019ve been in NPI in the Company, I think, since 2006, so as you mature it just becomes more effective. Two, we launched, as you recall, NPI 2.0 maybe two years ago. We kind of revamped the enthusiasm, the approach towards NPI. Clearly, that\u2019s paying dividends as you get other -- more businesses into the game in a broader way. We talked that USIS now ramping up. We\u2019ve talked about Canada ramping up in NPI. And lastly, you can\u2019t ignore the fact that the technology platforms we\u2019ve invested in that facilitate the ability to build products faster, like Cambrian, building platforms like TotalView which allow our customers to consume multiple products quicker. So the combination of maturation NPI 2.0 plus the technology platforms like Cambrian and TotalView that we\u2019ve invested in, are all facilitating unbelievable strength in innovation around the world.\nGary Bisbee\nAnd just one last one, how much of that also is the vertical expansion? Is that technology and what you just described more important or do you say today versus two years ago having a lot more progress?\nRick Smith\nYes it\u2019s great -- that\u2019s a great question, Gary. I\u2019d say, that\u2019s a really good question. What you end up doing when you verticalize the Company as we\u2019ve done in the last five or six years is you now have domain expertise in the vertical, so you\u2019re building specific products with great insight and knowledge to solve the problems in those verticals and we couldn\u2019t do that before. So, there is no doubt that having domain expertise in verticals facilitates greater knowledge and has faster or more NPI.\nGary Bisbee\nGreat. Thank you.\nRick Smith\nSure.\nOperator\nTim McHugh from William Blair & Company. Your line is open.\nTim McHugh\nMost of my questions have been asked, but just quickly, I guess, the ACA related revenue after this first year push, how optimistic are you about being able to continue to grow on top of that or is this kind of a one-time step up as you look at it?\nRick Smith\nNo, Tim, it\u2019s not a one-time step up. It\u2019s -- and I tried to give you some text around that in the prepared comments, but it is a great growth this year. We\u2019re going to continue to expand the capabilities. I talked about 1094 and 1095 with the IRS. We talked about bringing the platform to overtime pay compliance; we\u2019ve talked about bringing once we get the work number up and running internationally, bringing the analytics platform we built for ACA in other parts of the world. So, now it\u2019s an integral part of our growth strategy for EWS globally.\nJohn Gamble\nAnd the customer base that we can apply the core ACA capability to is broader than we currently want. So there is more customers just within the core application.\nTim McHugh\nOkay. And are you at this point, with -- I know there was a number of companies that provided ACA solutions for basically rushing to try and get fully implemented with all their clients in time. Were you able to do that or is there still even a backlog of clients you haven\u2019t, I guess, weren\u2019t fully implemented with that will continue to help drive the growth as well?\nRick Smith\nYes, there is no doubt there are other players in the marketplace. We think we\u2019ve a unique value proposition versus many of them, but there is some good competitors. Number two is the pipeline continues to grow. Number three is when the fine start to be levied to these companies later on this year, that can create an awareness and concern that\u2019s going to facilitate even a stronger pipeline as we exit this year and go into 2018.\nTim McHugh\nOkay, thanks.\nRick Smith\nSure.\nOperator\nToni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan\nGood morning. You mentioned that the Veda integration is on track. Just trying to think about how would you expect to see opportunity of building out the products in Australia will take, like basically cross-selling some of your products that you\u2019ve in other regions? I imagine it might be in multi-year endeavors, so just -- how should we think about sort of the incremental growth in the outer years?\nRick Smith\nYes, Toni, we think about the Company as being a very well-run Company, an established Company, a Company that\u2019s respected in the regions in which it play. So we\u2019re buying really good assets that\u2019s got good growth. We\u2019ve already given the Company a multi-year model for that which is at or above all multi-year organic growth model. Two, there will be some M&A opportunities as we get to know that part of the world better which add to the growth. Number three is bringing products like our fraud products, Cambrian, *TotalView, Interconnect and others, Work Number, PSOL, to Australia will help grow. Right now it\u2019s all about making sure we keep this asset focused on customers, get the backroom integrated properly, build a multi-year plan. It\u2019s not going to be a big bang on the transfer of products or knowledge. It will rather be a very thoughtful transfer of those capabilities over many years to continue to grow that business nicely.\nToni Kaplan\nOkay, great. And just a big picture question, on the consumer monitoring space, how do you see that evolving over the coming years?\nRick Smith\nAre you talking about the PSOL, the direct-to-consumer business?\nToni Kaplan\nYes.\nRick Smith\nYes, I think it\u2019s evolving as we expected and communicated in the past that\u2019s there will be a world of free and there will be a world of pay. Those two will coexist together. I think long-term the growth is going to be greater in the free, which means the paid model around the world will be slower growth, but still viable, still profitable, still growing.\nToni Kaplan\nThank you.\nRick Smith\nSure.\nOperator\nWe will move on to Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.\nAndrew Jeffrey\nThanks. Good morning, guys. I appreciate taking the question.\nRick Smith\nHi, Andrew.\nAndrew Jeffrey\nRick, you certainly have a laundry list that\u2019s impressive of new growth initiatives. I wonder if you could just kind of rank order, perhaps -- I know you probably love all of your children equally, but if you could kind of rank order where you think the greatest or most potent levers are to maintain this nice above trend performance you\u2019ve been putting up.\nRick Smith\nThank you for the compliment. If I had to think about it over a multi-year kind of landscape versus a quarter \u2026\nAndrew Jeffrey\nRick Smith\nYes, that would be helpful.\nRick Smith\nEWS, clearly. I mean, my god, that is -- I don't know how else to describe it other than it has many, many, many years of very solid topline, bottom line growth. And we talked about it getting up to 50% EBITDA margins over some time and high growth that is just unbelievable. Number two, the other growth lever I love and Gary asked about it is NPI. And its refreshing that NPI combination with the maturation and the technology bodes very well for the next five years. Number three, EGI. We are really clicking. Andy and his team are on our enterprise growth initiatives, large complicated multi-business in multi-country growth objectives. That\u2019s got a lot of growth left in it. I\u2019m really, over multiple years, very optimistic about taking the Veda platform and growing it. With Work Number going global, I think it\u2019s going to give us -- as I said before, when I bought the Company, it will give us access to other parts of that world with great scale. We already have great scale. We\u2019ve people in that part of the region, so we will do some acquisitions there. Trended data is going to be important to us, not just for Fannie, we\u2019ve been doing a lot of analytics around the KS list; we are getting by different verticals. So, I think that bodes well for us. And then maybe lastly is continuing to look at different geographies around the world we want to expand.\nAndrew Jeffrey\nOkay. And is the Employer information -- pardon me, the Employer information exchange, is that an important potential subset within EWS when you think about that broadly?\nRick Smith\nAbsolutely.\nAndrew Jeffrey\nOkay.\nRick Smith\nAgain, bringing that to other parts of the world is going to be a nice catalyst for multi-year growth.\nAndrew Jeffrey\nOkay. And if I may, on trended data, you\u2019ve got a lot of really nicely differentiated solutions. That\u2019s one area where perhaps some of your competitors are citing pretty good growth. Can you talk about whether your trended data is materially differentiated from the competition?\nRick Smith\nYes, I think so, because our assets are different. If you talk about the ability to trend utility database, who else can do that? If you talk about the ability to trend [indiscernible], who else can do that? If you talk about the ability to trend employment data, who else can do that? If you talk about the ability to trend income data? So, is the solutions we\u2019re providing for Fannie different than what TU is doing today? No, it\u2019s virtually the same. But the future is trending far beyond just Credit File, and that\u2019s where I think we are uniquely positioned.\nAndrew Jeffrey\nTerrific. All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nRick Smith\nSure.\nOperator\nJudah Focal from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJudah Focal\nHi. Thank you for taking my call. A couple of quick bookkeeping questions. How much were the precise revenues from Veda in the first quarter?\nA - John Gamble\nAbout $25 million.\nJudah Focal\nGreat. And how much was the tax credit contribution and how does that compare to last year in the first quarter?\nRick Smith\nAre you -- Watsi, you\u2019re referring to an EWS?\nJudah Focal\nYes, Watsi, exactly.\nRick Smith\nI don\u2019t remember that.\nJohn Gamble\nI don\u2019t have that specific detail. So, Watsi was very strong last year as well.\nRick Smith\nYear-on-year, I don\u2019t believe it was much different.\nJudah Focal\nOkay, fine. So it didn\u2019t necessarily contribute to the growth that much?\nJohn Gamble\nBy far the biggest contributor to Employer Services Growth was ACA WFA.\nRick Smith\nAnd then verification.\nJohn Gamble\nYes.\nJudah Focal\nOkay, perfect. And then, just one final question just on Global Consumer Solutions. Has something -- what would you say beyond adding new partners? What would you say is driving this massive revolution in this space? This was a turnaround going back a year or so ago and we\u2019ve seen now tremendous strength in this. And not just you, but some of your peers as well. So, how would you characterize the change maybe perhaps amongst consumer awareness and willingness to buy some of your solutions? Thank you.\nRick Smith\nYes, sure. Thank you. Good question, Judah. So, one is we are -- we bought a company a number of years ago, TrustedID, and it takes a while to ramp up an indirect business. We\u2019ve done that now nicely. It took a while to get some momentum. Number two is we are partnering with some pretty good partners who are out there spending a lot of money, trying to advertise the product to the consumer. And obviously that builds over time; as they gain traction, we gain traction. So, it\u2019s a combination of multiple factors kind of coming together at one time.\nJohn Gamble\nOn your first question, Work Opportunity tax credit revenue was slightly higher, the growth rate in first quarter \u201916 and first quarter \u201915. It wasn\u2019t a major driver, but it was slightly higher.\nJudah Focal\nOkay, great. Thank you.\nOperator\nUp next we have Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum\nHi, guys. Thank you very much for squeezing me in here. John, can you just walk through again the reason why the international margins were low? How much of the year-over-year difference was due to the currency impact by having your expenses in the U.S with the revenue and other currencies and how much were from some of the other things?\nJohn Gamble\nYes. So, we didn\u2019t give exact numbers, right. But effectively the drivers were -- biggest driver was Latin -- in terms of reduction, was Latin America. So Latin America, because of the really substantial devaluation of currencies, which is much larger than we\u2019ve seen in the last several years. We saw a margin impact there that was planned, it was expected to occur. And that is specifically related to the fact that we do have non-local currency expenses and all local currency revenues, so that the margins just don\u2019t benefit on both the top and bottom line in the same way.\nCanada margins were slightly down as well, because you saw Canada revenue was flat on a local currency basis, expenses were up slightly. So you had Canada marking down slightly, but the big driver was Latin America. And the positive side in terms of international margins that partially offset those declines were obviously the adding of Veda, because they had very good EBITDA margins. And then also, as Rick mentioned during his prepared comments and after, debt management grew and performed better. We took out some costs and we saw some better performance in overall margins in debt management. So, that -- those were the drivers of why you saw basically flat EBITDA margins in International.\nShlomo Rosenbaum\nOkay. And so, the growth you\u2019re expecting in the EBITDA margins through the rest of the year is a -- basically a revenue leverage item? Is that the way we should think of it?\nJohn Gamble\nSo we will get some revenue leverage. We will also obviously get Veda for an entire quarter in the second quarter where we only had them for 40% of a quarter in the first quarter. And as we\u2019ve said, we are expecting to see some leverage in improved revenue performance in Canada as we move through the year. We are expecting to see also continued improved performance in Europe as we move through the year. So, generally speaking, the continued good revenue performance in International if you had for multiple years, we think it\u2019s going to drive some improved performance in EBITDA margin, as well as we are expecting cost performance improvements because of the regionalizations we started last year and we\u2019ve been talking about for the past year.\nRick Smith\nHey, Shlomo, Rick here. Just one other thing. [Indiscernible] back to 5,000 feet on margins, if you think of EBITDA margins. Just two points. One, I think you will agree, our EBITDA margin is starting -- this is for the Company now, at a very high level. But I think we are in the top 25% of the S&P 500 or so for EBITDA margin. Secondly, we\u2019ve committed to approximately 75 basis points on top of what is already very high margin for the year. We reaffirmed we will deliver that this year. All the way we deliver that for the Company is if the individual components, including International, continue to improve and increase. So it\u2019s important we keep that in context.\nShlomo Rosenbaum\nGot it. I\u2019m just trying to understand where it\u2019s coming from. Also are you having success in getting the ACA clients to put the income data into the TALX database? It seems like a huge opportunity to in the longer term?\nRick Smith\nThat\u2019s a great question, Shlomo. The answer is yes. And that success -- I\u2019ll give you some numbers in the past on these calls and that success will be further enhanced very shortly as we build a technology link that makes the transition from ACA into the Work Number database easier for our customers. So, that technology link and capability will go live in July of this year. Said another way, it\u2019s been a more manual, grind-it-out population of the [indiscernible] database from ACA clients. It will be far easier, more seamless for our customers starting in the third quarter.\nJohn Gamble\nShlomo, just to make sure we are clear, since we are using acronyms, I was referring to EBITDA margin and that was the answer I was giving was around EBITDA margin.\nShlomo Rosenbaum\nGot it. Okay. But -- and so the ACA, we should start to see more automated process of porting income data into the TALX database in July? And is that going to become kind of a regular part of your contracting for the ACA stuff to be able to put that into the TALX database as a default?\nRick Smith\nAbsolutely.\nShlomo Rosenbaum\nOkay. Very good. Thank you very much.\nRick Smith\nThank you.\nOperator\nWe will hear next from Jeff Mueller from Baird.\nJeff Meuler\nYes, thank you. So, I guess to continue the analogy from earlier, Rick, it sounds like you\u2019ve a lot of children and you love them all a lot. So you\u2019re sticking to the 6% to 8% longer term for now, operating above it this year, but it sounds like there is a lot of line-of-sight factors into \u201917 and \u201918 that you listed out. How do you think about sticking to 6% to 8% and within that framework, could you operate above it for several years at least?\nRick Smith\nYes, I feel good about it. That\u2019s why we gave it. As we get into -- back into this year, if there is something from a macro perspective or internally that would drive me to reconsider a different range above that, we will do that at that time. But at this juncture, I think if we can consistently, year in, year out, deliver 6% to 8% topline organically, another point or two inorganically, and give you some capital structure leverage, operating leverage, and a nice dividend and give 13% to 15% return to our shareholders, I think that\u2019s a pretty damn good model, year in and year out. And you will find years move up [indiscernible] as we did last year, as we\u2019re on track to do this year, but multi-unit's a pretty doggone good model, I think, and hope you agree.\nJeff Meuler\nI absolutely agree. And then, on the relationships with the Credit Karma and the like, how are you expecting them to impact the market for credit card marketing or financial marketing? And is that an incremental revenue opportunity for you or is that within kind of the existing revenue relationship?\nRick Smith\nI never quite thought of it that way. I think anytime they are out there in the marketplace getting consumers to be interested about their credit and that results in a product that we sell-through Credit Karma or LifeLock or something else a consumer buys, that\u2019s kind of contemplated in today\u2019s model and tomorrow\u2019s model. I don\u2019t think it changes the financial representation of the relationship terribly. But, to be honest, I\u2019ve not given it a lot of thought.\nJeff Meuler\nOkay. And then just finally, do you guys -- are you willing to provide the verifications revenue growth split between mortgage and ex-mortgage?\nRick Smith\nNo, we don\u2019t break out that level of detail. But as John said, I think I may have said too, the verification growth, which I think was 16%, is that right, for the quarter was broad based. And selling verticals, I think John [indiscernible] auto, car, government, mortgage and others. And not only that, it\u2019s so early days of penetrating those markets, so there is many years of growth beyond mortgage. And guidance we gave for EWS assumes a flat to slightly down mortgage market for the full-year. So it\u2019s going to have really good growth with mortgage decline over the balance of the year.\nJohn Gamble\nYes, we indicated mortgage, government, auto, pre-employment, all grew double-digit.\nJeff Meuler\nGreat. Thank you, guys.\nRick Smith\nThank you.\nOperator\nBill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBill Warmington\nGood morning, everyone, and congratulations on the strong quarter. A question for you on one of the other growers there that was growing double digits, which is commercial. And we haven\u2019t really heard much about commercial since it was absorbed into USIS and I wanted to ask what was going on there? Is it specific to what you guys are doing or is it something overall in the market or mix?\nRick Smith\nI would say it\u2019s a strong testament to leadership. And I mean that seriously. When we -- Brian, Tom, Madison, who is a seasoned executive for us and gave them, in addition to many other things, commercial and [indiscernible] in his past life when he ran USIS, those two guys rejuvenated the people, rejuvenated NPI within commercial. Strategically had a much different outreach, SPFE and/or customers and leadership of those two guys and their teams have done a remarkable job of restating -- reinstating a growth mindset into a business.\nBill Warmington\nAnd one more question on the FICO XD score. That\u2019s one where you\u2019re partnering with FICO and LEXIS-NEXIS and combining the utility data from NCTUE and the rental data from LEXIS-NEXIS. If you could talk a little bit about the revenue potential there for you. It sounds like it\u2019s potentially a premium-priced score.\nRick Smith\nYes, Bill, when you think of all the growth levers that your peers have referenced in past commentary, and if I were to list 10 of them, maybe 15 of them, maybe 20 of them, I don\u2019t think that FICO score would make the list. There are so many other great things that we are doing that you and I should focus on and others should focus on. And this is obviously important to us, that particular FICO score with LN data and our data is de minimus when you think of moving the needle for us.\nBill Warmington\nGot it. All right. Thank you very much.\nRick Smith\nSure.\nOperator\nYour final question today will come from George Mihalos from Cowen.\nGeorge Mihalos\nHey, thanks for squeezing me in, guys, and let me add my congrats on a very strong quarter. Rick, wanted to ask you, you spoke, obviously, positively about trended data, but ground zero for that is going to be the mortgage market. Looking beyond that, what are the verticals or the areas that you think could be potential early adopters or really make a big push for the product?\nRick Smith\nThree come to mind, automotive, card, and marketing, are the three that we\u2019re working on right now.\nGeorge Mihalos\nOkay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. The ACA analytics, as we look beyond 2016, given your comments on the strong pipeline, is it sort of safe to say that from an absolute dollar perspective you could have a similar increase in \u201917 versus what you are adding on in \u201916?\nRick Smith\nI don\u2019t know about that. But here is what you should know is -- and no one has said it, , it\u2019s the pipeline is really strong; two is when the fines come out, that pipeline is going to strengthen. Three is we are going to take it to different areas like 1095 -- 1094 and 1095 for IRS. And, four, we are going to take that product to different areas we haven\u2019t even thought about before as we become a compliance center expert.\nGeorge Mihalos\nGreat. Thank you.\nRick Smith\nSure. Thanks, everyone, for your questions. Operator, I think that\u2019s it. Again, we thank everybody for their interest and the time today and with that, operator, we will terminate the call.\nOperator\nAnd that does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We thank you all for your participation.\n\n",

Welcome to the Keurig Dr Pepper's earnings call for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. \nI would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tyson Seely. Mr. Seely, please go ahead.\nTyson Seely\nThank you, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued two press releases, the first announcing that our Board has approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.60 to $0.75 per share on an annualized basis beginning with the second quarter dividend announcement subject to official declaration by our Board of Directors. As part of that announcement, we also indicated that the Board has declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.15 for the first quarter of 2021. The second press release covers our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. Both releases are available on our website at keurigdrpepper.com in the Investors section. \nConsistent with previous quarters, today, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, excluding items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. \nDetails of the excluded items are included in our reconciliation tables, including -- included in our press release and our 10-K, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance. \nHere with me virtually today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our CEO -- CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. \nAnd finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort\nThanks, Tyson, and good morning. Before getting started, I'd like to express my best wishes to everyone that you and your families are well. It's hard to believe that we've all been operating under the pandemic for almost a year. And while vaccines are providing hope for a return to normalcy later this year, the spike in COVID cases in January, followed by extreme weather in February suggest that 2021 will be another unpredictable year. \nAt the start of the pandemic, we put in place our ONE KDP plan, which prioritize keeping our employees safe and healthy, delivering for our customers and consumers and providing for our communities. These priorities have served us well. Additionally, our success in navigating this crisis to date has been aided by using data and technology to leverage the breadth of our portfolio and the unique reach of our distribution network to effectively manage portfolio and channel mix.\nIn 2020, we delivered at or above the high end of the annual guidance we established at the beginning of the year. And the 2021 guidance we are providing today points to our confidence in achieving the 3-year merger commitments communicated in 2018, despite the macro environment becoming significantly more challenging since that time. \nAs you saw from our earlier announcement, we are increasing our dividend rate by 25%, starting in the second quarter of this year. This reflects the line of sight we have to continued strong free cash flow, which enables us to simultaneously increase our return of value to shareholders, reach our deleveraging target by year-end and invest in expanded production capacity, innovation and technology. In fact, our dividend payout ratio, even after the 25% increase announced today, remains below 50% of free cash flow. \nFinally, we're fully committed to deliver both TSR and ESG. In 2020, we achieved nearly all of our aggressive sustainability goals. And in 2021, we have signed up for new and expanded ESG goals, including health and well-being and diversity and inclusion. We will publish specifics for each in our corporate responsibility report in June. \nAll of this underpins our journey from 2 separate companies to a combined new challenger in the beverage industry to a Modern Beverage Company with an exciting future. We look forward to sharing our long-term vision and plans for KDP when we conduct an Investor Day in the second half of this year. \nLet me take a few minutes to step back and provide key highlights of our 2020 performance. We delivered accelerated constant currency net sales growth of 5% in 2020, with strong momentum exiting the year. Driving that revenue growth were exceptionally strong in-market results across the business. \nIn cold beverages, we gained market share in more than 90% of our retail base, including market share growth in excess of 1 full point in CSDs. This was driven by double-digit consumption growth of Dr Pepper and Canada Dry, our largest CSD brands, as well as A&W, 7UP, Sunkist and Squirt. Dr Pepper & Cream Soda became the #1 new flavor in the CSD category in 2020, while Canada Dry Bold also performed exceptionally well. Canada Dry is now the only CSD brand to achieve volume and dollar growth for the past 14 consecutive years. Strength in cold beverages extended well beyond CSDs, with KDP share growth in premium water, ready-to-drink tea, shelf-stable fruit drinks and Mott's apple juice and sauce. \nAs we discussed on previous earnings calls, the pandemic required us to manage mix across channels, beverage segments and even pack types to react to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping and consumption patterns. This is driving growth in multipacks and cans sold in large outlets and e-commerce to offset slowdowns in fountain foodservice, convenience and gas channels and as a result, impulse packs. Our speed in pivoting to these changes was enabled by new uses of data and technology, consistently strong in-market execution, leveraging our highly developed e-commerce capability and a flexible and resilient supply chain team. \nOur coffee business also had a strong year. Consumer purchases of Keurig manufactured K-Cup pods registered double-digit growth, while brewer shipments grew 21%, which reflects a combination of new households entering the system as well as existing households upgrading their brewers. Household expansion of the Keurig system was very strong this year with approximately 3 million new households entering the system. That translates to 10% household growth, nicely above our longer-term pre-pandemic trend of approximately 7% growth per year. \nNot surprisingly, the consumer shift to work-from-home meant at-home consumption of K-Cup pods was strong throughout the year, while the away-from-home channel, which is focused on offices, remained a significant headwind. And while we expect the away-from-home business to improve slowly over the course of 2021, we will begin to lap the 2020 declines in the second quarter of this year.\nIn addition to our strong top line results, our bottom line performance was also strong for the year, with adjusted diluted EPS growing 15% to $1.40, which represents the high end of our 2020 guidance. This was achieved by offsetting significant mix headwinds and operating cost pressures with revenue growth that was above our targets, continued strong productivity and merger synergies and reductions in discretionary spending. \nWe also drove strong free cash flow, which enabled us to reduce our indebtedness and improve our management leverage ratio to 3.6x, while also making significant capital investments, specifically: our new Spartanburg, South Carolina coffee pod facility, which will be the largest LEED-certified manufacturing facility in North America; our Allentown, Pennsylvania cold beverages facility, which was recognized as Plant of the Year by Food Engineering magazine; and our Newbridge, Ireland facility, which represents our second manufacturing location for our important Beverage Concentrates business.\nIn 2020, we also invested in the expansion of our portfolio and DSD network through multiple transactions, including a long-term agreement we announced with the Honickman Companies that provides KDP with sales and distribution for key brands in the metro New York area, national franchise agreement with Polar Beverages and other numerous transactions with smaller but strategic independent bottlers to ensure competitive distribution scale for our brands. Consistent with our focus on improving the effectiveness of our distribution system, we exited some nonstrategic SKUs during the year, enabling us to keep our high-volume brands in stock and creating space for new partnerships and 2021 innovation. \nIn 2020, we also made great progress on our sustainability initiatives. We now responsibly source 100% of our coffee and 85% of our brewers and have improved the livelihoods of over 1 million people in our supply chain. \nWe also completed our multiyear conversion to 100% recyclable K-Cup pods. And during the year, we co-founded 2 industry coalitions focused on enhancing U.S. recycling infrastructure. We launched our first post-consumer recycled, or PCR, packaging in cold beverages, putting us on track to deliver our goal of using 30% PCR in our packaging across the business by 2025. \nThis long list of accomplishments would be impressive in any year, but it is even more so against the backdrop of the challenges and uncertainty we faced in 2020. I'm proud of and grateful for the nearly 27,000 team members across KDP who have proven to be our underlying competitive advantage. \nTurning now to our outlook for 2021. The guidance we're providing today is consistent with the commitments we laid out at the time of the merger announcement and position us to meet our 3-year merger targets. Specifically, for 2021, we expect constant currency net sales in the range of 3% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of 13% to 15%. On a 2-year stack basis, which eliminates any noise from COVID impact, this translates into net sales growth of over 8% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of nearly 29%, both at the midpoint of the ranges. \nOur confidence in 2021 growth is supported by both innovation and renovation, both of which will be backed by increased marketing investment. Ongoing productivity savings and our final year of merger synergies will help offset increased inflation. We expect our management leverage ratio to improve by 3x by year-end, driven primarily by our continued strong free cash flow generation.\nIn 2021, we are rolling out zero-sugar varieties across our CSD portfolio. For most brands, the new zero offerings represent a rebranding of our existing diet SKUs to more clearly articulate the zero-sugar benefit to consumers. For Dr Pepper, the introduction of a zero-sugar variety will be in addition to original Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper. We are also introducing Bai Boost a new platform with caffeine; and Mott's Mighty, a line of juices and sauces fortified with vitamins and fiber. In addition, we will be launching new flavor varieties across many of our brands. \nWe've begun the staged rollout of our new Snapple bottles made with 100% recycled PET and featuring new graphics. Also, we are now producing all CORE hydration bottles with 100% of rPET. \nIn coffee, we have another strong lineup of new brewers planned for this year, including our first connected brewer for the broader consumer market. We'll share additional information on this exciting new brewer and other brewers planned as we get closer to launch.\nIn 2021, we expect continued strength in owned and licensed coffee. Last year, we reversed long-term trends by expanding sales and consumption of our owned and licensed brand portfolio. Within that portfolio, we have been able to improve the sales trajectory for the McCaf\u00e9 brand, in partnership with McDonald's, which became a licensed brand for us in the second half of 2020. \nIn 2021, we will launch Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Brew Over Ice pods, which taps into the growth of cold coffee. The majority of our brewers launched since 2018 also have a Brew Over Ice option. We are expanding our highly successful Original Donut Shop One Step Lattes introduced in 2020 into One Step cappuccinos. Last year, The Original Donut Shop brand registered double-digit consumption growth and market share expansion on the strength of the new One Step offerings and a new marketing platform. \nBefore turning it over to Ozan, I'd like to recognize the entire KDP organization for their tireless efforts in delivering such strong and well-balanced results. Because of their success, we have confidence in our 2021 goals, and we look forward to sharing our longer-term outlook at an Investor Day later this year.\nI'll now hand it over to Ozan to take you through the specifics of our financial results.\nOzan Dokmecioglu\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Continuing, on an adjusted basis, I will briefly review our performance for the fourth quarter, which our press release discusses in significant detail, and then turning to our full year 2020 performance and our 2021 guidance. In the fourth quarter, constant currency net sales increased 6.6%, fueled by higher volume/mix of 6.3% and favorable net price realization of 0.3%, with our Coffee Systems, Packaged Beverages and Latin America Beverages segments, all posting growth. \nAdjusted operating income increased 5.5% in the quarter, driven by strong net sales growth, continued productivity, merger synergies and lower discretionary spending, which includes marketing. These drivers were partially offset by the unfavorable comparison to a $30 million gain in the prior year on the sale-leaseback of 3 manufacturing facilities, higher operating costs in the current year associated with increased consumer demand and inflation in logistics. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew 5.7%. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 11.4% in the fourth quarter, driven by the growth in adjusted operating income and lower interest expense and lower effective tax rate. \nLet me turn now to our full year results for 2020. Constant currency net sales increased 5%, driven by higher volume/mix of 5.6%, partially offset by lower net price realization of 0.6%. Adjusted operating income increased 10.4%, and adjusted operating income margin expanded 150 basis points to 27.5%. This performance was driven by strong revenue growth, continued productivity, merger synergies and lower discretionary expenses. These drivers were partially offset by higher operating costs associated with increased consumer demand for our products, inflation in logistics and certain other COVID-19-related costs. \nOn a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew nearly 11%. For the year, pretax operating costs directly related to COVID-19 totaled $150 million, of which $128 million were recognized as items affecting comparability. These costs consisted of temporary and unusual compensation increases, incentives for frontline employees, incremental health and safety measures across our employee base and enhanced sanitation expenses for our facilities. The remaining $22 million of costs represented inventory write-downs and bad debt expense that were incurred in the first half of 2020 and included in adjusted results. \nAdjusted diluted EPS advanced 15% to $1.40 for the year. This strong performance was fueled by the growth in adjusted operating income, lower interest expense as a result of continued deleveraging and the lower effective tax rate.\nTurning to our segment performance for the year. Coffee Systems constant currency net sales increased 4.8%, driven by higher volume/mix of 7.2%, partially offset by lower net price realization of 2.4%. The volume/mix performance reflected pod volume growth of 6.3%, driven by double-digit at-home consumption, partially offset by the significant decline in the away-from-home coffee businesses. The strong 21% increase in brewer shipments for the year was fueled by continued expansion of households coming into the system and existing households upgrading their brewers, continued brewer innovation, marketing investments to grow household penetration and a very successful holiday season. \nAdjusted operating income for Coffee Systems increased 7.9%, and adjusted operating margin grew 110 basis points to 34.2%. This performance was fueled by the net sales growth, continued productivity and merger synergies and lower discretionary spending. These drivers were partially offset by the unfavorable margin mix related to the very strong brewer shipment growth for the year.\nPackaged Beverages constant currency net sales grew 8.5% for the year, driven by strong volume/mix of 8.2% and higher net pricing of 0.3%. This performance reflected particularly strong growth in our company-owned DSD operations and our warehouse direct business, driven by very strong execution that drove market share expansion across the portfolio, including carbonated soft drinks, premium unflavored water, ready-to-drink tea, shelf-stable juice drinks, apple juice and apple sauce. \nAdjusted operating income for the segment increased 30%, and adjusted operating margin expanded 320 basis points to 19%. This performance reflected the strong net sales growth, continued productivity and merger synergies and lower discretionary expenses, partially offset by higher operating costs to meet strong consumer demand and inflation in logistics. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 31%.\nBeverage Concentrates constant currency net sales declined 6% due to unfavorable volume/mix of 5.8% and lower net pricing of 0.4%. This performance reflected the impact of COVID-19 on the fountain foodservice business, which primarily serves the restaurant and hospitality sector. Adjusted operating income for Beverage Concentrates decreased 2% due to lower net sales, partially offset by lower discretionary expenses, while adjusted operating margin advanced 310 basis points to 70.8%.\nAnd finally, Latin America Beverages constant currency net sales grew 3.8%, reflecting strong net pricing of 5.8%, partially offset by lower volume/mix of 2%, due primarily to the impact of COVID-19 in Mexico. Adjusted operating income increased 32%, driven by continued productivity and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency transaction expense and inflation in logistics. Adjusted operating margin increased 620 basis points to 21.7%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew nearly 43%.\nTurning to synergies. We delivered approximately $200 million in 2020, bringing total merger synergies to approximating $400 million over the past 2 years. Free cash flow in 2020 was again exceptionally strong at approximately $2.2 billion. This translated into an adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio in excess of 110%. We also ended the year with $240 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Our strong free cash flow performance enabled us to reduce outstanding bank debt by more than $950 million and structured payables by $170 million, for a total reduction in financial obligations of $1.1 billion in 2020. \nDue to our reduction in bank debt, growth in adjusted earnings and cash on hand, we improved our management leverage ratio by nearly a full turn to 3.6x in 2020. Since the merger closed in July 2018, we have reduced our management leverage ratio by an impressive 2.4 turns.\nAs Bob discussed earlier, the KDP Board of Directors has approved a 25% increase in our annualized dividend rate from $0.60 per share to $0.75 per share beginning with the second quarter dividend, which is paid in the third quarter and subject to the Board's official declaration. This new rate will drive a 12.5% increase in dividends per share in 2021 and another 11.1% increase in 2022. \nImportantly, despite the sizable increase, our dividend payout ratio remains below 50% of free cash flow. Highly cash-generative nature of our business as well as our strong profit growth is expected to enable us to continue to delever to 3x or below by the end of 2021.\nLet me now move on to our outlook for 2021. We expect 2021 to be another good year for KDP, which, as Bob mentioned, will drive exceptional results on a 2-year stack basis. Before jumping into the full year outlook, let me provide some context for quarter 1. \nAs indicated previously, we exited 2020 with a strong top line momentum, and we expect to benefit from that in the first quarter. On the cost side, you will recall that we will be comping a $42 million gain in the first quarter of 2020 on sale-leaseback transactions and another $20 million gain in the year ago quarter from unwinding interest rate swaps. We believe this context will be useful to you as you build your models for 2021. \nThe specifics of our 2021 outlook include: on a constant currency basis, we expect net sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 4% for the year, which continues to be above our 3-year merger target of 2% to 3%. This strong growth is expected to be driven by higher year-over-year investments in innovation and marketing, the benefit of recent partnerships and ongoing in-market executional strength.\nAdjusted diluted EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 13% to 15%, representing $1.58 to $1.61 per diluted share. Importantly, over the 3-year period ending 2021, this performance will position us to achieve our merger target for average annual growth of 15% to 17%. \nWe again expect merger synergies of approximately $200 million in 2021, delivering on our 3-year target of $600 million. Adjusted interest expense is expected to be in the range of $505 million to $515 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24% for the year. We expect our management leverage ratio to be at or below 3x at the end of 2021.\nWith that, I will hand it back over to the operator for your questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog\nI had a couple of questions on your pod business this morning. First, wondering how we should think about attach rates this year and then into the future. When I look at your brewer household penetration and how much it increased in 2020, but then I compare that to the pod attach rates, they seem to lag a bit. So I'm just trying to understand if there's some type of timing effect we should be aware of. Or should we assume that attach rates will be slightly below historical levels going forward, especially at this higher base of brewers?\nAnd then could you please confirm if your new pod manufacturing facility is already up and running? Or if not, when it will be? And really how we should think about the potential margin lift on your pod business from this new facility?\nRobert Gamgort\nYes. Okay. I'm going to take the first one, and then I'm going to turn it over to Ozan to talk about Spartanburg. Coffee attachment rates have been very steady for years. And in the past, we've talked about the best proxy for household penetration growth is actually pod volume growth because of attachment rate being so stable. \nIn the early part of the shelter-in-place, we saw an increase in attachment rates, as you would expect. Obviously, we got some benefit from that in the early part of this, but we've seen it normalize over time. And our expectations going forward is that it does normalize over time. So we did get a short-term benefit from that, but remember, that was offsetting a significant hit that we were getting to our office coffee business. So all of the guidance that we put out there for 2021 does anticipate a more normalized attachment rate. \nOzan, you want to talk about Spartanburg.\nOzan Dokmecioglu\nAbsolutely, absolutely. We already started our test runs at our Spartanburg facility. And obviously, it's a multiyear ramping up the production facility given the huge size and the volume that will come out. But all we can say at this point in time, we are 100% on track in terms of continuing month-in, month-out ramping up of our facility. And as we do, as you said, we do expect to further lower our cost of production in the pods.\nAs we communicated previously, Spartanburg facility, as we go into the year, especially second half of '21 and beyond, will be one of the base productivity sources to improve our efficiency in our manufacturing facility with regards to the pods. But not only that, we also have several other programs that will continue to help us to deal with the management of our overall per pod cost going forward at the same time. So the things are on track.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane\nJust a couple of quick ones for me. First, maybe if, Ozan, can you give us a little bit more color and insight in terms of just how we're thinking about inflation in total for KDP this year and maybe more specifically in Packaged Beverages, with fuel costs likely to go higher? Maybe packaging -- just specifically in Packaged Beverages, how you're thinking about managing inflation?\nAnd then maybe just one last one. If we've done the math right, it looks like you undershipped -- Beverage Concentrates shipments lagged consumption for the full year in 2020. So as we're kind of thinking about modeling '21, will there be any sort of disconnect the other way? Will concentrate shipments maybe exceed consumption in '21?\nOzan Dokmecioglu\nSo on the inflation point, yes, we expect 2021 to face higher inflationary pressure than 2020. And we have built that into our guidance for the year, obviously. And we are very confident that we can manage the exposure. Primary areas of inflation in 2021, as you also alluded, Bryan, would be in the logistics as well as corn-related products. While other areas, such as coffee, for example, that we contract for yearly, not months, will also serve as a partial offset. \nIt's basically the umbrella of the commodity and the input cost management that we always do. And when the opportunity presents itself, we also hedge ourselves in order to manage our cost profile. Therefore, we believe we have a good balance right now. It is true. We are seeing, as I said, on a couple of line items, cost pressures increasing in '21 versus '20.\nAt the same time, second point is -- the answer for your question with regards to the Beverage Concentrates. It is true, when we look in a closing, like a month or 2, we may see some lagging with regards to the -- our concentrate shipments in Beverage Concentrates as well as the finished product shipments from our bottlers or the distributors. But when we take a medium to a little longer-term perspective, they always catch up, and that's what we are going to see in 2021 as well.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy\nGreat. And congratulations on a strong year, particularly in this environment. Just to stick with the guidance and the outlook for both of you. So guiding to 13% to 15%, which is great, but [indiscernible]. And just to pick through some of the items, the revenue outlook is better, which is encouraging, right, particularly given the inflection of the coffee business. You're getting 1 to 2 points of help from a lower tax rate. Synergy, you're wrapping that up this year. That's a major contributor. The financial pacing with respect to the balance sheet deleverage is in line with expectations. To Bryan's question a moment ago, commodity is more of a pressure point than I'd imagine you expected. \nWhat else is that? Is advertising and marketing moving up? Maybe you could comment on that. What are some of the other pressure points that are driving a below algorithm year, at least for the 3-year target for EPS growth with the top line outlook so strong?\nRobert Gamgort\nYes. I mean a couple of things. I mean when we put our algorithm out there, we didn't say we were going to achieve 15% to 17% every year and the guidance we just put out there puts it nicely within that range, in that 15% to 17% despite what we all agree is a world that is very different than it was in 2018. \nThe one comment I would put is we are restoring marketing in 2021. We've said all along that any opportunity to restore marketing to drive growth, we would do so. In fact, on our Q3 earnings call, I think we were really clear on our intentions. And when we provided our guidance, and we said that we would be in the 13% to 15% range for 2020, we also said any opportunity to over-deliver would be reinvested back in our business for growth, which is exactly what we did. We came in right at the high end of our guidance. We reinvested back into growth, and we achieved 6.6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. \nSo we look at our outlook for 2021 to be incredibly strong and, more importantly, well balanced. Because the results that we've delivered are not driven by anything that would hurt us in the long term by driving the short term. In fact, quite the opposite. We've invested in brand growth and innovation, in new plant capacity. We've invested in technology. And that's why we're able to do things like grow share on 90% of our portfolio and add an extra 1 million households into the Keurig system.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman\nGreat. I was curious -- I guess, two things. One is the dividend increase is sizable and, I think, unexpected, which is great. But I was also curious how that fits into your thoughts about overall capital allocation and the outlook for acquiring brands outright or continuing to make investments in new brands. So that was one question.\nAnd then the second is, you've had tremendous market share gains all year in the cold side of the business, as you've talked about. We've also made all these route-to-market changes. And so I was just curious, kind of at a very high level even, what you're hoping to get out of those changes, right? Is it accelerated growth? Is it better efficiency? Again, because the share performance in the existing footprint, if you will, had already been as strong as it was, particularly in 2020.\nRobert Gamgort\nOn the dividend side, we know that dividends are an important part of shareholder return in this space. And we saw an opportunity to provide more return to our shareholders by increasing the dividend 25%. We do that while simultaneously sticking to our deleveraging target and also investing heavily in the business. And all I would say on that one is it's reflective of the very strong confidence that we have and line of sight to continued strong earnings and strong free cash flow. And even with that substantial increase in dividend rate, our payout ratio is still below 50%, which is well below just about anyone else in this space. \nIt doesn't change our outlook at all on our ability to participate in M&A. We've said all along that, even with our commitment to rapidly delever, we would be able to participate in the M&A space in a number of different ways. With CORE, for example, we used shares to make that acquisition, and that acquisition has been very value-accretive to us in terms of being able to drive growth both on the top line and earnings. We acquired Big Red with cash. We had a very unique transaction with the Honickman Companies to be able to secure our brands in the metro New York area. We've entered into other deals that are more partnership.\nAnd then I'm going to segue into your next question because it's related. If you take a look since 2019, we've done about a dozen transactions in the route-to-market space, and nearly all of those were paid for right out of our cash flow. So it just tells you that we have incredible cash flow visibility that allows us to do all of this activity while delevering, while increasing our dividend payment and also investing in plant infrastructure and technology. So it's just another opportunity to reward our shareholders.\nWith regard to the route-to-market space, you asked what our goal is. It's all of the above. So we look at our business market by market and as we've joked with you sometimes, but it's not far off, ZIP code by ZIP code. Our situation is very different across the market. In aggregate, we control the distribution or we have DSD coverage that covers somewhere slightly north of 75% of the U.S. population. But for those of you that know the business intimately, you know that it's very different brand by brand. \nSo it's a two pronged approach. We invest heavily in our brands through marketing and innovation and renovation. And then we need to make sure that market by market, we have the most competitive distribution system for those brands. And that has led to all of the transactions that I just talked about and the couple that you highlighted. And what does that do for us? It's a long-term play, not a short-term play. It gives us access to both growth through better execution and also gives us access to efficiency through consolidation of inefficient retail distribution.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian\nSo the 28% brewer growth in Q4 was very striking. It even came a few quarters into COVID when, theoretically, a lot of new households had already purchased brewers in response to COVID. So I was just hoping you could be a bit more specific on the key drivers behind the Q4 brewer strength. How sustainable that might be as we look forward into 2021?\nAnd then also, just taking a step back and looking more at the full year. Clearly, the 3 million household penetration increases above that typical 2 million pace. So just how do you think about that incremental 1 million households? Does a lot of that sort of come out in 2021? Or do you think that 2021 household increase could be similar to the historical range pre-COVID-driven 2020, in theory?\nRobert Gamgort\nYes. Those are good -- great questions. Let me start with the last one, which is household penetration and then talk about brewer growth. Because as we said all along, brewer growth is not a great predictor of household penetration. And while there is a correlation between the 2, not necessarily year in and year out. So let me start with household penetration.\nYou're correct that our most recent run rate has been about 2 million net new households per year. That increased to 3 million households. We don't believe that's a pull forward from '21. We don't believe that that's actually material in the grand scheme of things. \nBecause the best way to look at this business is to look at it over a longer period of time. Definitely not quarter-to-quarter, and even year-to-year isn't particularly helpful. And why I say that is, in the past 5 years, so if you take a look at the 5 years since Keurig was taken private and then merged with KDP, that's a good time frame. We've increased households from 21 million to 33 million. That's an increase of about 9% per year. It's a compound growth of 9% per year. It's 12 million new households. And if you recall back in 2015, 2016, the word on -- out there was that household penetration had flattened and the market was saturated, and we've increased our household base by more than 50% since then. \nWith all that growth, if you go back to the Investor Day presentation that we laid out in great detail in 2018, and with the remaining universes of households, there's still another 60 million households that ultimately should be converted from brewing coffee by the pot to brewing it by the cup. And Keurig, obviously, has the lion's share of that. And so we've got years and years of runway ahead of us at the growth rate that we're at.\nSo when you look at 2 million to 3 million year-over-year, it looks material. When you look at going from 21 million to 33 million in 5 years with 60 million households a go, 1 million is a blip in all of that. \nHaving said that, let's be careful on the year-over-year comparisons, which everyone will report on. So if we went back to our normal 2 million household penetration growth, that would look like 6% growth in 2021. I'm not projecting. I'm just keep going through the illustration. And people will write that there's a deceleration in household penetration, which would actually be a real misleading conclusion.\nLet's talk about brewer sales. Brewer sales are a combination of things. They're a combination of new households entering the system, people upgrading their brewers as we introduce new models with benefits and features that didn't exist before. We're seeing more upgrades. And also, we see replacements of brewers that over time fail. So we shipped 11 million brewers last year. That was a record number. \nIn addition to the strong household penetration growth, we saw a record number of upgrades. People were investing in their work-from-home situation. We've got all these great brewers that were just introduced in the past couple of years, and so we saw people lean in and upgrade. And as I always point out, while that doesn't have a material impact in the year, that's yet another household recommitting to the Keurig system for the next 3, 4, 5 years. So it's all incredibly bullish. \nGoing into this year, we wouldn't expect to see that number in 2021. We don't need that -- we don't need 11 million brewers to support a 2 million or even a 3 million household penetration growth. We have no idea how many people are going to upgrade. That's something that we can't predict. \nSo I think as you look at 2021, a flat number on brewer growth would be extraordinary. A decline in brewer growth would be very normal and would support great household penetration growth. But again, watch for the headlines that are going to say how brewer sales are down and it's a concern about the Keurig system in the future.\nMy last -- because it's a good point of time for me to say this. I think my last point is, as we think about '20 to '21, you guys are going to have to do this across the board. Just make sure you take a look at 2-year stack numbers, not just year-to-year numbers. So as I put in my script, when you took -- look at the total KDP basis, a 2-year stack basis, which takes out all that noise, in 2021, if we hit the midpoint of our guidance, we're going to be 8% revenue growth over 2 years and 29% EPS. So I think that's the way we're going to have to look at the world in 2021.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.\nSunil Modi\nI was looking at some of this numerator data, and it's showing how more and more of the pods are being sold online, regardless of the brewers, bought online or in a brick-and-mortar environment. So I was just hoping you can share with us the implications of that from a P&L perspective margin-wise, consumer insight, visibility, right, because it's not as easy to track just from a retail consumption standpoint. So any clarity around that would be helpful.\nRobert Gamgort\nYes. So it's -- that's a great insight. We've been really proud of the development that we have in e-commerce. When we launched the company in 2018, we talked about 1 of the 7 routes to market being e-commerce, and that we believe that we were the most developed food and beverage company in that. 2018, I don't think anyone really cared much about e-commerce and beverage. But today, we all care. And we talked last year about more than 10% of our total company sales going through e-commerce. And obviously, that's an area that's accelerating dramatically.\nOn coffee, in particular, coffee pods, we go -- we get to the consumer through e-commerce 2 ways: We go through retailer.com and amazon.com, but we also go through Keurig.com. I know it's more challenging for you guys to have visibility of that. We've talked about that, on pods, in particular, that an increasing percentage of our pod sales are not visible through traditional syndicated data, but we have a really good handle on what goes on in e-commerce. And to your point before, we also, in many cases, are able track it down to the individual consumer who's buying this. So we have a much more targeted marketing program as a result of all of that.\nAs far as margins and all of that go, it's great. There's not a concern here. It's more challenging, as you can imagine, to ship liquids. I think the future of e-commerce and liquids is much more in the click-and-collect mode or home-delivery mode, not shipping it through traditional FedEx and UPS. But Keurig pods are high value, lightweight, long shelf life, don't damage. It's almost an ideal item to ship through traditional e-commerce channels, and that's why it's been really attractive. So it's going to be an increasing part of growth in our business.\nAnd one of the things we'll talk about in 2021 is the launch of the first consumer -- excuse me, the first connected brewer for broad-scale consumer use. We're excited about that. We'll talk to you about that in the future. And I think that's going to accelerate more of the e-commerce attractiveness for the Keurig business going forward.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira\nSo my question is on the competitive environment. And Bob, you mentioned the investments and also innovation that you're putting for both Packaged Beverages and coffee. So are you seeing the need to increase A&P investments in light of what some of your competitors have announced, particularly in flavors? And the second part of this question, if you can also talk about pricing for Packaged Beverages and the coffee pods in the context of your outlook for 2021?\nRobert Gamgort\nYes. Our reason for restoring marketing is because we have an objective to increase our marketing as a percentage of sales over time. And we know what happened in COVID across the board. We're really proud of the fact that despite the fact that we had to pull some of that marketing -- and some of it, it was just a bad environment to invest in advertising. And they're certainly in the early and mid parts of the year. And other parts of it was because of the great mix headwind that everybody in the industry faced. \nWe were proud of the fact that we did that, but we got really efficient in where and how we spend our marketing. And my best evidence of that is the market share gains across our portfolio that suggest that we were able to still balance brand growth, investments in innovation, with a more restricted marketing budget.\nEvery opportunity that we get, we will invest in marketing and innovation. That's what we're doing in 2021. It's not a reaction to competition at all. It's an investment in the great pipeline of brand ideas that we have. And as you can tell from all of our conversation here, we are building this business for the long haul. \nAs I referenced before, when we looked at the fourth quarter, and we knew that we were trending very strong for 2020, we were very explicit in saying any over-delivery would be reinvested back into brand growth, and that's exactly what we achieved in Q4. So that's our ambition, is to build a very healthy brand portfolio for the long haul.\nWith regard to pricing, I think this industry is incredibly rational in pricing. And we don't discuss what our specific outlook is for pricing in a given year, but we're -- we have our eye on inflation, as does everyone. And I think that the beverage industry has shown that it's been able to recover inflation through a combination of productivity and pricing, and I wouldn't expect that would change going forward.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein\nGreat. And again, congratulations on a terrific year in very challenging circumstances. So as you look out on 2021, I think a lot of the shelf changes were postponed or didn't happen in 2020. What are the shelf sets look like for the spring reset? Do you get a sense that you're gaining shelf space? And maybe give us an update on some of the new brand initiatives: Don't Quit, A Shoc, Polar. So that would be the first question.\nAnd just the second question, just a detail, if you could give us a reminder of your investment in BODYARMOR and if, in fact, that gets sold, what -- how to look at proceeds to KDP?\nRobert Gamgort\nYes, sure. I think -- let me start with the shelf changes. A more normal year in 2021 than 2020 when innovation was more challenging to get on the shelf. We got a good head start with Dr Pepper & Cream and also with Canada Dry Bold. And as you know, we have a long list of innovation and renovation that we launch every year, so I'm not going to mention them all. \nI think 2021 is -- it looks more normal in access to the shelf. We've got a really strong lineup of innovation across the board. We talked about some of it in the prepared remarks, but we -- again, we have much more than that. And so we stand in a really good position to get that strong innovation and renovation on the shelf quickly. \nAnd our speed to market as a company has improved every single year. And it's -- we're very proud of the distribution system that we're building, a combination of our company-owned DSD as well as our independent partners. And through a combination of strength of ideas, better joint planning with our partners and our customers, we've been able to improve our reach to shelf. And so that's going to continue.\nYou mentioned some of the seed investments that we have in brands like Don't Quit and A Shoc. All in early stages, all very promising, too small at this stage for us to report. But I would expect that when we do our Investor Day midyear, we'll give a more comprehensive update on all of the start-up investments. \nAnd that's just one of many tools that we employ, where we've said before that we can launch something on our own. We can partner with somebody in a joint distribution manner as we've done with things -- brands like evian. We can make seed investments as we did with Don't Quit and A Shoc, and we can acquire things outright, as we did with CORE. \nPolar is off to a great start. It's a terrific brand and really our play in the sparkling water, flavored sparkling water segment. We're ramping that up right now. The ACV for Polar has already improved by about 20 ACV points nationally. So it shows the strength of our partnership with them. And obviously, you can tell by the comments here that we're very bullish on driving that brand to a national leader in the not-too-distant future. \nAnd then the last one, BODYARMOR. It's publicly available. We have 12.5% ownership stake in BODYARMOR. If and when that business is sold, then we would receive payment just like any other investor would receive payment at that time. And we don't know anything more than what's been publicly reported to date. So I think I covered all of your territory there.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS.\nSean King\nWhen we think about your three year synergies coming to an end this year, have you identified savings opportunities amidst the pandemic, like some of your large U.S. peers, that can carry the margin expansion story into -- beyond the 3-year guidance?\nRobert Gamgort\nYes, I'm going to turn this over to Ozan for more specifics. Our initial focus is to make sure we deliver those synergies because there were some questions on day 1. Could we really achieve those? And obviously, we have a line of sight to do that. But we also know that, that's a -- synergies are always a short-term situation. And we made sure that we had line of sight to productivity beyond. But also we used it not just to drop to the bottom line, but to invest heavily in our business during this mode. \nBut Ozan, do you want to pick up from there and think -- and talk about how we think about productivity beyond synergies?\nOzan Dokmecioglu\nAbsolutely. So let me step back and look at it. As you said, three years ago, 2.5 years ago, to be precise, we said that we expect to deliver $600 million of deal synergies, starting 2019 through 2021, $200 million every year. And as we just spoke, during our script, we are very happy to share with everyone that, after two years, we have delivered successfully $400 million of synergies, and we expect to deliver another $200 million in 2021. That would complete the 3-year cycle of the merger synergies that we put out there.\nNow we also said and shared publicly that overall efficiencies, we look at it in 2 big buckets: One is the merger synergies that I just spoke. And the second one, as we define and call it, base productivity programs, which obviously, base productivity programs will continue, including 2021 and beyond. \nWhen we step back and look at it holistically, we have several programs and initiatives that actually either we are executing now or we will be starting to execute to continue to fuel the base productivity programs that we have. For example, when you look to what's happening in the Coffee Systems, we are building a state-of-the-art K-Cup facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina. As I said, I think, 10 minutes ago, we are at the early phase of having, let's say, test runs over there. And we expect to ramp up the facility for the remainder of the 2021 and beyond 2022. That will be a good source of base productivity programs for us.\nWhen we look to Packaged Beverages, for example, at this year, we are also building and will be put into service and Allentown, Pennsylvania and again, in a state-of-the-art aseptic systems lines, for example. That will continue to drive down our costs. \nOn the Beverage Concentrates side, for example, we are building the second concentrate plant in Ireland. And besides the continuity of our business will be secured, given we only have one facility now in St. Louis, we'll also have some financial benefits at the same time. And these are, for example, the 3 big programs that we have. But on top of this, we always look for efficiencies, and we have several other programs that we are implementing as we speak. Therefore, we feel very confident that beyond 2021 that our overall efficiency programs will be intact and will help us to drive further profit growth and margin enhancement.\nOperator\nAnd that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Tyson Seely.\nTyson Seely\nThank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I know it's a busy day for many of you. But as usual, the IR team, myself and Steve, are around for any follow-up calls, so please feel free to reach out to us. Stay well, and be safe. Thank you, everyone.\nOzan Dokmecioglu\nThanks.\nOperator\nThank you, presenters, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining Keurig Dr Pepper Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.

At the request of Nordstrom, today's conference call is being recorded. All lines will be placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to introduce Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.\nTrina Schurman - Director, Investor Relations, Nordstrom, Inc.\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and we'll include 30 minutes for your questions. Before we begin, I want to mention that our speakers will be referring to slides, which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations section.\nToday's discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slide showing our Safe Harbor language.\nParticipating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, President; and Mike Koppel, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's fourth quarter and 2014 performance in addition to outlook for fiscal 2015. Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete Nordstrom, President of Merchandising; and Erik Nordstrom, President of Direct.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.\nBlake W. Nordstrom - President & Director\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As we reflect on the year, we consider 2014 to be a watershed moment in our company history with the successful entry into Canada, the expansion of the Rack business through store growth and the launch of nordstromrack.com, the acquisition of Trunk Club and the decision to explore the potential sale of our credit receivables.\nThese milestones are the outcome of our strategy, which is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the Nordstrom experience that they expect from us. Several years ago we began our path to accelerate growth in multiple channels as we evolve with the changing needs of our customers. In 2014 we delivered tangible results in executing our strategy over the last several years. Today we made Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies, ranking number 14 overall and leading in our category.\nWe continued to see the ongoing evolution of retail with the accelerated growth in e-commerce, the continuing importance of stores and the increasing customer interaction between them. Customers increasingly expect a personalized experience that merges the richness of stores with the convenience of online. We're uniquely positioned to serve customers through our focus on service, product and capabilities.\nWe also believe we are competitively advantaged by serving customers better through our multiple touch points in full-price, off-price, stores and online. As a result we have more customers shopping with us and more customers shopping two or more channels. This is meaningful as customers who shop multiple channels spend more and demonstrate greater loyalty.\nIn 2014 we reached an important milestone with the Rack, representing our biggest source of new customers, attracting nearly four million. Additionally, about 1/3 of our Rack customers also shop in our full-price business.\nA year ago, we enabled customers to return purchases from HauteLook and nordstromrack.com to any of Rack stores. This singular capability drove nearly one million incremental trips to our Rack stores. In 2014 we expanded our capabilities to ensure we're relevant today and in the future. Our first store in Calgary far exceeded our expectations, reflecting a multi-year effort from our team to address the unique challenges of crossing a border. In the U.S. we increased our presence with two full-line stores in Jacksonville, Florida and Houston, Texas. They feature our award winning design concepts that incorporate flexibility and light.\nIn the Rack, we reached a record number of 27 store openings which contributed to Rack's total sales growth of 17%. We've expanded our capabilities with the acquisition of HauteLook in 2011, which has grown nearly 150% in three years. HauteLook launched nordstromrack.com in the spring, adding to its strong growth trajectory. We more than doubled selection since the launch, with accelerated sales growth for the combined business in the second half of the year. Finally we strengthened our multi-channel capabilities when we acquired Trunk Club, a high growth business that offers a new approach to personalized service.\nIn 2014 we also added capabilities to enhance the customer experience with an emphasis on convenience. This includes an upgraded point-of-sale system in addition to ongoing enhancements to mobile, the online checkout process and texting tools for our salespeople. We consider our product offering to be a key differentiator in providing customers with the top brands they want. This is enabled through our vendor partnerships and our own product group, where we can provide vendors new channels of distribution that are beneficial for our vendors and the overall customer experience.\nIn our full-price business we tripled our selection on nordstrom.com since 2011. In the Rack, we offer customers great brands at great prices with 48 of the top 50 full-line brands. In addition when brands participate in dual-flash events, on nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, we've seen a lift in brand sales across all four channels. Most recently we announced our partnership with Madewell, starting with an offering in 15 stores and online. Similar to our partnerships with Topshop and Charlotte Tilbury, this is another way to enhance our product offering and create excitement for both new and existing customers.\nAs we look ahead to 2015, we have a number of growth initiatives planned in support of our efforts to improve the customer experience, including our ongoing expansion in Canada with a store opening in Ottawa in the spring and Vancouver in the fall. In the U.S., we plan to expand our retail presence with three new full-line stores in Puerto Rico, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee. We also plan to open 27 Rack stores this year and roughly 25 stores in 2016. Since we announced our growth plans a couple of years ago, we now see a clear path to reach 300 Rack stores by 2020.\nOur supply chain capabilities are another key element in enhancing the customer experience through faster delivery. This fall, we are planning to open a third fulfillment center located in Pennsylvania. Having fulfillment centers closer to the customer will enable us to offer two-day shipping for free to more customers.\nWe will continue to fuel our fastest-growing businesses through deeper integration and capabilities. Trunk Club doubled its sales in 2014, and has planned to double its sales again this year.\nFrom a merchandise perspective, we've enjoyed our partnership with Topshop over the last two years, which has attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Based on the great reception we've heard from customers, we expect to expand the offer from roughly 50 doors to over 80 doors this year. In addition, a new partnership with Madewell is another way for us to provide sought-after brands that appeal to new and existing customers.\nAnd finally, we view our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program as an important way for us to deepen our engagement with customers and attract new customers. Rewards members represent 40% of our sales volume. We welcomed over 1 million new members in 2014, a 15% increase from the previous year. We would like to give customers more choices with our loyalty program, and our goal is to provide an integrated, multi-tender program. Last year, we piloted an extension of our offering in Texas and in our first store in Canada. Based on the strong customer response, we look forward to rolling out the expanded program to all stores and online in the second half of the year.\nIn closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our customer strategy as we evolve with our customers through our focus on service, product and capabilities. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nThanks, Blake. As we wrap up another year, we are encouraged with the progress we've made in executing our customer strategy. Our efforts to provide a best-in-class customer experience are centered on service, product and capabilities. To reinforce Blake's comments, our strategy is driven by the changing expectations of our customers.\nAs our business evolves with the customer, the way we create value is evolving too. Over the last several years we have accelerated our investments to fuel growth across our businesses in full-price, off-price stores and online. About a decade ago, we started on a path of developing our multi-channel capabilities by integrating our buying teams and inventory platform. In 2011 we accelerated online growth starting with enhanced capabilities in e-commerce through the addition of talent, our acquisition of HauteLook and advancements in technology.\nIn 2012 we announced our planned investments in new growth opportunities including our entry into Canada, our Manhattan flagship store and the accelerated expansion of the Rack. Not only do these growth initiatives support our customer strategy, we expect these investments to drive top line growth and deliver returns accretive to our business.\nSince then, in addition to executing our growth plans we have increased our focus on our enterprise capabilities to enable a more seamless customer experience. This is reflected in the significant milestones achieved in 2014, including the launch of nordstromrack.com, our successful entry into Canada and the extension of our service approach through the acquisition of Trunk Club. As we look ahead, we plan to further leverage our strategic capabilities through technology, supply chain, merchandising and marketing.\nNow let's turn to our current financial results. We achieved our expectations for 2014, reflecting consistent strength in our sales trends and our investments to fuel growth. We added nearly $1 billion to our top line with record sales of over $13 billion. Our sales growth of 7.8% and comparable sales increase of 4% were ahead of our expectations. Our ongoing investments contributed to top line growth of roughly 25% from three years ago. Not only did our overall business generate growth, we've aggressively invested in Rack stores and e-commerce which collectively make up over 40% of our sales today, up from 30% three years ago.\nReturn on invested capital was 12.6% reflecting a 50 basis point reduction related to the Trunk Club acquisition and the accelerated pace of capital investments that have roughly doubled since 2011.\nFor the sixth consecutive year we generated operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion. Through our balanced capital allocation approach this past year we re-invested roughly $750 million back in the business and returned $860 million directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we announced last week our quarterly dividend which increased 12% over last year.\nEarnings per diluted share of $3.72 were consistent with our prior outlook of $3.70 to $3.75. Our results also included a $0.13 reduction from the Trunk Club acquisition which was incorporated in our prior outlook.\nNow, I'd like to comment further on our fourth quarter performance. Our earnings per diluted share of $1.32 were a result of continued sales strength and operating execution. We achieved total sales growth of 9% and a comparable sales increase of 4.7% reflecting a strong holiday performance. In our full-price business trends in full-line stores showed sequential improvement over the year with nordstrom.com demonstrating continued momentum. In our off-price business the Rack rebounded from the softness experienced late in the third quarter and our combined channel of nordstromrack.com and HauteLook delivered the highest growth.\nMoving to inventory and gross profit, we corrected our excess inventory at the Rack. We exited the year with inventory aligned to an appropriate level and gross profit performance consistent with our expectations. We are on track to achieve our goals of top quartile shareholder return driven by a high single digit sales growth and mid-teens ROIC. We believe this will lead us to be a $20 billion-plus business by 2020 while creating significant shareholder value.\nAs we've shared with you previously we expect operating margins to reflect the near-term impact of our customer strategy. This includes investments in stores and online growth, the expansion into Canada and foundational capabilities. As a result we anticipate that these investments will contribute to double digit increases in depreciation and rent. EBITDAR, which excludes these components, provides an indication of our core operating performance. We continue to focus on profitable growth in our core business which is reflected by EBITDAR growth in line with sales growth. Additionally, we've made meaningful progress in increasing our operating efficiencies particularly in our full-line business and continue to evaluate our operating model throughout the company.\nMoving to our capital plan, we expect to invest $4.3 billion or 5% of sales over the next five years. Technology is 35% of the plan reflecting an increased shift towards foundational investments. This includes a merchandising solution that enables our growth and a seamless integration across our multiple channels. It also includes the expansion of our fulfillment network. This not only supports a $2.5 billion online business today that is anticipated to grow by over $1 billion in the next several years but also enables an integrated customer experience across stores and online.\nNew markets representing Canada and Manhattan make up 25% and new stores are 18%. The balance of 22% relates to reinvestment in stores, significantly down from 40% over the last five years due to our remodel prioritization towards high profile stores and improved efficiencies.\nNow I'd like to provide additional color on our 2015 capital plan of approximately $1.2 billion. Relative to our five-year capital plan, we expect that this year will represent our peak level of investment at roughly 8% of sales. The step-up in 2015 compared to $750 million in 2014 is primarily driven by new stores, including flagship stores in Vancouver, Toronto, and Manhattan. In addition, the plan incorporates three flagship store remodels in Seattle, Chicago, and San Francisco, and a new East Coast fulfillment center. As the pace of investments begins to moderate beyond 2015, we expect to see an improvement in earnings growth.\nFinally, I'd like to turn to our 2015 financial outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.65 to $3.80 incorporates total sales growth of 7% to 9%. We are planning a comparable store increase of 2% to 4% based on current trends. Our sales outlook assumes in full-price flat comparable sales at full-line stores and roughly a 20% total sales increase from our online business of nordstrom.com and Trunk Club with mid-teens growth at nordstrom.com.\nIn off-price, Rack total sales growth in the low double digits with a low single digit comparable sales increase and roughly a 25% increase from our combined channel of nordstromrack.com and HauteLook.\nOther considerations incorporated in our outlook impacting gross profit and SG&A include the following. The rollout into Canada, estimated as an EBIT loss of $60 million compared to $32 million in 2014. This increase includes infrastructure and preopening costs of new stores. As we shared with you previously, we believe this market ultimately represents a $1 billion-plus sales opportunity. We expect this level of loss will begin to decline in 2017 and will become accretive as we reach scale.\nIn addition, we anticipate $30 million in expenses associated with growth enablers, comprised of the additional fulfillment center and our expanded loyalty program planned in the second half of 2015. There is also an EBIT loss of roughly $30 million related to Trunk Club compared with a loss of $25 million in 2014. The dilutive impact is expected to moderate in 2016 resulting from increased operating profitability. These growth initiatives contribute to our 20% planned increase in depreciation and rent expense in 2015. EBITDAR when excluding the impact of Canada and Trunk Club is anticipated to grow roughly with sales.\nPlease also refer to the earnings release for additional assumptions and timing considerations contemplated in our outlook.\nBefore we close, we'd like to comment that the process in regards to our potential sale of our credit receivables is expected to wrap up in the first half of 2015. We look forward to our opportunities ahead as we continue on our path to provide a best-in-class customer experience and deliver top quartile shareholder returns.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Trina.\nTrina Schurman - Director, Investor Relations, Nordstrom, Inc.\nThank you, Mike. Before we get started with Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Yvonne, we'll now take our first question.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. And our first question today is from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Capital (sic) [Cowen and Company] (19:00).\nOliver Chen - Cowen Group, Inc.\nThanks a lot. Congrats to a solid finish and all the innovative initiatives ahead. We had a question related to the activity around the port slowdown and the earlier Easter. Do you feel like that's within your plans in terms of what you're seeing? Or how does that impact you in terms of your vendors? And just a quick follow-up; what's driving the main rationale behind your gross margin guidance? Do you feel like Rack is in a good place with respect to inventory? Thank you.\nBlake W. Nordstrom - President & Director\nOliver, this is Blake. I'll take the first part regarding the supply chain. Through the fourth quarter, we had some minor impacts but we felt it was immaterial. It predominantly, though, can impact flow, and as we have said for some time, our ability to have freshness and flow is important with our customers. So we watch it closely, and of late it's been more in the news. Pete was just in market and I know a number of the vendors are talking about it, but we have a pretty balanced approach and we work closely with our vendor partners. And to date, we've been able to manage it fairly well. But our team's watching it closely. I'll turn the gross margin part over to Mike.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nYes, Oliver, this is Mike. Our assumptions in gross margin was primarily driving that slight decrease from 2014 is occupancy costs, and it's the occupancy costs related to the continued growth of the Rack as well as the new stores we're opening, particularly the new ones in Canada.\nOliver Chen - Cowen Group, Inc.\nThanks a lot. Best regards.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nSure. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our new question is from Paul Lejuez from Wells Fargo.\nPaul L. Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nHey, guys. Thanks. Just wondering what you see Trunk Club ultimately growing to on the top line? And how do you think about the profitability of that business in a more mature state? Thanks.\nErik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP\nThis is Erik. As mentioned, Trunk Club was on a real high growth rate, more than doubled last year and it is planned to double again this year. We haven't publicly stated, but we think ultimately it can be, but we think it's a big business. I think it's safe to say that. Right now our focus is mainly around supporting their growth plan and there's areas like supply chain, alterations, some supply right around vendors that we can help them with. We had just last week here in Seattle, their Custom business which \u2013 you may know they have three parts to their business, they have the Trunk business that's basically online personal styling, they have five showrooms and the third part is their Custom business that they've taken on road before. We actually have that road show in our Downtown Seattle store last week and they're just at the very beginning of starting to find some synergies there. So that business, without being specific I'll tell you we think it could be very big.\nThe other part is a little less formal (22:11) is what they can do for our stores. Like that customer experience, we're testing some things there but we do believe there's ways they can help us. As you know our personal styling program, our stores is about 1,500 stylists that have been very important part of our growth. They do some different things with their styling. We think we can learn on them.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nPaul, this is Mike. I would also add, you may recall when we originally bought the business we indicated one of the things that we were impressed with was for a startup how quickly they had moved to breakeven operating profitability and we're learning a lot in terms of a small business that can scale relatively quickly and that also can apply some of those ways of doing business in a highly personalized way to be very profitable. So we're excited about what we can learn there as well.\nPaul L. Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nThanks, guys. Good luck.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nSure. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.\nMatthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nHey. Good afternoon, guys. So on capital priorities, you outlined that this year the $1.2 billion will be the multi-year peak and then you talked about an improved earnings growth rate following 2015. Could you just elaborate a little bit on the drivers of that?\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nSure, Matthew, this is Mike. Yes, well, 2015, there's a lot going on as we articulated, we've got some significant investments in our store openings in Canada which include some pretty large stores in Vancouver and Toronto, we have the continued ongoing investment in Manhattan which right now is purely a capital investment but is a fair amount of capital. And then in addition we are investing in our infrastructure to support all this growth \u2013 this growth is a wonderful thing but if you don't have the tools and systems to support it, it's not going to work very well. And so what you're seeing here is a kind of a coming together of a lot of activity in this year.\nPost 2015 as we start to see those capital outlays somewhat moderate and become more consistent, we should see the operating model start to catch up a little bit more for those investments and we should start to see earnings growth to be a little bit better than it's been in the last couple of years.\nMatthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nGreat. Best of luck.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital Market (sic) [Topeka Capital Markets] (24:38).\nDorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets\nThanks and good afternoon, everyone. Just wondered if you could provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the loyalty business. Clearly, you've continued to see impressive growth there helping to drive sales. And I was just curious the comment you made about more customers shopping in multiple channels. Clearly, that's a great driver too. So, in terms of the number of customers you added, what's the total number of customers you've got in the various loyalty programs at this point? And what percentage of that customer base, are actually shopping in multiple channels? And then just a little bit of color on the expanded program that you've piloted, if you could.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nSure, Dorothy, this is Mike. We've for the last roughly five years seen some really strong growth in our Nordstrom rewards program and that has been driven by program that has been entirely connected to one of our tenders, whether it's our debit card, whether it's our private label credit card, or our co-branded Visa card. And one of the things that we learned with our pilot this last year is we have a lot of customers out there and a lot of potential future customers that would love to engage with us but don't necessarily want to open up another tender.\nAnd so the addition to our overall loyalty offering is going to include a tender-neutral offering, which we're not going to disclose specifics yet but we will have a way of connecting with those customers other than through a credit card or a debit card. And the test we had both in Canada and in Texas really had some great results and reinforced to us that this is another way that we can connect and build lifetime loyalty with our customers. Currently today we have about 4.3 million active members in the rewards program. Last year we added about 1 million. Clearly, we add and (26:47) as the years go on, so we're constantly looking to engage with new customers.\nDorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets\nAnd just on the number of those shopping in more than one channel?\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nI don't really have that number with me but if at some point we have it, we'll certainly share it with you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Paul Swinand from Morningstar, Inc.\nPaul Swinand - Morningstar Research\nGood afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Question on you're growing the online channel in a number of different ways from the different acquisitions to improving the old acquisitions and obviously (27:28) your own Rack brand, et cetera, but are you seeing any new or changed productivity in the way you're acquiring customers or the way you're marketing to customers? In other words should that get a more efficient marketing productivity over time or is it getting harder to acquire customers as the comparison gets tougher?\nErik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP\nThis is Erik. It changes constantly, how the different variables, many different variables in acquiring customers online (28:05) change year-to-year. They change month-to-month. So what the mix is between all those different variables, we're constantly changing. (28:16) search engines and market \u2013 search engine optimization that we go through. So I wouldn't say it's necessarily getting harder but I will say that the mix is constantly changing and so we have to change accordingly.\nPaul Swinand - Morningstar Research\nCould you maybe just give us some color on what you're currently seeing for strategies that are working?\nErik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP\nNo. We really don't get into that.\nPaul Swinand - Morningstar Research\nOkay.\nErik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP\nAll right.\nPaul Swinand - Morningstar Research\nBest of luck. Thanks.\nErik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP\nThanks.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.\nJeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC\nGood afternoon, guys. Just want to clarify the profitability outlook for Canada. It sounded to me that 2017 is probably the year when losses are going to start coming down. So I just want to make sure I'm correct in understanding that it sounds like this will be a year of higher losses and then again 2016 will also be a year of even higher. Would that be correct?\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nJeff, this is Mike. We expect 2015 and 2016 to be relatively comparable in terms of the losses and then after we open all the stores and start to get some scale we'll see that get better in 2017.\nJeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC\nOkay. So just from a very high level in terms of when you start harvesting the benefits of your capital program, it sounds like this is probably going to be kind of the trough year where you see the greatest pressure on earnings and next year will still continue to see pressure but you would see positive earnings growth year-on-year?\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nThat's currently what we're seeing today.\nJeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC\nGot it. Okay. Thank you very much.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA.\nBarbara Wyckoff Siris - CLSA Americas LLC\nHi, everybody. Could you talk about the trends in women's sportswear and accessories what were the top performing categories? What's been disappointing? And then if you could comment, please, on your return rates? You know you're a few years into free shipping and free returns. Thanks.\nPeter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising\nHi. This is Pete. In women's sportswear specifically where we've had the most success, which is largely kind of around what we would call our young customer segment, and the leading brand and initiative there is the Topshop performance, which has been really very, very good. And I think it was mentioned in the comments we're expanding from 50 stores to 80 this year. And then the existing stores were comping really well there. That's been a great catalyst for women's apparel in total.\nI'd say the other category in women's apparel, there's really two that have been pretty good. Coats have been pretty good and dresses have been pretty solid. With the accessories, leading the way there has been our handbag business and then our jewelry business. Those have been probably the two categories that have been the best performing.\nBarbara Wyckoff Siris - CLSA Americas LLC\nAnd returns? Thanks.\nErik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP\nYeah, I'll take return rates. This is Erik. We've had free shipping, free returns on Nordstrom.com for three-and-a-half years now. So there really hasn't been any change since then. In off-price, we do charge, I think, for both of those. The important thing is the returns. Number one, returns is a big strategic subject for us. Being great for customers around returns is something that's long been part of our deal and that certainly includes online. For us, a big part of the value in our approach to returns is in having returns in the store. So online purchases being able to be return to our store, well over 60% of our Nordstrom.com returns end up at our full-line stores, well over 70% HauteLook and Nordstrom Rack returns end up at our Rack stores.\nLast year at Rack stores, that drove, as Blake mentioned, an additional million visits to our Rack stores. So there is an absolute synergy. The returns part is probably the easiest, biggest synergy subject for us to talk about when we talk about the synergies between our stores and online. Again, return rates have been pretty stable at Nordstrom.com and what we're seeing more is the benefits of linking it to our stores.\nBarbara Wyckoff Siris - CLSA Americas LLC\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Ed Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nEdward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.\nHi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, first, you guys did a lot to improve pricing transparency this year by kind of doing this we will not be undersold, and then also I guess by changing the sales pattern that you have. I guess, as you hindsight the year, did you get the kind of gross profit and sales return you would have liked out of those two initiatives? And then I guess as a follow-up, I think you mentioned that the new DC was to support free two-day shipping. So I guess when does that get put into place? Is there any other negative impact to the P&L from that? Thank you.\nPeter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising\nThis is Pete. Well I think with regards to the pricing, that was not intended to be a near-term lever to drive results, that's much more of a long-term value proposition with customers based on a desire to gain trust and loyalty and confidence over time and it's important for us to be transparent on that whole pricing subject. And with the way that online business has done now, the customers are way more enabled and they've got a lot of information and we've got be respectful of that, responsive to it. So that's just driven how we've adjusted some of our pricing velocity, most is still based in a bit of a reactionary thing.\nWe're trying to run a full-price business here. We have the natural rhythm cycles of markdowns that happen which gets addressed in our clearance strategy as you talked about going from those two (34:14) to that nearly to the six clearance events. But the promotional stuff is mostly just a reaction to what happens with some of the competition, that's leveled out a little bit here as the year has gone on and then where we are now and that things have moderated at least for now. I'm sorry, the second part of the question...\nBlake W. Nordstrom - President & Director\nI can take that.\nPeter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising\nOkay.\nBlake W. Nordstrom - President & Director\nThe new DC opening up, we haven't announced that we're going to free two-day shipping. The point was having an additional fulfillment center is it gets closer to a big chunk of customers. So about almost half of our customers are within a two-day ground delivery of that Pennsylvania fulfillment center. And so a big chunk of our orders for both customers will be one to three days faster for them than currently is. Now we will still ship some orders from our Cedar Rapids fulfillment center to the Northeast, we won't have a perfect allocation there but mainly we continue to focus on \u2013 and the long-term strategy here is to have a fulfillment network that gets practically all, at least over 90% of our customers in the United States within a two-day ground and this is one step in that direction.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nAnd the last part of your question, this is Mike, you asked about the cost of this and in our comments we noted that there's an anticipated $30 million increase in expense, we haven't broken out the DC but that included both the DC and the loyalty program.\nEdward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.\nGreat. Thanks so much, guys.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nSure, Ed.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.\nKimberly Conroy Greenberger - Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nGreat. Thank you. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on an earlier comment you made. You mentioned that you expect earnings growth to reaccelerate after this sort of thrust of the investment program, it sounded like that reacceleration would happen around 2017. Is that a correct read on it? Or do you think it's more the 2018 timeframe? And then just a clarification on your Trunk Club comments, I think you mentioned that you were all quite impressed with how quickly the Trunk Club business model was able to get to breakeven. I think you mentioned that it delivered a $25 million loss in 2014 for Nordstrom and $30 million in 2015 is expected. Is that differential just a step-up from purchase accounting? Or is there something about acquiring Trunk Club that actually caused them to go from breakeven to a loss situation?\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nSure, Kimberly. Thanks for your questions. On the first one, I think what we were saying is post-2015 we would start to see earnings growth improve. I don't think we used the word accelerate but we thought it would improve beginning after the peak year of 2015 investment. The second part on Trunk Club is we did indicate operating profitability at breakeven. And you're right. The losses are related to the amortization of the purchase accounting. So that's what contributes to that total $25 million that you mentioned.\nKimberly Conroy Greenberger - Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nSuper helpful. Thank you.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nSure.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.\nPaul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nGood afternoon. $20 billion in sales by 2020 sounds pretty conservative to me but using your forecast, how should we think about the margin profile of that business? I think you finished this year around 15% EBITDAR, Mike. How should we think about the next few years, especially on the SG&A front?\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nYeah, well, Paul it might sound conservative in the numbers but it's a heck of a lot of effort to get there. We think we have a pretty good plan and $20 billion is a good target for us. But, anyway, in terms of how we think about the profitability, I'd go back to what's been our longstanding guidance and that's been the high single-digit sales growth and mid-teens ROIC. It's very difficult to predict precise margins over shorter periods of time but our goal is to target those two numbers, and achieving them over that longer period should generate some pretty significant value.\nPaul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nAll right. Thank you.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.\nNeely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)\nGreat. Good afternoon. Can we dig a little bit more into the Trunk Club integration timeline? At this point, have you guys flipped the switch, the proverbial switch, wherever that is, with fulfilling Trunk Club orders through Cedar Rapids at this point? Or where are you in that progression? And is that contemplated in the 2015 dilutive impact? Thank you.\nErik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP\nHi, Neely, this is Erik. No, to answer your question. We're not fulfilling Trunk Club orders out of Cedar Rapids at this point. They have a \u2013 they're doing that out of Chicago. What we're helping them with is really it's part of our supply chain network. While not in the physical location of Cedar Rapids, our team is supporting that. An easy, tangible example is we've got Trunk Club on our shipping contract with UPS, a significant savings with that. And as our long-term supply chain strategy is to have everything integrated. That includes our fulfillment centers, our DC, our stores, and long-term we've sort of looked for Trunk Club to be part of that. But in the short-term, they continue to be fulfilled out of Chicago.\nNeely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.\nHeather N. Balsky - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.\nHi. Good afternoon. This is Heather Balsky on for Lorraine. Could you talk a little bit about your inventory plan going forward, especially for the Rack? How are you thinking about pack and hold investment? And then also just could you provide some color on how you're getting to the 300 store target for the Rack? What is that based on? Thanks.\nBlake W. Nordstrom - President & Director\nHeather, this is Blake. Our pack and hold has been fairly consistent now over the last I'd say year and half or two years. It's about 11% of the total company's inventory, and so we continue through the vendor partnerships and relationships, have terrific access to product that closeout the end of the season that we're able to really pack and hold in the warehouse and use the following \u2013 you know, six months later. It helps us turn the corner in each of the existing stores and particularly is a key component for the new store growth. We mentioned that we opened 27 stores last year and 27 this year. Pack and hold enables us to execute that. So that's an approach with our vendor partnerships and vendor \u2013 our inventory maximizations that we're really pleased with and working well.\nIn terms of the 300 stores, it's a pretty fluid model, opening the Racks in terms of the lead-time, particularly compared to full-line stores, and we're just learning with each one and we continue to get great reception from the customer. I think it's really reflected in, and we've shared this before, on the productivity of the stores. They both maintain and enhance slightly with the addition of these new stores.\nSo we're encouraged by those opportunities. Sometimes there's some vagaries in the retail real estate market year-to-year but we feel very confident looking ahead between now and 2020. Given the criteria we use for new stores, the customer demand, the opportunities that are out there, that we feel very confident to publicly state that we should have bigger stores by 2020.\nHeather N. Balsky - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.\nStephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nThanks. Good afternoon. I have a few follow-ups to earlier questions. I guess first, can you provide any update on the potential credit card sale and remind us on how you were thinking about capital allocation related to those proceeds? And then, as an unrelated follow-up. As you get to the 300 Rack store target, how are you thinking about the margin for this segment on an absolute basis? And any kind of directional basis you can give relative to the other channels? Thanks.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nSure, Steve, this is Mike. In terms of the credit card profit, as we indicated in our comments, we're very pleased with the progress to date. And we've learned a lot through this process and actually it's been more enlightening in terms of how we think we can better serve our customers going forward. So, we're excited about that.\nShould we be successful, we would look at the proceeds the same way, through the same filters that we've always thought about capital allocation and that is first and foremost we always reinvest back in the business. That's where we get the highest returns and any excess capital that we have we'll return it to shareholders. And we're going to put any proceeds we might get through that identical lens.\nIn terms of the Rack, the Rack has and consistently operates with a four-wall operating margin consistent with the full-line stores. As we go through this accelerated phase, you have a little bit of a blip because you're recognizing brands on an accelerated basis before the store opens. But, as those new stores start to become a smaller piece of the pie, we should see that four-wall contribution start to get back to what is a more normal run rate.\nStephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nThat's very helpful. Thanks so much. Best of luck this year.\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nThanks, Stephen.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.\nMatthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI\nHi, Thanks for taking my question. You have a lot of moving pieces with Rack in the fourth quarter. So I have kind of a two part on Rack. As far as the gross margin, how much of that decline in the gross margin rate was unplanned versus liquidating inventory position that you built in the third quarter? And then the second part of that, as it played out at the register at Rack, I mean you likely had ASP compression I assume based on that markdown, but your comp was okay, it was actually better than the third quarter. Did you see a new customer come in or did the customer that was coming in the store otherwise just had a bigger basket as they saw the price decline?\nBlake W. Nordstrom - President & Director\nWell Matt, this is Blake. We talked about in our last call that our inventories were high in the Racks, and so the team worked really hard and we're pleased that they were able to take that situation and get back in line and be current with our inventories today in one quarter. It did have, as you talked about \u2013 mentioned an impact on the margin. We had to accelerate some markdowns. We didn't see a material change in the average price, nor did we see any change, let's say per se, with our customer that \u2013 our diverse customer that shops with us. So, the actual execution of the business was very consistent.\nBusiness did pick up. We don't talk about weather but when things got a little colder in November, things like outerwear got better and our Rack business got back to a trend that we'd been seeing prior. But the third quarter was a little softer. We think we're in a good position here as we start the new year, both at the Rack and all of our businesses when it comes to inventory. And so we're real fluid at this point.\nMatthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And we do have time for one final question. Our last question today comes from Joan Payson from Barclays.\nJoan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nHi, good afternoon. Could you talk a little bit about the five-year capital plan and the Canada earnings expectations and whether those include the ultimate plan for Rack stores and an e-commerce launch or would those be incremental?\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nI'm sorry. The first part of the question was the capital plan and as it relates to the Canada earnings?\nJoan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nSo on a separate basis, basically, the new five-year capital plan and also the Canada earnings expectations, do those include Canada Rack and Canada e-commerce? Or would those...\nMichael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\nGot it. Got it. Yes. Thank you for clarifying that. Those do include a placeholder for Canada Rack stores but do not include a placeholder for Canada e-commerce at this point.\nBlake W. Nordstrom - President & Director\nJust on Canada e-commerce, we do currently do quite a business online in Canada through our dot-com site. Our business picked up significantly with the opening of our store, especially around Calgary. We're seeing the reverse synergy. We've always had stores before we had a website. The first place where we had a website before we had a store and the store opening has lifted our business.\nTrina Schurman - Director, Investor Relations, Nordstrom, Inc.\nAgain, thank you for joining today's call. A replay along with the slide presentation and prepared remarks will be available for one year on our website. Additionally, you'll find a summary of our performance and growth strategy at the end of the slide presentation. Thank you for your interest in Nordstrom.\nOperator\nThank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.\n\n",

Jagdfeld \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnalysts\n\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\n\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nI am Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch machinery analyst, and we have here the management of Generac. We have Aaron Jagdfeld, Company\u2019s President and CEO, and York Ragen, the Company\u2019s CFO.\nGenerac produces power units. In fact, I was chatting with Aaron about getting one for my in-laws. And the company has experienced rapid growth as due to sort of unforeseen weather events, and increased adoption of the product, and it\u2019s a very interesting story. \nAnd I\u2019ll let Aaron talk about it. Thank you very much for being here.\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\n\nThanks, Andrew. As Andrew said, I\u2019m Aaron Jagdfeld, President and Chief Executive Officer at Generac. With me is York Ragen, our CFO. I\u2019m not sure how familiar you are with the company, and we can go through these pretty quickly, these slides. We got a prepared deck here, and maybe leave a little more time for Q&A for those of you guys that are in attendance here, and skip lunch to be with us. So one of the downsides of presenting at 11:45 apparently.\nBut as Andrew said, I think there are a couple of things that from a highlight standpoint make this a very attractive investment. The first of which is just the rapid growth the company has experienced with the adoption of our residential products, and I\u2019ll get into that, the second and that has led to best-in-class organic revenue growth. \nWe have created the backup power space at the residential market side, what we call the home standby generator market. That\u2019s a category we effectively created about 12 years ago. We\u2019re the market leader in that category, and we\u2019ve created significant barriers to entry that I\u2019ll cover here as well.\nWe have a financial profile that is pretty unique for a company like ours, and you\u2019ll see that demonstrated in some of the financial information we\u2019ll share with you, but in particular, the free cash flow generation of this company, no pun intended is very dramatic, relative to a company of our size, in terms of the percentage of our EBITDA that we convert to free cash flow. So we\u2019ll cover that as well.\nI think one of the last highlights too is that, we have strong market product opportunities outside of the U.S., 99% of our revenues today are generated in the U.S. and Canada. So here we have this kind of homegrown story here in the U.S. and the U.S market, but we\u2019ve got an entire world out there that we\u2019ve only began to scratch the surface on. So those four characteristics we believe are significant in terms of how you want to view this as an investment going forward.\nJust a little bit about the business, about the company, was founded in 1959 by an engineer, we\u2019re located just west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, about 30 minutes west. It was founded as a portable generator manufacturer actually. These are the small gasoline power portable gens that you\u2019d see and they\u2019re very prevalent and typical during widespread outages, people run to Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s to buy these types of products, those are the types of products that the company actually began building back in the late 50s, actually really invented that category as well.\nBut today we offer a wide range of products, all the way from those, we still offer those small portable generators. Although it\u2019s a very large industrial systems for backup of data centers, hospitals, supermarkets, waste water treatment plants and those types of things.\nOur LTM sales here through Q2 is approximately $1.1 billion, and that breaks down about 58% of that being residential, which again are those permanently installed home standby generators as well as the small portable products that we have. And the balance 36% is in the commercial and industrial market where frankly we\u2019re a smaller player, more focused in the niche space of natural gas, which I\u2019ll explain here in a second on why that\u2019s been a good thing to us in the last few years in particular. \nWe have about 2,200 employees and about 1.2 million square feet of manufacturing, most of that located in Wisconsin. This is a slide that I think, many companies would be envious of relative to the growth trajectory, top line as it were here, about a 15% CAGR over the last 11 years, and that\u2019s on an organic basis.\nThe last two bars that you see there, the two larger bars, the gold colored piece of those bars actually represent the transaction, the first significant transaction of size from an acquisition standpoint that we did last year in a company called Magnum Products, and I\u2019ll get into that here in a second. But all of the rest of those bars, all the orange portions of those bars are actually organic growth. So, no M&A of significance in the company\u2019s history prior to last year.\nAnd that is really, again, a testament to some of the product categories that we\u2019ve created here in (inaudible) like the home standby generator category. Some of the innovations that we brought to market in natural gas technology, some of the innovations we brought to market in different ways to deploy our industrial systems have also been drivers of growth over that period of time.\nAnd so it\u2019s really a history of innovation that underpins what we do as a company. The company was founded on innovation in 1959, and continues to innovate. And we believe that the innovation is a significant component of and a driver of growth going forward here into the future.\nFrom the product offering standpoint, just graphically represented here, if you look on the left hand side of this graphic on the residential products, you\u2019re going to see at the top the power washer category, which is a new space for us. We\u2019ve only been in that market a little over a year. It was a category that we\u2019re in quite a bit deeper than that. Back in the 1990s, we pioneered the consumerization of that product category of retail. That was packaged up and sold as part of the business in 1998, along with our portable generator business.\nSo we were number one in North America in power washers and portable generators in 1998. We sold that business to private equity. They in turn sold it to Briggs & Stratton. So today, Briggs & Stratton owns the former Generac portable products business, where we were leaders in that space. We\u2019ve reentered after the expiration of a non-compete, both in the portable generator space as well as the power washer space, and those are the products you see listed there at the top on the left hand side.\nThe bottom on the left hand is the permanently installed systems. The second from the bottom would be probably our most popular system, those air-cooled home standby generators as they\u2019re referred to. Air-cooled because that is how they are cooled down. They have no radiator. So a liquid-cooled generator will have a radiator much as same as a car or a truck.\nAnd obviously at price points, if you look on the left hand side, they\u2019d kind of climb with those products, with power washers kind of being at the bottom of the price point curve, liquid-cooled home standby generators being at the top of that. Again that represents 58% of our revenues on that side.\nOn the right hand side, those would be representative graphics of the products that we sell for our C&I markets. The first three products there are pictures of products that we acquired from the Magnum Products Company last year in October. So that\u2019s a construction light tower that you see at the top there, that company is number one in North America in light tower sales.\nThese are the types of, basically it\u2019s a fixed application generator. It\u2019s used in road construction, as more road construction goes over the night time. It\u2019s used in oil and gas patch type of anywhere the extraction or exploration is going on, there isn\u2019t a permanent source of electricity or lighting, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see light towers. You\u2019re also going to see them in commercial construction as well.\nMobile generators, another product category that they brought to us, with that purchase. Again wherever you\u2019d need temporary power, you\u2019re going to see those types of products; mobile pumps, de-watering, removal of flood waters or de-watering a construction site.\nAnd then the bottom two products here on the right hand side will be pictures of what our permanently installed commercial and industrial set look like. Again, you are going to see these in small footprint retail type installations, convenient stores, small bank branches; that\u2019s going to be on the commercial side. And then on the bottom there, the industrial sets, which are more primarily diesel power gensets. You\u2019re going to see those in hospitals and data centers in larger applications.\nJust stepping back for a second, if you are a generator manufacturer, I think it\u2019s important to point out a few kind of macro drivers for the demand side of power generation. And that really is the grid; the age of the grid, the tremendous underinvestment in the grid over the last three decades. \nIt\u2019s been great for homeowners like everybody in this room, kept your utility rates low but the way that\u2019s been accomplished is by the 3200 different independent grid operators that are out there under-investing in the big-ticket items such as transmission and distribution. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been able to keep your rates low, which has been fantastic for us personally, but unfortunately where we\u2019ve suffered is in reliability.\nAnd you can see that bar chart there on the left hand side really, I think points out that it\u2019s the best graphic that we can give people that this is a real issue, it\u2019s not an issue that obviously we have mistaken it being an issue because we are a generator manufacturer. But frankly, these are statistics accumulated by the North American Reliability Council, which is a government entity, and that government entity tracks the number of outages that happen across the U.S.\nThis bar graph represents the number of major outages, those outages that impact more than 50,000 people at a time. And you can see that, that\u2019s growing and at a compounded annual growth rate of 17% since 1993. And we don\u2019t have the data from NRRC, it\u2019s not available yet for 2011, otherwise we\u2019d put that up there. But we suspect based on other independent sources that we use that number is going to go quite a bit higher even in 2011. \nSo it continues to demonstrate, and we think that this is highly correlated; the reliability issue here is highly correlated to the age of the grid. The average grid components are over 40 years in age, that\u2019s poles, lines, transformers, all the actual hard infrastructure around the grid is aging very quickly and it\u2019s leading to some significant issues.\nThe other macro item that we would point to, it\u2019s not just the aging grid, but in particular as it relates to the opportunity on our residential market, is the aging population. There are \u2013 the 80% of the buyers of these systems are over age 50. And that is one of the largest segments of the population in terms of growth going forward. But why is that? Why are 80% of the buyers of home standby generators over age 50? Well, frankly, homeownership skews to over age 50, disposable income level skew to over age 50, people who appreciate insurance like homeowners insurance skews older in society.\nAnd so you can think of a home standby generator as a basic extension for most people of that homeowners\u2019 insurance policy. It\u2019s for property protection, but even as you get older, it goes beyond property protection and it starts to get into areas of life safety. So things that you probably wouldn\u2019t think about, but there are quite a few more home medical devices being brought into the home. People want to stay in their home as long as possible.\nSo and this is what we were talking with Andrew about with his in-laws is that people want to extend their independence, right, they want to stay in the house that they raise their kids in, now they\u2019re going to retire and the homes paid off, but to live in that house, okay, and if power reliability is an issue, you compromise your independence very quickly. If you can\u2019t control whether it\u2019s home medical devices, whether it\u2019s refrigeration of medications, whether it\u2019s climate control, which is the big one, right, if it\u2019s cold outside, you can\u2019t turn on the heat when the power is out, or if it\u2019s hot outside, you can\u2019t put on the air; that\u2019s a real problem as you age. Basic mobility within the house, when it\u2019s dark, that becomes a problem as well.\nSo again, the category skews older and we think that the demographic shift in the U.S. plays favorably into this market over the long-term. So aging grid, aging population, the confluence of those two things and those are kind of big large macro driving forces that are not going to change very quickly here in the next 10, 20, 30 years, right.\nThe baby boomers are going to continue to retire at an amazing rate over the next 20 years. That\u2019s when people will clearly realize that, that is a tremendously long cycle. And as they age and they want to stay in those homes longer, they\u2019re going to need to extend their independence by having appliances like a home standby generator.\nThe other part of this graphic and the reason we spent so much time on this slide is really on the second half here is the penetration story of those home standby generators. And we did some proxy to other installed home systems on what might this penetration rate be? Today, it\u2019s only 2.5% of U.S. households that actually have a home standby generator installed. And for us, the addressable market is only 50 million U.S. homes. It\u2019s single family, unattached housing stock greater than $100,000 in value.\nSo we take out all the multi-tenant buildings, we take out all the intercity housing stock or the stock where, frankly you\u2019re just not going to find somebody to invest in a product like this in a home that\u2019s less than $100,000 in value.\nThat subset of the 120 million homes in the U.S. is 50 million homes. Of that 50 million, 2.5% of those homes have a home standby generator installed. Every 1% of penetration is a $2 billion market opportunity. We own 70% market share in home standby generator space. So we believe that, that is an incredibly attractive opportunity relative to improving the adoption rates for these products. They suffer from low adoption rates today because it\u2019s still a relatively new category.\nWe invented the category about 12 years ago. And so there\u2019s just, frankly, not enough people who know that what this product does, where they can find it, how much it costs. And so, the low awareness level, we believe, is something that is our focal point going forward to increase this penetration rate. Again every 1% is $2 billion.\nOther installed home systems, central air conditioning has a 70% plus rate of penetration. I don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s been around since the 1940s, it\u2019s taken that long to hit the 70%. I don\u2019t know that home standby generators can be 70% at some point, I do know that the 12% of our U.S. households have a portable generator.\nAnd again, portable generators have been around since the 1950s, when we started the category. The replacement cycle on portable generator is between 12 and 15 years. This category is relatively new at 12 years, the home standby generator category. \nClearly, if you are a home owner having a permanently installed fully automatic system that runs off of natural gas of propane like our home standby generators, provides a tremendous amount of additional utility and value than a portable generator that you have to pull out of your garage, you got to be home when the power is out, pull out that portable generator that you haven\u2019t run for a few years out of your garage, pour gasoline from somewhere in your garage into that unit, fire it up and plug in extension cords to power up what you want to power up.\nIt works and you can make it work, and that\u2019s how people solved power outages before the fully automatic permanent systems came to be. But as those systems age, the portable generators, we believe that when people come back into the market, they\u2019re going to see the opportunity to step up to something like this, like this home standby category.\nAnd so we believe that that\u2019s something going forward that is really indicative of the type of opportunity in terms of penetration rate, where this category could go longer term. \nSo just shifting gears a little bit on here to the commercial and the industrial space because we\u2019ve talked a lot about residential and we\u2019re 70% share on the residential space, but on the commercial and industrial space, we\u2019re only a 15% share player in the permanently installed systems. From a macro standpoint, the drivers for demand in the commercial and industrial markets, we listed two kind of major drivers up here and they probably impact more our business given the products that we\u2019re involved with.\nBut on the left hand side, there is a secular shift that\u2019s going on towards backup power generation being more focused on natural gas fueled than diesel historically, and backup power generation in industrial systems have been around for over 80 years, historically they\u2019ve been diesel powered. \nSo if somebody takes a diesel truck engine, you can take it from a mine haul cart, or you can take it from a marine application, and it\u2019s put into a generator and it runs off a diesel fuel. That is how backup powers themselves for nearly 80 years.\nIn the last 10 years, backup power is starting to shift more to natural gas, and obviously natural gas availability has improved dramatically here with all of the gas shale plays that are out there, and the pricing of natural gas has come down dramatically as well as the fuel source. But that\u2019s not the primary driver of why nat gas gensets are beginning to displace diesel powered gensets in the marketplace. It\u2019s for the simple fact that a like-for-like, a natural gas set under 200 kilowatt is less expensive than a diesel set; it wasn\u2019t always the case. Diesel engines have been made in mass in the types of ranges that we are talking about on the 200 kilowatt set for truck applications for long time. The problem is as the emissions regulations have picked up over the last several years, the cost of that diesel engine has gone up dramatically, 2x, 3x, even 4x from Tier 4 to Tier 0.\nAnd so the cost of the engine is the largest cost component of the generator. So as you can imagine, the cost of a diesel generator, the street price of a diesel generator has gone up dramatically in the last several years, kind of marching alongside increases in diesel engine technology and the cost of diesel engines.\nIt\u2019s not that gas engines are less regulated. Frankly, they\u2019re just as much regulated. Any gas engine in your vehicle is regulated very heavily. It\u2019s no different off-road for products that are powered by natural gas. The major difference is the fuel source that turns out clear. Natural gas is a lot cleaner as a fuel than diesel fuel. So it needs less pre-treatment and less after-treatment in the generator itself versus a diesel system.\nAnd so, all the after-treatment that goes into diesel engine technology is going to drive that price. That is creating an opportunity for companies like Generac that are very focused on natural gas.\nEven though we\u2019re only 15% share in the total commercial industrial market, we\u2019re number one in terms of market share for nat gas products. It\u2019s a niche space within power generation, but it\u2019s a space we\u2019ve been in for over 30 years, and we perfected the fuel systems and the technologies that go with those fuel systems to power those natural gas sets.\nAnd it\u2019s made us really the leader in that industry over the last 30 years. It\u2019s only been in the last few years that the shift from diesel to nat gas has been accelerating, and so we\u2019re benefiting from that accelerated shift. And that\u2019s something that is a big driver of our growth, we believe, going forward in the future, at least as it relates to C&I.\nThe other side of that macro picture for us is again another secular trend shift from the shift from buying equipment to renting equipment. So this graphic here on the right hand side was actually I lifted this from the United Rentals deck they put together when they purchased RSC, Rental Service Corp.\nTheir thesis, their investment thesis in that purchase was that contractors, road contractors, commercial contractors and others, were shifting from instead of buying the equipment outright and owning it with some kind of a lien to a bank or a note to a bank on it, they would rather rent that equipment. And the reason that, that shift is occurring in the marketplace is really driven by the depth of the last recession and the pullback.\nContractors found themselves without any business but they still own this equipment, and they also own the note to the bank on the equipment. And so banks were reprocessing a lot of secondary equipment and putting out in the secondary market a lot of the types of equipment that Magnum sells like mobile generators, light towers, but even beyond that, bulldozers, I mean big, big construction equipment.\nSo there has been a shift that contractors come to the realization that they would rather rent that equipment, maybe pay a little bit of a premium to rent it. But if the market dries up, they can turn the rental in, they can go back to United Rentals or they can go back to RSC or Hertz and say, I\u2019m done renting that, the rental period is ended. \nThey have no obligation beyond the rental period. So they can better match their expenses with the revenues. And so that is the real shift that\u2019s happening and that\u2019s been beneficial for our Magnum business, again the business we bought last October. So those two macro themes are very prevalent in our C&I business.\nI think if there is one slide in this deck that you take something away from today about Generac it\u2019s this distribution slide. This is not only a differentiating factor for Generac versus some of our competitors, but it also represents what I believe to be a very significant barrier to entry for others who are looking at our 70% share on the residential market in particular and saying, I want to be in that market as well. If 1% equals to $2 billion, then maybe we should be in that market as well, meaning somebody else.\nAnd so, what\u2019s significant about this is our distribution philosophy, as it relates to residential products, differs very dramatically from the distribution philosophy employed to lot of other industries. It\u2019s a very open philosophy in distribution. We\u2019ll sell online to people like Amazon.com, we\u2019ll sell to wholesalers and industrial supply companies like Grainger. We\u2019ll sell our products to electrical wholesalers like Rexel or Graybar. We\u2019ll sell direct to 4,400 electrical contractors, we\u2019ll sell into retailers like Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot and others, you can find those products there.\nBasically, wherever you shop, however you buy product, if you want to buy a turnkey solution from a dealer, if you feel comfortable buying something from Home Depot and taking it home on a Saturday and more of a DIY project or if you want to buy it online, if you\u2019re comfortable putting down your credit card for $3000 online. How you shop is how we want you to find the product. Who are we as a manufacturer to limit you and your choice in buying the product? We feel very strongly about this in terms of this open philosophy. \nWe also feel that it\u2019s a very important part when you have a category of product that\u2019s still relatively new and is severely under-penetrated as home standby generators that the ability to find that product in more outlets is really key to us driving awareness for those products.\nSo that is a big part of the philosophy as well is not only the fact that we believe in free markets and allowing you to have choice on where you buy products, but it\u2019s also allowing us to drive awareness by having more, call it more points of light out there to distribute the product. That\u2019s a big part of the strategy and that\u2019s what\u2019s represented on the left hand side, there is all the different ways that we go to market. All of the dots on this map or the pushpins here represent the 4,400 dealer locations that we have around the U.S. We have amassed those dealer locations over the last 10 years.\nWe add between 300 and 400 new dealers every year on that basis. And again, it\u2019s taken us a good solid 10, 11 years to get to the 4,400 that we have today. We spend a tremendous amount of money every year on boarding those new dealers and training them, technical training and sales training. \nThese are electrical contractors. They are not natural born sale people. They are great people. They are great hardworking people, but they don\u2019t sell products for living, okay, they wire homes and they work on projects. They bid a project. They come in. They pull wires through the basement. They do the project. They get paid. They leave. They don\u2019t try and sell you anything over there. So they don\u2019t have natural sales skills.\nWhat we\u2019re trying to do is turn that 4,400 dealer base into a sales force for these products. We have to teach them how to sell. Simple things, it\u2019s a kitchen table sales pitch. They are coming into your home and they are trying to convince you and your family on why you want this product. That takes a certain amount of sales skill, certain amount of salesmanship. How to overcome objections, whether it\u2019d be price or location of the product or the amount of time it takes to have it installed, whatever the objections are, those are, it sounds very 101 kind of sales 101, but that\u2019s when we start out with electrical contractors, it\u2019s sales 101.\nWe do a lot of sales training and we do a tremendous amount of technical training. They are very comfortable on the electrical side of the machine. They are not as comfortable on the engine side of the machine. They are not mechanically inclined as it relates to repairing an engine. So there is a lot of technical training that we have to put into that channel, that dealer base, in order to get them to be proficient in repairing the products when needed.\nSo that is a, that investment and distribution, I think, represents, as I said before, one of the largest barriers to entry we have out there as a company, because somebody else, if they wanted to get into this market and they wanted to be good at it, they have to replicate that, because the last thing you want is, if you have this product, you spent $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 in this product and it doesn\u2019t work for whatever reason, either because you haven\u2019t maintained it or there is a problem with the machine, you need a dealer close by to come and repair it quickly, that\u2019s why you own it.\nDuring an outage, if it doesn\u2019t work, it becomes a big paperweight, a big lawn ornament in your yard, okay. And that is not only an irritating thing to you, but frankly, it takes away from detracting the value proposition for the product. So the ability to have a large network of dealers that we can deploy quickly, right, to repair that product is incredibly important in this industry. And so that\u2019s something that somebody is going to have to really work on if they want to replicate that.\nOn the right hand side of this graphic is the way we go to market with our commercial and industrial sets, and that looks a lot more traditional. Traditional two-step industrial distribution model, we have 50 industrial distributors around the U.S. who are interfacing with local contractors, local specifying engineering firms. The industrial products that we manufacture are highly specialized. They\u2019re made-to-order type products and they take a fair amount of engineering work. And we work with engineers in the field to specify the solution set that\u2019s necessary for each individual project. And so we go to market there through much, many fewer points of light.\nNow just strategically speaking, a couple of things here on strategy, and then we can shift into Q&A. The strategy of Generac is quite simple. The first is to grow our residential market, how do we get that next 1% of penetration, okay. We believe there are three key drivers. It\u2019s driving awareness, its driving availability, and its driving affordability. If we can focus on those three things, we can get that next 1% of penetration, which again represents a huge amount of market opportunity. That is a core component of the strategy.\nAnother core component of the strategy is the upper right hand corner, which is to gain industrial share. We want to take that 15% share position we have and we want to move it up. We think through improvements in distribution and through extensions in our product offering and continuing to focus on natural gas, we believe that we\u2019re going to build our share position in C&I.\nThe bottom two pieces of the strategy, diversification of our end markets, we are a generator manufacturer, kind of at our core, which is great. Weather does impact, Andrew mentioned that at the beginning here that weather certainly impact some of our business, in terms of increasing demand for certain products, particularly, when it gets to portable generators and probably more so on our residential standby sets. Those are going to be more sensitive to major outage events.\nThe diversification of our business into other product lines and other markets should help stabilize the revenue so that we don\u2019t have the kind of ups and downs that are difficult to run a company that have 2,200 employees, waiting for Mother Nature to deliver. We can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s not a responsible way to run a company, both for our employees or for our investors.\nSo, diversification, you can look at the Magnum purchase last October has really a key component of executing on that part of our strategy. We\u2019ve got into light towers, we\u2019ve got into mobile generators, we\u2019ve got into mobile pumps. These are products that are not dependent on major outage events occurring, okay. They gave us access to new end markets, like oil and gas, like road construction, like commercial construction that we weren\u2019t serving before. So entr\u00e9e the new markets with new products is part of that diversification play.\nAnd last but not least, my opening comment before that 99% of our revenues are in the U.S and Canada. It\u2019s been a huge opportunity worldwide to take our products, which are very extendable outside of North America and take them to the rest of the world. We just haven\u2019t focused on it, because we\u2019ve had to tag you by the tail in terms of what\u2019s going on here in North America with our residential business.\nSo because of that, we focused our energies into growing that business. And it\u2019s not that executing on any one piece of the strategy will de-emphasize what we want to do in terms of growing the residential market, but we do think our opportunities if we resource appropriately to grow the company further when it comes to new geographies.\nJust briefly here financially as we talked, about $1.1 billion in revenues overall in the LTM period to Q2. Our adjusted EBITDA in that same LTM period now is just short of $260 million. The key graphic here at the lower left hand corner is the free cash flow, the unlevered free cash flow through Q2 on an LTM basis is almost $212 million. It\u2019s a huge, I mean, and there are three reasons why. One is, we have great margins in this business, okay. You can see the line graph in the upper right hand, upper left hand side, 36.4% gross margin, okay, great margins in this business, our EBITDA margins are in the low 20%, 20% to 25% depending on the year. So we generated tremendous amount of cash flow through our EBITDA, frankly through our profitability.\nThe second thing is the low CapEx business. There is just not a lot of CapEx we set this year publicly CapEx between $15 million and $17 million. So it\u2019s a very low CapEx, less than 2% of sales. And the third piece is we have a fantastic tax attribute in this company. When the company was sold by the founder in 2006, there was a leverage by our transaction sold to private equity and it created a massive tax shield, effectively through a piece of the tax curve, we were able to step up the basis of the assets, amortize that over a 15 year period, and that effectively creates a $49 million cash tax shield every year.\nSo the first $49 million of our cash tax goes to the shield, goes against the shield. So effectively, our cash taxes every year are nominal, less than $1 million just in local taxes and other things that we pay for local governments. And so the free cash flow power of this company is really the summation of those three things. And really I think it\u2019s a testament to the type of business we built in over a 50 year period, but really in the last 10 years.\nWe\u2019ve got some relative comp sets here to kind of illustrate best-in-class in terms of our five year sales CAGR, in terms of our free cash flow yield in particular, which you would expect with the kind of free cash flow generation this company has. Our EBITDA margins on an LTM period in some respectable company there in terms of the top 10 peer group and then our EV-to-EBITDA multiple, when you adjust for the valuation of that tax shield, puts us at about a 9.2 handle on an LTM period.\nThe business outlook for 2012, we\u2019ve reiterated this, you can look at the transcripts. But effectively, we\u2019ve raised guidance off of our Q2 earnings, and so we\u2019ve now said that we see net sales increasing in the low 20% range for the year versus strong 2011. Adjusted EBITDA, we said high-teens range versus 2011. We said interest expense for the current year will be between $49 million and $50 million. In the following year, it\u2019ll go up slightly.\nWe did do a special dividend here that we paid out in the June timeframe and we did lever up a little bit. We\u2019re at about 3.5 times right now, net debt-to-EBITDA, and that, those debt service costs should rise between $60 million and $65 million next year. We are going to continue to convert our EBITDA to cash flow at a very aggressive rate. You can see that from 2009 to 2011, we converted 93% of our EBITDA to free cash flow, which is just an unbelievable amount.\nFinancial policy, people have asked us, what you\u2019re going to use all that cash for. It\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s the same policy we had in place before the special dividend, but effectively we\u2019re going to use it to pay down debt. We de-levered this company dramatically, when the company was down as an LVO, it was about seven times back in 2006, net debt-to-EBITDA.\nWe brought that down to, when we did the IPO at the time that was February 2010, we were about 4.5 times. And prior to the special dividend after Q1, we\u2019re about 2.3 times. So we looked at, our leverage ratio at that point so that we could handle, this company can certainly handle more leverage given the free cash flow profile of the company, and so we \u2013 that\u2019s when we decided to use special dividend.\nBut going forward, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on debt pay down again, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the business both organically if we find bolt-on acquisitions that make sense, we\u2019re investing that as well. And also at some point, we may decide to return capital to shareholder again, once we\u2019ve kind of gone through those priorities in terms of the order there that I\u2019ve just listed out.\nI listed the investment highlights for you. So, I think at this point if there a few questions, we\u2019ve got some time left to take questions.\n \nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch \nI\u2019ll ask the first question. Can you comment on the impact of power outages in the Mid-Atlantic in July and your orders through the third quarter? And how do you think recent high hurricane activity in the south impacts your backlog for the rest of the year?\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\nSure. So it\u2019s a good question. Obviously, we give guidance, as we still give annual guidance. We started the year, we gave guidance. We always give guidance without major events because what that should mean is only upside for investors. If we execute on our strategy and we meet our guidance and frankly outages are going to happen, outages happens everyday, and there\u2019s 250,000 people in the U.S. everyday without power.\nThunderstorm is rolling through the Boston area this morning. We\u2019ve got thunderstorms back home in Milwaukee. 250,000 people in this country are without power everyday. That\u2019s what drives the category. What drives awareness and increase of the adoption rate at certain points in the curve are major events, right, widespread power outages where millions of people are impacted.\nThis event that, Andrew you\u2019re referring to at the end of June, is derecho event, it\u2019s straight line windstorm that went all the way from Indiana stretching through to the Mid-Atlantic region, left 3.5 million people without power. Certainly, it\u2019s an area of the country where they\u2019ve experienced some power quality issues on the Eastern seaboard in the past.\nThe more events that you have and the more times that you\u2019re without power at home, the more you start to get, frankly, you get upset about it. You don\u2019t know who to be upset at, you want to be upset at the utility company, you want to be upset at Mother Nature, but effectively, you start to realize that the problem is not going away. The grid continues to age, they\u2019re under-investing in the grid dramatically, you\u2019re on your own, so people turn to our type of product for relief to that situation. And so, we\u2019ll see increased adoption rates for home standby generators in the next two to four quarters as a result of that derecho event.\nNow the event, the hurricane that just came through Isaac, down in New Orleans, lesser event, only about 1 million people, I know it\u2019s not lesser from a flooding standpoint for the people who are impacted by the storm, but from a power outage standpoint, quite a bit smaller event. Louisiana has been impacted from time again only going back to hurricane Katrina and Wilma and some other storms have impacted that region of the country. They\u2019re frankly they\u2019re used to power quality issues as it relates to weather. So we have a very good distribution base down in that part of the country.\nSo we would expect there to be a nominal lift coming out of a region like that. And again, those are the types of events, those kind of major outage events that were not in our original guidance. So, again, outages are good for our business. We have not given specific guidance for Q3 and Q4 other than to say that we\u2019ve raised our guidance for the entire year. We did raise that guidance after that derecho event. So that was in our math when we did that, but obviously that was before the last event that happened with Hurricane Isaac. Other questions? Get to lunch.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch \nWell, I\u2019ll ask a question\u2026\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\nGo ahead.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch \nOn the industrial side.\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\nYeah.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch \nOne of the concerns that we\u2019re seeing in the industrial space is sort of order activity, total order activities coming to a slowdown, I think we\u2019re going to the election. What are you seeing in your business and do you think we\u2019re going to see a pickup after the election?\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\nYeah, some of the comments in our public comments around the C&I business have been exactly that is that we believe that there is a law that\u2019s taking place here ahead of the election. This is the same malice we get into, that businesses get into ahead of every four years here in terms of the uncertainty that comes from what the next administration may want to focus on after the election.\nOur order rates, we\u2019ve seen as we said on the C&I side, we have seen some tampering of the enthusiasm around investment, in particular in the oil and gas space. I think it\u2019s been, there has been somewhat of a pullback there. So some of the products that we ship into those markets related to the Magnum business, we\u2019ve seen some pullback. But offsetting that, the shift to natural gas, right, the sets that are still being sold out there, there are more sets being sold that are natural gas than diesel, which is favoring us. So, we\u2019re actually offsetting some of that with the shift towards natural gas.\nAnd so, and as you\u2019ve gotten some of these major outage events as well when you go back to, you guys go back to Hurricane Irene last fall out here in Milwaukee, and you go back to the early snowstorm that struck this part of the country, you\u2019ve actually got quite a few businesses that when they got in their planning cycle for 2012, they decided that they needed to add a generator and they\u2019re starting to get into that type of a phase right now where they\u2019re putting those products on. So I think that\u2019s offsetting for us.\nOften times, we see this business somewhat decoupled from the general economic environment and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve said before and something we believe happens when you get the economic cycles, we\u2019re not as intrude with those cycles maybe as other businesses, other traditional equipment businesses would be.\nAndrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nI don\u2019t want to stand between anybody and their lunch so\u2026\nAaron P. Jagdfeld\nI don\u2019t either, so we will see those light and then we\u2019ll turn you guys over to lunch hour. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.\n\n",

Duke?\nEarl Austin\nThanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings conference call. On the call, I\u2019ll provide operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, who\u2019ll provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and 2019 guidance. Following Derrick\u2019s comments, we welcome your questions.\n2018 was another strong year for Quanta. We\u2019re pleased with our results and strategic position in the marketplace. We believe our investments in craft-skilled labor and our strategy to strengthen our base business model over the last several years will continue to distinguish Quanta in the utility, energy and communications infrastructure industries.\nUpon transitioning into the CEO role in March of 2016, our five-year plan to create shareholder value, including \u2013 included the following key elements: focus on the base business to increase earnings stability; improve margins in each segment; generate $1 billion of repeatable and sustainable adjusted EBITDA; provide solutions to our customers through deep collaboration; and create growth platforms through service line expansion in the utility, industrial and communication industries.\nWe have grown revenues considerably over the last three years, but more importantly, we have increased profits faster than revenues during that time and improved our return on invested capital. Many of the goals we accomplished in 2018 move us well down the path of achieving our five-year goals.\nOur accomplishments in 2018 include; we increased EBITDA by 27%, surpassing $900 million for the first time in Quanta\u2019s history. We ended the year with record backlog of approximately $12.3 billion, which includes record 12-month and total backlog for our Electric Power segment. This is noteworthy and demonstrates the strength of our core operations considering we burned off significant backlog from the Fort McMurray West Electric Transmission Project in 2018, the largest project in Quanta\u2019s history.\nWe continue to lead the industry in safety, which we believe starts with training. We incrementally invested in our training efforts with the acquisition of Northwest Lineman College, or NLC. Since acquiring the College, we have complement their Lineman curriculum with new communications infrastructure and natural gas distribution services curriculum, which is allowing us to get employees out to the field faster and to be more productive when they get there.\nIn 2018, NLC and Quanta staff trained more than 5,000 Quanta employees to various programs. We believe our industry-leading training and recruiting initiatives will ensure that we have the very best craft-skilled labor and enhance our ability to collaborate with our customers on future workforce needs. This further differentiates us in the marketplace as a strategic solutions provider.\nIn response to several major severe weather events in 2018 and wildfires in California, we deployed more than 5,500 line workers to support and assist multiple customers\u2019 power restoration efforts. We continue to focus on positioning our base business for long-term profitable growth, as evidenced by the 21% growth in master service agreement, or MSA revenues in 2018. We accomplished this through new program agreements, increased MSA share and service line expansions with many existing customers.\nWe ended 2018 with communications backlog of approximately $760 million, a 20% increase from 2017. Our U.S. communications operations added 13 new customers, which more than doubled our U.S. customer count from prior year, and we also increased our penetration with a number of large communication providers. We believe several project and MSA opportunities could materialize in the near-term that could meaningfully increase our communications backlog.\nImportantly, our U.S. communications operations significantly improved their profitability in the fourth quarter, and we expect them to grow both top and bottom line results in 2019.\nMan-hours worked increased 18% in 2018 to record levels, and we ended the year with 39,200 employees, an increase of approximately 20% over year-end 2017. This is indicative of a strong level \u2013 levels of activity in our end markets and demand for Quanta solutions, which provide world-class execution and cost certainty for our customers\u2019 maintenance and capital programs. And we demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and our confidence in Quanta\u2019s prospects by acquiring $451 million of common stock in 2018 and declaring an initial quarterly common stock dividend, the first in Quanta\u2019s history.\nThese are just some of our accomplishments in 2018 that put us on track to achieve our long \u2013 longer-term goals. While we are proud of these achievements, we remain focused on getting better. We continue to believe there is opportunity to create significant stockholder value, as we execute on our strategic initiatives, which include continued margin expansion, adjusted EBITDA growth and improved return on invested capital.\nQuanta\u2019s end markets remain highly active, as evidenced by the double-digit revenue growth in both our segments in 2018, and we continue to believe we\u2019re in a multi-year growth cycle. While larger projects capture the headlines and generate excitement, it is the smaller projects, maintenance services and everyday work that is driving much of our growth. We estimate this type of work grew more than 20% and accounted for approximately 80% of our revenues in 2018.\nLooking forward, we expect this activity to remain robust and currently accounts for approximately 90% of our revenue guidance in 2019, demonstrating the strength of our base business foundation.\nWe operate in a variety of large addressable markets. And in the aggregate, these markets account for more than $100 billion in annual spend. We believe opportunities within our end markets could grow CapEx and OpEx spending at a mid single-digit compound annual growth rate over the medium-term, with opportunity for double-digit growth rate in some periods.\nThe traditional electric utility model has evolved over the past 20 years for many of our longstanding customers from being heavily focused on fossil fuel-based electric power generation to an advanced integrated utility model, with a heavy focus on electric transmission and distribution investment, an increasing focus on gas distribution, as well as increasing ownership of pipeline infrastructure.\nQuanta has strategically evolved this business over time to meet these evolving customer needs. This has allowed us to collaborate with our customers and create unique solutions throughout the value chain that benefit the end users.\nOur utility customers continue to deploy capital in multi-year electric and gas transmission and distribution programs for grid modernization and reliability. Our utility customers are accommodating a changing fuel generation mix towards natural gas and renewables, replacing aging infrastructure, strengthening systems for resiliency and support long-term \u2013 and to support long-term economic growth. These programs are multi-decade modernization initiatives intended to create robust and reliable delivery systems for the future.\nFor example, Duke Energy has a $37 billion capital plan for 2019 through 2023. Of that, 64% is allocated to electric transmission and distribution \u2013 gas distribution and integrity and midstream gas infrastructure, all core Quanta solutions. FirstEnergy's capital plan calls for approximately $2.8 billion of electric transmission and distribution investments per year through 2021.\nDominion Energy plans to invest $800 million per year in the electric transmission, has a $3 billion, three-year grid modernization plan and a $2 billion multi-year strategic power infrastructure underground plan. Further, they expect to invest up to $600 million per year over the next several years for pipeline replacement and transmission pipeline modernization. All three of these utilities are meaningful Quanta customers, and we believe are representative of the multi-year investment programs across the utility industry.\nAdditionally, over the past several years, devastating wildfires in California and hurricanes hitting the Gulf and East Coast have caused significant damage to property and life. These significant weather events have spurred our customers, state lawmakers and regulators to enhance the resiliency of the electric grid.\nFor example, later this month, the three major California utilities filed their 2019 wildfire safety plans, which detailed approximately $4 billion of incremental strategic investments aimed at reducing fire risk and preventing future wildfires in the state.\nQuanta is embedded in the fabric of the North American utility industry and an important resource supporting our customers\u2019 efforts to execute capital programs that are designed to benefit the ratepayer. These dynamics should provide Quanta with a transparent and large regulated end market that is growing and is resilient to economic uncertainty. It is important to note that more than 60% of Quanta\u2019s revenues is directly tied to regulated electric and gas utility customers, which is core to our business.\nWithin our Electric Power segment, our communications operations ended the year on a strong note, which contributed to revenues growth more than 50% in 2018, as compared to the prior year, led by our U.S. operations. We expect our communications operations to generate approximately $500 million in revenue in 2019, with mid single-digit operating income margins on a full-year basis.\nWe continue to believe we have the opportunity to operate our communications business with a double-digit margin profile over time, as we continue to scale our operations.\nYou have \u2013 you may have noticed in our earnings release this morning that we have renamed our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment to Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services. We believe the new name better represents the work we do within the segment and diversity of our service offerings.\nOur Pipeline and Industrial operations grew strongly in 2018, driven by base business activity in our natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity and industrial services operations, as well as significantly greater larger pipeline project activity. As we have discussed previously, we continue to optimize the segment and remain focused on improving its margin profile.\nFurthering these objectives, we have taken steps to exit certain oil-influenced operations and assets, which we believe is largely complete and will have a favorable impact on margins going forward.\nOur gas distribution integrity operations expanded our margins in 2018, as organic investments during the prior year began to payoff. Further, our industrial services group had a record year in 2018, and is well-positioned for another record year in 2019 and beyond.\nWe anticipate activity levels for our larger pipeline project market to remain elevated for at least the next few years. As pipelines are required to move, the record volumes of hydrocarbons being produced throughout North America to demand locations. Additionally, the potential for LNG export could extend the pipeline cycle, as LNG facilities are the largest consumers of natural gas and many would require new pipelines to feed their facilities.\nHowever, at times, pipelines can face challenges, for instance. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project, or ACP, has been halted for the past several months due to permitting issues. The project owners are confident that these permitting issues will be resolved.\nHowever, at this time, we are not certain as to when the project may resume construction. As a result, other than the limited amount of work that we believe will be performed on the project this year, we have elected to exclude it from our 2019 guidance.\nWe expect larger pipeline projects to account for less than 10% of our 2019 consolidated revenue guidance, and we do not need any additional larger pipeline project awards to achieve our guidance. That said, we are actively bidding and negotiating a meaningful number of other larger pipeline projects throughout North America.\nQuanta has strategically focused on diversifying its operations across service lines and geographies in a very deliberate manner. This approach is designed to help mitigate many aspects of risk in our business, including customer, labor, project, permitting, geography, execution, weather and other risks.\nI believe Quanta\u2019s diversity, scope and scale and execution capabilities are unique in our space and set us apart, both operationally and as an investment. We believe our portfolio companies, services and geographic diversity position us to profitably grow through various cycles over time.\nIn our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2019 guidance. We want to highlight a few items when comparing 2018 to 2019, which we believe demonstrate the strength of our base business and long-term strategy.\nQuanta\u2019s 2019 guidance includes a little more than $1 billion of larger project revenues versus the more than $2 billion from larger project revenues performed in 2018. This indicates the expectation for our total base business to grow by double digits in 2019. Additionally, we continue to see in excess of $6 billion in aggregate larger electric transmission and pipeline project opportunities.\nWe self-performed more than 80% of our 2018 revenue and expect to self-perform a greater percentage of our revenue this year. With our strong execution capabilities, we believe our ability to self-perform a high percentage of our work mitigates execution risk and continues to differentiate us from peers.\nAlso worth noting, it is the first time the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance range has exceeded $3. We believe our 2019 expectations also demonstrate favorable end market trends, the impact of strategic initiatives, the strength of our operations, our ability to safely execute and our strong competitive position in the marketplace.\nAs we typically do at the beginning of the year, we have taken a prudent approach to the revenue and margin ranges in our guidance to reflect what we believe are possible outcomes based on the risk inherent in our business. As the year progresses and we gain better visibility in our performance, project timing and industry dynamics, we anticipate being able to refine our expectations.\nIn summary, Quanta performed well operationally against our strategic plan in 2018, which yielded record results. Our end markets and visibility are strengthening, and we continue to believe we are in a multi-year upcycle with the opportunity for continued record backlog and results in 2019.\nWe expect our base business to continue to grow. We see opportunities for larger electric transmission and pipeline project opportunities to materialize over the coming quarters. There are continued opportunities for multi-year alliance programs over the near and medium-term, and we expect robust growth from our communications infrastructure services operations with improved profitability.\nWe are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta\u2019s base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers.\nWe believe Quanta\u2019s diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset is the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our fourth quarter results and 2019 guidance. Derrick?\nDerrick Jensen\nThanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record revenues of $3.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, a 25.6% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to common stock was $56.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to $113.6 million, or $0.72 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was a record $0.96 for the fourth quarter of 2018, as compared to $0.45 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Certain items impacted the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 and were reflected as adjustments in Quanta\u2019s adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock calculation, which I\u2019ll discuss throughout my remarks.\nDiscussing our segment results. Electric power revenues increased 5.4% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 to a record $1.66 billion. This increase was primarily due to increased customer spending aided by approximately $40 million in revenues from acquired businesses, $24 million of incremental emergency restoration service revenues and approximately $14 million of increased communication infrastructure services revenues.\nOperating margin in the Electric Power segment was 9.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018, which is relatively comparable to the fourth quarter of 2017. Our communications operations are included within our Electric Power segment and notably, the U.S. portion of these operations generated its first quarterly profit.\nOn an annual basis, the Electric Power segment grew almost 15% for the year, with revenues at a record $6.4 billion and operating income grew over $110 million, or 21% to a record $628 million. Without the dilution from our communications operations, electric power revenues generated margins in excess of 10% for the year.\nOur Pipeline and Industrial segment revenues increased 61%, when compared to the fourth quarter 2017 to a record $1.45 billion in 4Q 2018, with the most significant contribution coming from higher revenues related to larger pipeline projects due to the timing of projects.\nAlso contributing to the increase was continued growth in our gas distribution services, which have had steady growth throughout the year. Finally, industrial services experienced another quarter of strong growth, although, in part, due to the negative impact of Hurricane Harvey in the fourth quarter 2017.\nOperating margin increased to 3.7% in 4Q 2018, which excluding the impact of the asset impairment charge that negatively impacted the segment by 340 basis points, would have been 7.1%. This compares to 2.1% in 4Q 2017. As Duke mentioned in his comments, we have taken actions to exit certain oil-influenced operations and assets and as a result, we recorded asset impairment charges of $49 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.\nThis charge offsets the otherwise strong performance across the segment. Compared to 4Q 2017, overall higher segment revenues also favorably impacted margins, as it improved fixed cost absorption in the segment.\nCorporate and non-allocated costs decreased $54 million in the fourth quarter 2018, as compared to 4Q 2017, primarily due to $58 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recognized during 2017, which were partially offset by $2.3 million in higher intangible amortization during 2018.\nWith the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, we initially recorded the tax benefit of $70 million, or $0.44 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2017. Subsequent regulations and interpretations have been issued during 2018, which further adjusted the tax treatment of certain items.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a net tax charges of $36 million, or $0.24 per share, primarily related to reserves taken on previously recognized foreign tax credits in response to the new regulations. The fourth quarter 2018 free cash flow was approximately $80 million.\nFor the full-year 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities were $359 million, net capital expenditures were $261 million, resulting in free class flow of $98 million, compared to $152 million of free cash flow in 2017. This decrease was largely due to higher working capital requirements, driven by the increase in 2018 revenues, particularly the increased activity in 4Q 2018, when compared to 4Q 2017.\nDSO was 74 days at year-end 2018, down from 78 days as of the end of the third quarter, which positively contributed to the fourth quarter cash flows and was improved from 76 days at year-end 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased $234 million of outstanding common stock in the open market, acquiring 7.7 million shares. With these repurchases, we acquired a total of 13.9 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $451 million during 2018. We had approximately $299 million of availability remaining on our $500 million stock repurchase authorization at December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share, demonstrating our continued confidence and stability of our base business, long-term growth prospect and commitment to enhancing shareholder value. The first cash dividends totaling $5.8 million were paid in January 2019. At December 31, 2018, we had $1.2 billion in total liquidity.\nWe ended the year with a debt to EBITDA ratio as calculated under our senior secured credit agreement of approximately 1.6 times, which we believe is prudent in order to support the working capital demands of our growing business and allow us to continue to pursue opportunistic deployments of capital for acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and cash dividend payments.\nBefore I turn to backlog and our guidance for 2019, I\u2019d like to pause and provide an update on a key customer relationship. As many of you are aware, PG&E, one of our larger customers, filed for bankruptcy protection on January 29, 2019. As of the bankruptcy filing date, we had receivables from PG&E totaling approximately $150 million.\nAs a key partner to PG&E, we have continued to support them with services that we believe are important to the safety and reliability of their systems. We are monitoring the bankruptcy proceeding and maintaining communications with PG&E management regarding the treatment of our pre-petition receivables, as well as their need for our services going forward.\nWe currently believe we will ultimately collect our pre-petition receivables. However, as with any bankruptcy, that belief is based on a number of assumptions that are potentially subject to change as the case progresses and therefore, our assessment of collectability could change in the future. We also believe that PG&E will have sufficient debtor-in-possession financing to fund its ongoing operations and therefore, are confident we will be paid for our post-petition services in the ordinary course.\nTurning to backlog and our guidance for 2019. As of December 31, 2018, our aggregate total remaining performance obligations were estimated to be approximately $4.7 billion, approximately 66% of which is expected to be recognized in the first 12 months. Our aggregate total backlog as of December 31, 2018 was a record $12.3 billion and 12-month backlog was $7 billion.\nThese represent increases of 10.4% and 8.2%, respectively, over the prior year and reflect the continued strength of our end markets and opportunities and specifically, the continued growth of our base business, which Duke referenced in his comments.\nFor the Electric Power segment, 12-month backlog was $4.6 billion and total backlog for the segment was $8.5 billion, both represent records with increases of 13% and 16%, respectively, when compared to 4Q 2017. 12-month backlog for the Pipeline and Industrial segment was $2.4 billion and total backlog was $3.8 billion, slightly decreasing from December 31, 2017.\nTurning to guidance. For the full-year 2019, consolidated revenues are expected to range between $10.8 billion and $11.2 billion. Our range of revenue guidance contemplates Electric Power segment revenues of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion, which reflects our confidence in the continued momentum in our electric power and communications operations and particularly our base business.\nOf note, this represents segment revenue growth over 2018, which included a full-year of revenue contribution from construction activities on the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project, as well as above the average emergency restoration revenues of approximately $241 million.\nOur 2019 guidance contemplates a much lower contribution of larger project revenues and approximately $100 million of emergency restoration revenues, in line with historical averages. As it relates to seasonality within the Electric Power segment, we expect revenue growth in each quarter of 2019, compared to 2018, with quarter-over-quarter growth in the second quarter potentially exceeding 10%.\nWe expect growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, partially due to the higher levels of emergency response services in 2018. We expect the high-end of our revenue range to represent greater revenue growth opportunities in the third and fourth quarters relative to 2018.\nWe see 2019 operating margins for the Electric Power segment to be between 9.5% and 10%. We expect that seasonal effect on margins will be comparable to 2018, but first quarter operating margins expected to be the lowest for the year, growing in the second and third quarters and then experiencing a slight decline in the fourth quarter.\nAlthough the high-end of our full-year Electric Power segment expectations contemplate double-digit margins, our communications operations continue to ramp slightly diluting margins in the segment. However, we believe communications operating income margins could exceed 6% for the year and reach upper single digits on a quarterly basis by the end of the year.\nPipeline and Industrial revenues are expected to range between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion. We see double-digit quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the first quarter, with revenues growing sequentially through the third quarter. Revenues as compared to 2018 are expected to be lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis for the second, third and fourth quarters, with fourth quarter revenues potentially declining over 30% relative to 2018.\nAfter two years, much larger pipeline projects contributed to $1.5 billion in revenues, our range contemplates a significantly lower contribution from larger projects, reflecting the impact of project delays on the previously announced large diameter pipeline project award, which Duke discussed in his prepared comments.\nThe midpoint of our guidance for larger project work includes approximately $850 million of signed or verbally awarded work, the lowest levels we\u2019ve experienced since 2015. While our ability to deliver on larger projects remains a strategic differentiator, we expect base business growth to partially offset this decline, as demand for our services in the gas utility and industrial markets continues to provide meaningful growth opportunities.\nOf particular note, our 2019 guidance requires no additional larger project awards in excess of the $850 million, I previously referenced, and contemplates base business revenues at a level 75% higher than comparable revenues in 2015. Overall, Pipeline and Industrial segment operating margins are expected to improve over 2018 and be between 5.5% and 6.5%.\nAs we have discussed in years past, our first quarter traditionally has lower activity in our gas distribution business due to weather seasonality, which impacts our revenues and pressures margins. We expect margins will improve into the second and third quarters, but the decline in revenues and normal seasonality will cause margins to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter.\nWe anticipate net interest expense to be approximately $42 million for 2019. As we have previously discussed, our other expense and income line includes the deferral of a portion of the profit on construction activity for projects in which we have an ownership interest.\nIn the first-half of 2019, the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project is expected to be completed and placed in commercial operations. And at that time, we will recognize the deferred profit that has been recognized as a component of other expense in both 2018 and 2017.\nWe currently believe this may happen at the end of the first quarter. Although this reversal will not contribute to operating income or EBITDA in 2019, as it has been included in our operating results in prior years, it will positively impact our earnings per share.\nWe estimate the recognition of approximately $60 million of previously deferred profit into other income this year or the equivalent of $0.30 in diluted earnings per share. Overall, we expect other income for the year to range between $60 to $65 million.\nOne more added bit of discussion for further color in evaluating year-over-year adjusted EPS growth. This diluted earnings per share contribution could be viewed operationally as $0.24 of diluted earnings per share related to profit deferred from 2018 and $0.05 of diluted earnings per share related to profit deferred from 2017.\nWe are currently projecting our effective tax rate for 2019 to be 29.5% \u2013 to be between 29.5% and 30% for the year, with the first quarter rate being as low as 29.2%, due to the tax effect to stock-based compensation, the majority of which impacts the first quarter.\nThese operating ranges support our expectation for net income attributable to common stock of $407 million to $473 million and adjusted EBITDA between $875 million and $975 million for the full-year 2019.\nFor purposes of calculated diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2019, we are assuming around 147.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. We estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $2.76 and $3.21 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $3.30 and $3.75.\nWe estimate our capital expenditures for the year to be between $260 million and $275 million. With revenues at the midpoint of our guidance leveling off after years of substantial growth due to the timing of larger projects and the corresponding reduction in investments and working capital, free cash flow for 2019 could be meaningfully improved from prior years.\nOver the last three years, due largely to annual revenue growth in excess of 10%, our cash conversion ratio and non-GAAP measure or free cash flow divided by adjusted EBITDA averaged around 20%. In 2019, we could see free cash flow growing to between $300 million and $500 million, or cash conversion ratio of up to 50%. However, similar to prior years, the addition of incremental awards or higher levels of revenue growth than currently forecasted could put pressure on our free cash flow expectations.\nAs we close out 2018 and look ahead to 2019, I believe both years stand out. 2018 set records every quarter and ended with 18% revenue growth, 27% adjusted EBITDA growth and 43% adjusted EPS growth, a level of performance delivered by our employees that we believe deserves special recognition.\nLike the records for the year, the number of highlights are too numerous to mention, but include double-digit growth in both segments and base business activity, continued strong execution on the largest project in company history, margin increases in all major segment areas, and industry-leading expansion and safety and training efforts, all with the capital capacity and allocation backdrop of the expansion of our available credit by almost $800 million, the repurchase of $451 million in common stock, the acquisition of four companies for $146 million in total consideration and the initiation of a dividend, all while maintaining a well-positioned financial profile, a fitting year to celebrate our 20th-year of operations.\nAlthough 2018 was an exceptional year of record performance across our operations, I believe 2019 could be the most significant year in our history. One of our primary focus is, as we embarked on our strategic plan at the beginning of 2016, was to grow the base business and establish a more repeatable and sustainable EBITDA.\nAs we have commented throughout our prepared remarks, with the push of various projects from 2019 to 2020, the roll out of significant projects and the decline in strong response revenues, we head into 2019 with over $1 billion of revenue headwinds. Despite that, our 2019 adjusted EBITDA expectations show an increase at the midpoint of our guidance and importantly, imply adjusted EBITDA growth of almost $400 million from the start of our strategic plan.\nAdditionally, we expect almost 90% of our revenues this year to come from what we consider to be a base business, the highest percentage in a decade, which would represent a $3.5 billion base business revenue increase from the start of our strategic plan.\nOur goal has been to capitalize on the revenue growth opportunities within the business and have that translate into increased value to shareholders through margin expansion and capital allocation initiatives. At the midpoint of our expectations for 2019, our revenues will have grown at a 10% compound annual growth rate since 2015. More importantly, during the same period, our adjusted EBITDA will have grown at over a 15% CAGR and our adjusted EPS will have grown at well over a 30% CAGR.\nAs 2019 kicks off our third decade of operations, I believe represents a type of year that Quanta was originally founded for 20 years ago and establishes a new base against we can measure ourselves.\nThis concludes our formal presentation. And we\u2019ll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Alan Fleming with Citi. Pleased proceed with your question.\nAlan Fleming\nHI, good morning, guys. Duke, you talked about, obviously, lower levels of large diameter pipeline in 2019, $850 million lowest level since 2015. Maybe you can just talk about your confidence that this is only a low \u2013 temporary low in the current up-cycle and not a kind of cooling off of that cycle? And and maybe your visibility on the large diameter side and opportunities to redeploy some of the available capacity that you had for Atlantic Coast, both in 2019 and 2020, how are you thinking about that?\nEarl Austin\nYes, thank you. I think when we look at the segment itself and what we have this year, we\u2019re confident the $850 million, we don\u2019t need any extra awards to achieve our midpoint of our guidance. We\u2019re looking at the company and the portfolio. We\u2019re also looking at the segment with our large diameter pipe becoming less and less of that segment. It\u2019s more steady. It\u2019s less risk and we continue to perform underneath the large diameter pipe. And saying that, the opportunities are still there.\nWe talked about $6 billion in total for both electric and gas. We continue to see opportunities this year and into the future. By no means that we think we\u2019re at the bottom of the cycle, but it will cycle. It is a cyclical business in large diameter pipe. We continue to make that less of that segment over time and we\u2019re growing underneath quite nicely.\nWe\u2019re real proud of where the segment sits. The opportunities are still there. We talked about the LNG exports. We talked about moving gas and \u2013 of the Permian down into the load centers. So there\u2019s plenty of opportunity out there and there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to backfill second-half of the year and on into next year. We still like that segment and still like that large diameter pipe business.\nAlan Fleming\nOkay. And Derrick, maybe you can help us with some of the puts and takes on the margin guidance in electric power and business is growing, but the midpoint of your margin guidance is kind of flattish year-over-year. So is there anyway to kind of quantify the impact you\u2019re seeing from lower levels of large project work and less storm work and then the drag from communications that is continuing to grow? And besides operating leverage, is \u2013 are there any positive offset that are helping you to absorb some of those headwinds?\nDerrick Jensen\nYes, broadly, I mean, when you look through the communications dilution into 2019, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that we so look at the Electric Power segment to have the ability to operate at a double-digit margin. That\u2019s our target margin percentage. At the midpoint of the guidance right now, the electric power as a standalone is operating at double-digit margins, which considering the contribution that we\u2019ve had from the large project here in 2018 that contributed being able to get to that performance.\nWe\u2019re still pleased with where that margin performance is overall coming out. We think long-term, that\u2019s the target margin. Communications providing a little bit of headwind against that in \u2013 from a segment perspective. But to that end, we still think that can ultimately operated at around a 6% margin performance with a growing level of margin contributions through the year exiting, as we\u2019ve said before, kind of in the double-digit margin profile as well.\nSo, we\u2019re \u2013 we feel like that the strength of the segment is still operating there. It\u2019s important to think that \u2013 back on the large projects side, I mean, a large project component of electric power is ultimately the smallest contribution in a decade. And so to the extent that we\u2019re able to operate at a double-digit profile of electric power. That\u2019s that base business contribution and showing that the portfolio is still ultimately able to execute.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nTahira Afzal\nHi, thank you and congrats on a very strong quarter by the way.\nEarl Austin\nThank you.\nTahira Afzal\nDuke, first question is, you talked about earlier in your prepared commentary about sort of a mid single-digit growth rate for the industry. Given what seems to be an edge that you have from all the training facilities, should be assume that should provide you an edge to really outperform the industry growth trends over, let\u2019s say, a three to five-year time horizon?\nEarl Austin\nYes, thank you. I think I was speaking to us and the industry. Look, I don\u2019t \u2013 can\u2019t comment on that, you have to look at it. But when I see it \u2013 when we see our growth patterns, we say mid to upper single digits. You can go back through the years and look at our performance and look at what we\u2019ve done based upon craft-skilled labor putting people in the field and our ability to do so.\nI like our chances to continue to grow that. We set up or to mid single digits over time. And if you\u2019re coming off, let\u2019s just call it, 90% in the base business and we\u2019re growing to mid to upper single digits. You\u2019re growing quite nicely and it\u2019s repetitive, it\u2019s resilient and we like the backdrop which is 60% of it is based upon utility spends.\nTahira Afzal\nGot it. Okay, Duke. And second question for me. It\u2019s good to hear about your conversion rate to free cash flow. If I look at some of your peers and other industries that have more of the business base driven by base load activity, which is the way you\u2019re converging. The free cash flow rates are 70%-plus, so I don\u2019t know, but this is a question for Duke or Derrick. But over time, where do you see your conversion rates going?\nDerrick Jensen\nI would just say in general \u2013 I\u2019ll let Derrick comment. But in general, with the growth that\u2019s underneath of the base upper single digits on, call it, $9 billion, it\u2019s quite a bit of growth underneath. And that\u2019s \u2013 and if you look at us, we self-perform about 85% to 90% of our business.\nSo in saying that, we derisk our business from a labor standpoint and I hear quite a bit from peers and such that they have labor issues. I don\u2019t think we have that. I think when you look at us, we execute quite nicely in our base business. So \u2013 and I\u2019ll turn the rest to Derrick.\nDerrick Jensen\nYes. And on the base business side, I mean, to the extent that we see those levels of growth. I mean, one of things that we\u2019ve always said is the high levels of growth will require a level of working capital commitment. So that base business is still you\u2019re consuming that.\nAnd then the other thing unique to 2019 is that, as we commented, we do have some pre-petition receivables that are out there that we did not forecast to be turning to cash. In 2019, we think that\u2019s conservative position, so that also weighs on the conversion rate unique to the year.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nNoelle Dilts\nHi, thanks, and again congrats on a nice quarter. first just \u2013 first on the electric side looking at the strong growth you\u2019re expecting in the base business. Could you kind of give us a feel for your thoughts on just the general trends in the underlying end markets versus what you think you may be gaining through share gain? And then if you could comment on how some of the events \u2013 expand upon how some of the events like the wildfires in California and other natural disasters are impacting how utilities are thinking about grid resilience?\nEarl Austin\nYes. Thanks, Noelle. I think if you look at the data that\u2019s out there, you\u2019ll see many of our customers are investing in both CapEx for storm hardening, which is related to wildfires storms around the Gulf Coast, East Coast. So those things continue to happen, they\u2019ve happened over time. It seems like it\u2019s more frequently \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it go both ways, where you have natural disasters that are quite prevalent for two or three years and then there\u2019s a low.\nSo, whether something we can\u2019t predict, but we do see a lot of that today. I do believe that the most of the public is willing to pay for resiliency and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing with the grid. And in general, you\u2019re also seeing different forms of generation going into renewables or natural gas. So the grid is moving around from a transmission standpoint to accept those that load on to the systems.\nAnd also the last thing I would just say is, the modernization is certainly taking place and it\u2019s broad based. It\u2019s not one customer, it\u2019s across the Board and it\u2019s necessary to have a modern system in a modern economy. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think our customers and ultimately the ratepayer benefits from the investment that\u2019s been done and continuing. I do believe we\u2019re in early cycles as well.\nNoelle Dilts\nOkay, thanks. And then you kind of touched on this a bit. But just given some of the regulatory delays in \u2013 on the large project pipeline side, pushing out some of that work. Are you seeing any kind of increased competition for small to medium type of work, as competitors or other players who may have been on some of those lines trying to fill their book?\nEarl Austin\nI think, in general, we\u2019ve really concentrated on that base and making sure that we\u2019ve grown that and really at the customer level collaborating with them. We really see us just continuing to grow that out. As far as the FERC and all the decisions that are made thereon, let\u2019s call it, MVP, ACP or whatever you would like to talk about.\nThere\u2019s plenty of opportunities underneath all that, that don\u2019t make the headlines that are $90 million or $100. It\u2019s not the big project that we tend to talk about everyday. There\u2019s lots of those out there. There\u2019s lots of opportunities for us across the Board on those projects.\nWe\u2019re pleased with where we sit, more pleased with how we\u2019re executing. And I still think it goes unnoticed that last year we had about $2 billion of large projects. In the guidance this year, there\u2019s about a $1 billion. All that is base business growth that you see into 2019 that I still think goes unnoticed.\nWe continue to talk about a very, very, very small position of what we\u2019re discussing in 2019. So I just want to reiterate, again, the growth of the company at the base level and the margins around it that are sustainable and resilient.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Cook\nHi, good morning. Duke, I guess, my first question. If I look at your oil and gas margins in 2019 compared to 2018, your guide implies they\u2019re up year-over-year, even if you add back the asset impairment charging in the fourth quarter, with significantly less mainline pipe business. So what I\u2019m trying to understand is the profitability of your base business within oil and gas?\nAnd I guess, as I think over the long-term, is there a path to get your oil and gas base business margins more comparable to what we\u2019re seeing in electric power, because your electric power margins are 10% with little large project work. So I\u2019m just wondering if oil and gas can get to electric power margins in similar base business over time? Because if that\u2019s true, that\u2019s a pretty compelling story?\nMy second question is, as I think about your 2019 guide again for electric power and oil and gas, you\u2019re not assuming much in large projects. Is there less work you need to win to achieve your guidance in 2019? And then if we do get some larger projects, can you help me understand the operating leverage we should get within each of the segments? Thank you.\nEarl Austin\nYes. Thanks, Jamie. First to address the base business and the margins, I think, as a company as a whole, we work in a portfolio and many offices are consolidated. So when we look at that and we look at the company as a whole, we stated our goal, an adjusted EBITDA of 10%, we stand by it. And saying that, obviously, the gas margins are depressed. But you can see the guide from where we ended the year at 5.4%, ended the guide at 6%. That\u2019s on less risk what we consider more sustainable margins going in.\nThat being said, we\u2019ve talked about mid to upper single digits and the base in the gas side and I still believe those are achievable. The large projects, as we \u2013 we\u2019re talking about, we need \u2013 we\u2019ve also taken a prudent approach in our guidance. We have to work through contingencies on the larger projects as well as the base. We\u2019re in seasonality of weather and such. And so we do take all this into account.\nYou don\u2019t hear us comment too much about, well, Atlantic Coast pushed or this pushed. We don\u2019t make a lot of press releases on that. It\u2019s because we work through these things and we work through our contingencies. So we do understand the risk of those types and we have taken those into account.\nAs far as the large projects this year, we have $850 million in our guidance. We feel comfortable with that. And as we go forward, there are certainly opportunities. We\u2019re bidding work everyday. We\u2019re negotiating work. I expect us to fill in on the back-half with work. We\u2019ll talk about it as we get it.\nBut again, I think, what you see is the very strength of Quanta coming together on the gas side and continuing to increase the baseline margins of the business in the gas side and ultimately, trying to achieve that adjusted EBITDA across the Board of double digits.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nChad Dillard\nHi, good morning, guys.\nEarl Austin\nGood morning, Chad.\nDerrick Jensen\nGood morning.\nChad Dillard\nGood morning. Can you give us a little more color on the guidance sensitivity relative to Atlantic Coast Pipeline? Does the low-end contemplate a full mobilization?\nEarl Austin\nI think what we said is minimal revenue and operating income there in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. I think it pushes into 2020, 2021, somewhere in there. Again, we think the project is good. It\u2019s going to go. We will defer to Dominion on timing. But as far as 2019 stands, we have very minimal revenue in it.\nDerrick Jensen\nAnd that\u2019s actually, I\u2019ll try to clarify. You\u2019ve referenced it to the low-end, and that assumption that Duke made is applicable to low, medium and high-end of our guidance for oil and gas.\nChad Dillard\nGot it. And then I also wanted to get more color on the $850 million of large pipeline for 2019. How much is fully permitted? And also how does that geographic distribution differ versus last year? Just trying to figure out if there\u2019s higher Permian concentration, and what that mean for confidence that these projects may not get delayed, or held up by regulatory issues?\nEarl Austin\nYes. We\u2019re extremely confident the $850 million either mobilized or have a high degree of likelihood of mobilizing or already on the jobs. So we\u2019re very, very confident in the $850 million guidance, and it\u2019s basically the same North American footprint.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Wittmann\nGreat. Thanks. I guess, Duke, just on the oil and gas parts of the business that you\u2019re exiting with bunch of the impairment charges. I guess a little bit of detail as to what those were and why you exited them would be helpful just so that we can understand what\u2019s kind of core today and what is \u2013 and what is not core?\nEarl Austin\nYes, sure. I think we stated all the way back to 2016, when I assumed the role as CEO that the energy-related assets and things that we do related to oil were core to us and we would continue to look for ways to exit that in a systematic way that was \u2013 that would benefit our shareholders and I think we\u2019ve done that.\nWhen we look at the assets and they are basically supporting some of the Gulf Coast operations, marine type stuff and we exited that this year. We also wrote a boat off earlier in the year, so that was some of it and this is kind of a culmination of some of that as we move forward. I believe it\u2019s largely complete and we like our portfolio going forward and like where we stand.\nAndrew Wittmann\nOkay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just my follow-up here is, just on the terms and conditions around some of the pipeline awards that you\u2019re at least looking at right now on the larger side. Clearly, there has been delays and permitting issues across the Board. We\u2019ve seen, I think, in the public markets different contract styles that are negotiating.\nUnder the ones that you\u2019re looking at right now, are you still getting \u2013 or can you talk about the level of protections that you\u2019re getting from regulatory or permit-induced stand-down, just so we can kind of evaluate the rest as those continue to fall into backlog?\nEarl Austin\nYes. I think our projects, I would say, we\u2019re not incurring cost on any of our delayed projects, it would be cost-neutral at a minimum. So we feel like we have done a nice job of protecting ourselves against permanent risk. It\u2019s a collaborative effort with their owners. We want to make sure that we\u2019re both collaborative with them. We understand the risk and we\u2019re certainly in a \u2013 discussions with them on a daily basis about those risks. So in general, we work together on trying to get things built.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Thalhimer\nHey, good morning, guys. First question I wanted to ask, what would you say is your strategy for nonunion pipeline? There\u2019s so much work in the South, down in Texas. I know you have a small subsidiary that works in that area. Just curious what your thoughts are in growing that business?\nEarl Austin\nYes, we do quite a bit of work in the Texas areas. And so we continue to look at that segment, look at the base business in the segment. I think, we\u2019re growing underneath nicely. I think when you look at us in the Permian Basin, you saw us make an investment in the Permian Basin this quarter.\nSo it gives us some more looks at different workout there. We\u2019ll continue to look at that. There\u2019s some electrification that goes on. We do have quite a bit of nonunion midstream type work down in the areas. We like the business. We\u2019re certainly opportunistic as it comes across.\nAdam Thalhimer\nOkay. And then second question in telecom. You said there was \u2013 I think it was telecom. You said there were several opportunities that were large and could get booked in. Just curious if those are in your $500 million of revenue that you\u2019re expecting from communications in 2019?\nEarl Austin\nYes. I think in general, when we look at that communications segment and the business underneath, it\u2019s not in the segment, it\u2019s on the electric segment. But in general, we see lots of opportunity out there. I want to make sure that we can get to the field and get our operating margins where they need to be. I think with all the businesses that we\u2019re looking at, the macro markets are good. We can certainly drive the top line. We\u2019re highly concentrated on driving the margins and the risk.\nSo we\u2019re looking at the margins and the risks as well as the top line. But the macro market in telecom business is good. We continue to add customers and customer base. To the extent, there were sizable awards or whichever, a lot of those things are multi-year. And so we wouldn\u2019t look at that being a large contribution necessarily to the 2019 relative to our current guidance.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Nick Amicucci with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Amicucci\nHey, guys, good morning. So quick question around kind of just looking at the recent asset sales from pipeline operators. Just curious, because you guys have spoken a lot about the core business and how you\u2019re looking to grow that. How does that affect \u2013 with these asset sales, is there a contract kind of run with the land, so to speak, or would you \u2013 would it be new negotiations that would be undertaken if those \u2013 if that \u2013 those assets were sold?\nEarl Austin\nTypically, our contracts survive any kind of sale. And normally, they need us and we\u2019ve worked on systems or with customers for a long period of time. We\u2019ve not had any issues over time with assets being sold and our contracts not moving with them, typically that happens.\nNick Amicucci\nOkay, great. And then I guess, you kind of touched upon this. When you\u2019re looking at these new types of projects? Are there a lot of \u2013 is there a lot of more Brownfield extension type of work, or is it more greenfield? And if you could kind of give us some more \u2013 I know you touched upon the LNG dynamic. I mean, are you seeing any opportunities in NGLs higher than normal or anything like that?\nEarl Austin\nYes. I think we see growth across the board and the gas side. I think those larger projects that we talked about in LNGs, they\u2019re certainly out there. We\u2019re looking at them. But the base of it is right around the utility space and the LDC business, the industrial business, critical path solutions around those things that are allowing us to grow underneath on the LNG exports and things of that nature.\nSo that\u2019s where the growth is that we\u2019re seeing. Obviously, when you put large, large projects on top of that, it looks real nice and we can do great things with it. But in general, what we\u2019re concentrated on is growing that base business in that segment.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Blake Hirschman with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nBlake Hirschman\nYes, good morning, guys. Just in light of the improving free cash flow outlook, I wanted to ask about how we should be thinking about your plans and use of cash? You\u2019ve obviously been kind of buying back some stock, initiating dividend, doing some M&A as well. So I just wanted to get an update there?\nEarl Austin\nYes, I\u2019ll let Derrick comment some. But just in general, the company has taken a position that we want to be able \u2013 we want to be flexible enough that we can lean into an acquisition, lean into our stock, our dividend or whatever it may be. So we want to make sure that we\u2019re flexible with our balance sheet. And the opportunities here in front of us, we\u2019ll certainly look at those. You\u2019ve seen us big quite aggressive in our stock buyback, which I think is paying dividends for us now. But I\u2019ll let Derrick comment on the rest of them.\nDerrick Jensen\nI mean, I think, Duke hit it. I mean, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We\u2019ll be very focused on ensuring we can lean into any of the working capital requirements associated with the business. It\u2019s always the number one priority we have. There are opportunities there. We\u2019ll ensure we\u2019re well positioned to lean into that acquisitions and investments. You see the investment as an example here in the press release today within Agua Blanca. Those type of things are things we\u2019re always mindful of, and we will ensure we have a balance sheet in a good position to be able to lean into.\nAnd then just to lay out lastly, I mean, obviously, from a capital allocation, we\u2019ve leaned into shareholder value with the stock repurchases and dividends quite heavily. And so that will continue to be part of our equation. We don\u2019t forecast that into 2019 or forward, because we look at that as being born opportunistic, but largely against the other allocation areas that we have.\nWe think the working capital, M&A and investments are long-term value creation, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Lastly, with the overall parameters of ensuring, we maintain a very strong and conservatively placed balance sheet.\nBlake Hirschman\nGot it. thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So I would like to turn the floor back to management for any additional concluding comments.\nEarl Austin\nYes, I want to thank the men and women in the field. They\u2019re performing at an extremely high level and I want to thank them. I\u2019d also like to thank you for participating in our fourth quarter and our full-year 2018 conference call. We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you, and we look forward to 2019. This concludes our call.\nOperator\nOnce again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We thank you for your participation.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Janke, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nKen Janke \nThank you, Caroline. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me in Columbus today is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of our US Operations; Jerry Jeffery, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Tohru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan, joins us from Tokyo.\nBefore we begin this morning, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. The actual results in the future could differ materially from those we discuss today. As such, we'd encourage you to look at our recent quarterly press release for some of the various risk factors that could affect our future results.\nNow, I'll turn the program over to Dan who will talk about our quarter and operations in Japan and in the United States. I'll follow up with just few financial highlights for the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Dan?\nDan Amos\nThank you, Ken. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Overall, we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter and believe we're on track for achieving our primary financial objectives for both capital levels and earnings growth this year.\nLet me begin this morning's call with a review of our insurance operations beginning with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan produced strong financial results in the first quarter. Revenue growth was in line with our expectation. In addition, our pre-tax margin continued to expand as expected, resulting in strong earnings growth for the quarter.\nWe were especially pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. In fact Aflac Japan generated the largest first quarter production in its 36 year history. Total new sales for the quarter rose 10% to 30.3 billion yen. Our first quarter sales continue to benefit from strong consumer response to the recent product introductions, effective promotions and channel expansion.\nFirst quarter medical sales were again strong, increasing 21.4% over the first quarter of 2009. Medical sales reflected the successful revision of our popular medical product ever. As you know, we promoted this revised product with the maneki-neko duck campaign, which became an overnight sensation in Japan last year. Our commercial featuring maneki-neko duck was the number one rated television ad among 2,300 ads running on the major TV stations in Japan when we first released it last year. In addition, the jingle from the commercial was the most popular cell phone download in Japan for six days in a row after it was released. Today, we have distributed approximately 1.6 million maneki-neko ducks through Japan.\nWe continue to produce strong sales in our ordinary life category. Ordinary life sales were up 64.4% in the first quarter, with the new child endowment product accounting for approximately 44% of the total ordinary life sales. We sold more than 29,900 child endowment policies in the first quarter at an average premium of 155,600 yen per policy. Although the child endowment product has a lower margin than the health products, the premium is almost three times higher than the cancer and the medical product. As such, it's a solid contributor to both the top and bottom lines. In addition, we've been able to leverage our child endowment sales through cross selling. In fact, for every 10 child endowment plans sold, our agents sold two additional policies to the same customers.\nWe also experienced strong gains in the bank channel sales in the first quarter. March was the single largest month of production from this channel and bank channel sales were a record 3.1 billion yen in the quarter. That represents 6.5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009 and a 206.6% increase over a year ago. At the end of March, a total of 352 banks represented Aflac Japan. We have a strong position within the bank channel and have significantly more bank selling for third sector products than any other insurer operating in Japan.\nWe believe our objective of a zero to 5% growth in 2010 is reasonable and our first quarter sales results are a good start toward achieving that objective. However, we do not expect second quarter sales to be as strong as the first quarter largely due to tougher comparisons. I'll remind you, for instance, that we introduced our popular child endowment product last March. As such, growth rates in the ordinary life product category for the remainder of the year will be much lower than we've produced in the last several quarters.\nIn addition, as we discussed in the fourth quarter conference call, we expect much lower sales contributions from our largest telemarketing based agency. We also expect sales from Dai-ichi Life to be down for the full year. To put this in perspective, excluding the impact from these two channels, first quarter sales rose 21.7%, yet despite these headwinds, we're encouraged by our 10% sales increase in the quarter and our prospects in Japan for this year and beyond. We continue to believe that Aflac Japan is positioned as a strongest competitor in the third sector in Japan.\nLet me turn to our US operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac US performance was in line with our expectations in the first quarter. As expected, our persistency rate was lower than a year ago. The drop in the first quarter was attributable to the significant lapses at the Wal-Mart account. Excluding the impact from that large account, persistency improved to 72.3% for the first quarter compared to 66.9% a year ago. However, as we expected when we announced the loss of the account last March, the earnings impact from the loss of the account was actually very positive in the first quarter due to the sizable release of reserves we held for the block of business.\nAs has been the case for the last several quarters, we continue to face sales challenges in the US markets. Total new annualized premium sales in the quarter were $316 million or 10% lower than a year ago. Although we weren't pleased with sales decline, we were not surprised.\nI hope you remember my comments from the fourth quarter call when I said that we expected to see a sizable decline in the first quarter sales due in part to five fewer production days in the first quarter of 2010 compared to last year. The impact on sales from fewer days was approximately $16 million. However, that was largely offset by $13 million of sales from the new Aflac Group business.\nBeyond the tough comparisons, difficult economic conditions continue to pose obstacles to sales growth. Throughout this period of economic weakness, our veteran agents in particular have faced very challenging reenrollment conditions. Because many businesses have reduced staffing, it's common for our sales associates to see fewer employees during reenrollment, and employees they do see are likely to be more cautious about spending.\nThe impact from the sales through veteran agents is meaningful because approximately 70% of our total US sales come from agents who have been with us more than one year. Remember too that approximately 90% of the businesses we sell through have fewer than 100 workers. Clearly, small businesses have been especially vulnerable in the current economy.\nHistorically, we've been able to offset some of the impact of the weak economy through better recruiting. You may recall that recruiting was up an incredibly 25% to 8,100 new agents in the first quarter of last year, which was our largest number of recruits in a single quarter. Our record recruiting a year ago coincides with a major Internet recruiting campaign and some massive layoff at large employers, which gave us a unique opportunity to recruit. Against that tough comparison, recruiting in the first quarter was relatively weak with 5,900 new recruits. However, on a sequential basis, first quarter recruiting was up 6.9% than the fourth quarter.\nIn addition to tough comparisons, we experienced some contraction in the number of sales coordinators, which has reduced our recruiting capacity. A portion of the coordinator reduction was strategic consolidation and some was through attrition. We are currently evaluating our coordinator level to determine where we might need to rebuild. We've also changed the bonus structure for our state and regional coordinators from one that was based entirely on sales to a structure including people development.\nThe comparison to last year's second quarter will be very difficult on a year-to-year basis. We expect to see recruiting decline for the second quarter. However, we expect to see better recruiting in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.\nIn addition to expanding the size and capabilities of a traditional sales force, we are excited about the opportunities to enhance our distribution system with the addition of insurance brokers. Our efforts to build new and better relationship in the regional and large account broker market began in 2007. In 2009, we officially launched an initiative called Aflac for Brokers. We have staffed our broker department with employees who have significant experience in broker sales. Although our entry into the distribution outlet is fairly recent, we are very pleased with our results so far. As I mentioned in our last conference call, an independent survey in January of this year found that Aflac is the number one preferred carrier of voluntary insurance among brokers.\nMore importantly, our effort is translating into sales. In the first quarter broker sales rose 30.6% over last year. That reflected the inclusion of the new Aflac Group business in the first quarter of this year, most of which is broker distributed. However, on a pro forma basis in which Aflac Group sales were included in the first quarter results for both this year and last year, broker sales were still up 5.9%.\nYou'll recall that we acquired Continental American Insurance Company, now branded as Aflac Group Insurance, in part to better meet the product needs of our broker distribution. At the same time, however, Group product should enhance the sales opportunity for our traditional sales force of individual associates. In fact, our sales force is very enthusiastic about the new Group products. We also believe this will better position us to tap into the large payroll account market as larger businesses typically prefer Group products.\nIn Middle East, we are not only new to the Group business, we are actually playing catch up as some of our competitors been offering Group products through Group for many years. In addition, it may take some time for the Group sales to have a meaningful impact to the overall US sales growth. However, we bought a scalable platform and we expect to see strong sales growth in the Group side of our business in the future.\nIn the short term, our outlook for new sales in the United States remains cautious due primarily to the weak economy and high levels of unemployment. Earlier this year, we established a 2010 target of a zero to 5% sales growth for the US segment. We have since modified our objective to enable our US officers to earn a small bonus if the sales are flat to down 5% in the first half, but that portion can only be paid if sales are flat to up 5% in the second half. We found this two part bonus structure to be effective in motivating our management team when we used it in Japan three years ago and we hope it will have the same impact on Aflac US this year.\nAlthough I don't like the idea of paying a bonus for negative sales performance, I believe it's important to set reasonable targets. Given the circumstances, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also felt the two part bonus was appropriate for this year. I believe our objective for the second half of the year is achievable if we see improvement in employment levels of our core markets, which compromises business with fewer than 50 workers.\nIn the long run, our outlook for Aflac US has not changed. We continue to view the US market as underpenetrated. Furthermore, following the enactment of the healthcare reform, we believe employers and consumers will increasingly understand the need for products we offer, just as they have in Japan.\nOverall, we are pleased with Aflac's consolidated financial performance in the first quarter of this year. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.41. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per share rose 11.5% for the quarter.\nGross realized investment losses in the quarter were lower than in the fourth quarter and a year ago. However, because we generated $146 million of realized gains in the first quarter of last year to take advantage of tax loss carry-forward, net realized investment losses were higher than a year ago.\nAs we noted in last night's press release, we booked $27 million of GAAP-only impairments on two perpetual securities using the equity impairment method. These impairments resulted from rating deterioration of these securities. As we repeatedly discussed, we are required by GAAP accounting to apply an aging schedule of unrealized losses to the perpetual securities that are classified as below investment grade.\nOur business continued to generate significant capital in the first quarter. Although we've not yet completed our statutory financials statement, we estimate that our risk based capital ratio was in excess of 525% at the end of March. Maintaining the strong RBC ratio remains a priority for us. Like last year, it's an important component of our management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our official objective for this year is to maintain the ratio range of 375% to 475%. However we plan to work towards finishing 2010 with a higher RBC ratio than year end 2009 ratio of 479%.\nI realized that many of you have asked when we feel comfortable deploying capital again. As I noted last quarter, we would like to extend our record of 27 consecutive annual increases in the cash dividend to 28 and beyond. If the credit markets remain relatively stable, I think it's reasonable to expect the Board to approve a dividend increase some time during the second half of the year. Over the long run, our capital generation has allowed us to maintain a policy of steadily increasing the cash dividend.\nAdditionally, we continue to believe it's appropriate to enhance shareholder value through prudent share repurchases. However, before we commit to resuming share repurchase, we will closely monitor global financial markets to make sure the worst is behind us. We will also regularly assess our capital levels and measure our RBC ratio. I think it's likely that the soonest we would consider repurchasing our shares is towards the end of this year or 2011. Our objective is to increase the cash dividend and resume share repurchase, but our greatest priority that continues is to maintain a strong capital position.\nYet, at the same time, we are still focused on the income statement. In that regard, we reaffirm the earnings outlook we previously communicated in 2010. Our goal this year is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 9% to 12% before the impact of the yen. At our upcoming Analyst Meeting, we will discuss the outlook for 2011 earnings growth.\nI remain pleased with Aflac positioned in the two best insurance markets in the world. We continue to believe Japan and the United States each have characteristics that make them perfectly suited to our products. Aflac has earned the distinction of being the best branded company for voluntary supplemental products in each country. Importantly, both markets offer opportunities for growth.\nIn pursuing our objectives for this year and beyond, it's clear that we will continue to face some challenge. However, our business is strong from an operational perspective and we have confidence in our business model and in our people. We also have to strengthen our balance sheet that will allow us to continue to fulfill the promises that we've made to the customers and the expectations of our shareholders. Ken?\nKen Janke \nThank you, Dan. Let me just take you briefly through some of the first quarter numbers, staring with Aflac Japan.\nBeginning at the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.6% for the quarter and investment income rose 2.5%. Excluding the effect of a stronger yen in Aflac Japan's dollar denominated investment income, net investment income rose 3.5% for the quarter. The annualized persistency rate, excluding the annuity business, was strong and little changed in the first quarter. The rate was 93.8% compared with 93.9% a year ago.\nIn terms of operating ratios, the benefit ratio continued to improve over the last year and was 59.5% in the first quarter versus 61.5% a year ago. The expense ratio also improved slightly at 19.1%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of '09. As a result of the lower benefit and expense ratios, pre-tax margin rose from 19% to 21.4% in the quarter, and with the expansion of the margin, pre-tax operating earnings increased 16.8% for the quarter in yen terms.\nFor the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.46%. Including dollars, the blended rate was 2.67%. Although new money yields were lower due to spread compression in the purchase of higher rated securities, they were above budget for the quarter. The portfolio yield was 3.75% at the end of March, down 2 basis points from the end of December and 12 basis points lower than a year ago.\nTurning to Aflac US, total revenues rose 3.7% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio was 45.5% compared with 49.5% a year ago. The decline in the benefit ratio reflected the higher lapsation from the Wal-Mart policies in the quarter, and higher lapses also increased DAC amortization, which was up 9% versus a year ago. The operating expense ratio rose from 33.9% to 35.4%, reflecting both the higher DAC amortization as well as higher advertising expenses which were planned for the first quarter.\nThe profit margin for the quarter was 19.1% compared with 16.6% a year ago, and as we indicated in last night's press release, the margin would have been approximately 16% without the impact of the benefit reserve release related to the Wal-Mart terminations.\nIn terms of US investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.98% versus 8.67% a year ago. Like Japan, our new money yields in the US segment were ahead of budget for the quarter. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was 7.06%, down 11 basis points from the fourth quarter and 12 basis points lower than a year ago.\nTurning to some other items for the quarter, non insurance interest expense in the first quarter was $31 million compared with $7 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflected our debt issuance in 2009. Parent company and other expenses were unusually low in the first quarter of last year and rose from $9 million to $14 million in the first quarter of 2010.\nTotal company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and Aflac US As a result, the pre-tax margin rose from 18.1% to 20% and the after-tax margin increased from 11.8% to 13% in the first quarter this year. On an operating basis, the tax rate was unchanged at 34.7%.\nNet earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.35 compared with the $1.22 a year ago. Realized investment losses were $0.06 per share compared with $0.01 per share in the first quarter of 2009.\nDuring the quarter, we realized investment loss of $77 million or $0.16 per diluted share, as we noted $49 million of which came from the sale of the remaining of our holdings of Takefuji Corporation and $27 million, as Dan mentioned, came from the equity impairment method charges on two perpetuals.\nWe also realized investment gains of $47 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the quarter, $36 million resulted from the sale of securities. The remaining $11 million gain was due to the valuation of foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps has required by ASC 810, formally known as SFAS 167.\nAs we discussed on our fourth quarter call, ASC 810 eliminated the concept of qualified special purpose entities and required us to consolidate certain variable interest entities on the balance sheet. Upon adoption, we made a one time cumulative adjustment, which reduced shareholders' equity by $165 million.\nAs reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.41 and the stronger yen increased earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in the quarter.\nFinally, let me comment on the outlook for 2010. As you heard Dan say, we have affirmed our objective for 2010 of a 9% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of currency. That would equate to $5.29 to $5.43 for the full year. Assuming an exchange rate of 90 to 95 yen to the dollar, we would be at $5.24 to $5.56. If the yen average is 90 to 95 for the second quarter, we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38.\nWe'd now be happy to take your questions. And to allow time for everyone to ask questions, please try and limit your questions to one. If you have more, we'll try and get back with you. Caroline, we'd be happy to go to the Q&A now.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question or comment comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan\nI had a question on your excess capital position and ability to buy back stock, just trying to estimate the magnitudes of buyback. I think, Dan, you mentioned that you'll look at potential buyback later in 2010. Could you maybe discuss what you expect your RBC to be longer term? And just help us quantify what the size of buyback would be on an ongoing basis, like how much cushion you have versus your goal and the 525% RBC right now, then free cash flow I think it's over $1 billion each year, so just so we can get a better idea on what the magnitude of buyback could be on an ongoing basis?\nKriss Cloninger III\nWe had given some guidance in our previous FAB meeting that our modeling or EPS guidance modeling is based on share repurchase of somewhere between zero to 12 million shares, both for 2010 and 2011. We'll pretty much stick to that. We have been running share repurchase at a rate of about 12 million shares a year until 2008, and then we accelerated the share repurchase when we thought we had a significant amount of excess capital. You can argue whether or not that turned out to be the case.\nToday, we ended last year at 479%. We're in excess of 525% at the end of the first quarter. I'll say with the situation in Greece and the like in their downgrades that happened yesterday that will have some negative effect on RBC. And it just points out the need to continue to do what we said we were going to do during 2010, which was to watch the environment, to see how things stabilize, and then to make our decision towards the end of 2010, at which point we'll start to deploy excess capital. I've personally told Ken Janke I don't want to use the words excess capital in any of our press releases for the foreseeable future. If you want to quantify, I think it's pretty easy to tell a difference between them.\nThe stated RBC ratios, I would say \u2013 479% and whatever our current position is, I will say that our required capital base is about $1.2 billion, which would represent about 100 points of RBC. So, if you want to determine the difference between where we are in RBC and where you think we ought to be, based on your personal opinion, you are welcome to quantify it yourself, but I'm still avoiding using the words excess capital today.\nJimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan\nAnd maybe you could call that a capital cushion. But the reason I was asking is, if you have $1 billion above your target and you are generating $1 billion plus of free cash flow each year, if you are thinking longer term next year or the year beyond, would you let the capital just sit there, or over time if the markets are stable and the situation in Greece and everywhere else stabilizes, would you ramp-up buybacks at least to use up your free cash flow each year?\nKriss Cloninger III\nWe've said that's under active consideration.\nJimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan\nAnd then just following up, do you know what the impact on your RBC is from the Greece downgrades?\nKriss Cloninger III\nWe've done some, I'll call them, quick and dirty estimates that said that if all our investments in Greece get downgraded to an NAIC 3 category, which is basically BB, it impact us by roughly 14 RBC points. That includes (inaudible) the bank exposure.\nJimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan\nAnd just a numbers question, on your interest expense side, it was $31 million this quarter, around $25 million last couple of quarters. Is the first quarter a good run rate to use going forward?\nKriss Cloninger III\nYeah. We fully absorbed the increased interest expense for the first time in the first quarter of 2010. So, that's a good run rate. From now on, we will get a slight decrease in that run rate when we pay off our yen denominated senior notes of 40 billion yen in early July, but the interest rate on that was pretty low. So it's not going to be a material decline. Interest expense will be between 110 million, 120 million for the year.\nOperator\nOur next question or comment comes from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.\nSteven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates\nI was hoping I can hear from Mr. Tonoike about what was going on in Japan. I'm particularly interested in Kampo. My understanding is that the DPJ recently okayed Kampo to increase the life benefits that it pays outside of its policies, increased the amount of deposits it can take. And recently, I believe, there was a proposal floated to allow Japan Post Insurance to enter new markets without official approval, rather just notifying various ministries. So I was wondering what exactly was going on there with Kampo?\nDan Amos\nI asked Charles Lake to be on the call just in case we got a question. Charles is Chairman, of course, of Aflac Japan. So, Charles, would you mind addressing that?\nCharles Lake II\nLet we first say that in terms of development relating to Japan Post and Kampo, we expect a cabinet decision regarding a bill on Japan Post reform either on April 30th or May 7th, which will be followed by an introduction of that bill to the Japanese Diet or the parliament for debate after the Golden Week holidays in Japan, which is, as you know, early part of May. The cabinet decision will likely be based on the outline that was announced by the two ministers in charge of postal reform, which, as you probably know, was widely reported. It provoked opposition inside the cabinet as well as domestic and international communities.\nThe debate that will take place in the Diet will be taking place in the context of very complex political dynamics in Japan. A three party coalition headed by Democratic Party of Japan, DPJ, as you mentioned, which is about to face an Upper House election in July. And for this reason, again, many of the things that you mentioned with respect to those ideas, many policy experts on the ground in Tokyo say that it's really not clear whether this bill will actually pass the Diet by the June 16 close of the current legislative session. We are in close communication with many of the key players in the Diet, in the government, and many verify or confirm that assessment.\nSo, even if the bill does pass the Diet by June, the legislation will be lacking in detail, requiring a lot of regulatory work, with an implementation date being possibly as late as October 2011. So, accordingly \u2013 maybe will be premature to discuss a lot of things that's floating out there or rumored to be in the cabinet decision. Tohru and I have talked about this. In our view, this debate will not have an immediate material impact on our operations in Japan, and Aflac Japan is continuing to work with postal network to develop that channel. So I don't know if that helps elaborate on sort of many of the issues that are out there.\nDan Amos\nLet me say one other thing about postal is that the new product that we've been selling, the life insurance product, the child endowment, is in direct competition with the postal. And as you've seen the numbers, we have done exceptionally well. So I am encouraged how we are able to compete in a head-to-head with Post, even though I think Charles explained it better in much more detail that we are a long ways from seeing anything take place.\nSteven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates\nDan, just a follow up on that, just to make sure we are apples-to-apples here. Your child endowment policy \u2013 well, is postal ought to have the same amount of benefits that you provide?\nDan Amos\nTohru, why don't you answer that?\nTohru Tonoike\nYes. The benefit now their product is offering is not exactly the same as ours, but basically they provide the same, say, kind of the benefit. We think ours is a better product overall, but it is I would say, similar in nature.\nOperator\nOur next question or comment comes from Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nNigel Dally - Morgan Stanley\nMy question is regarding the US You mentioned some changes in compensation to include a component for people development. Can you provide some additional details regarding these changes linked to recruiting or producing agent counts, and how much of the compensation is going to be linked to this measure relative to sales?\nDan Amos\nI'll be more than happy to talk about that, Nigel. We have traditionally had bonuses at our highest levels of management focused solely on production. While that does well within a single calendar year, it is essential for us to look at the long-term viability in growth of our organizations. And we felt it was good to include not only producer growth but account growth on a net basis.\nSo there is a form of retention in there along with the production components. We feel like this is a more balanced scorecard for our people to determine what they need to be doing in the future. I will tell you that as a part of that, recruiting is not included in that. What is included is average weekly new producer growth. The reason we did that is recruiting is merely an activity of getting people. We need to make sure that those people are being more productive. That's the reason when you saw, and as Dan mentioned, on our Internet recruiting numbers, we had a high volume of recruits, 8,100 in the first quarter of last year.\nUnfortunately, the productivity from those recruits was not as high as we would like. And as such, we've refocused the attention of our regional sales coordinators and state sales coordinators to be balanced among the different channels of sourcing for recruiting, not just Internet, but also to include field nomination, the way we used to do business. And we feel like that will have a driving component behind why our average weekly new producer growth will eventually come up as recruiting comes up. And so, that's why Dan spoke of second half improvement sequentially in recruiting between the first quarter and the second quarter, and then look for improved recruiting in the second half of the year.\nNigel Dally - Morgan Stanley\nAnd Paul, what's the split between the compensation regarding the new measures of average weekly producing account versus traditional production levels?\nPaul Amos II\nYou mean the split between the two, is that what you asked?\nNigel Dally - Morgan Stanley\nYeah, exactly.\nPaul Amos II\nIt's about 50% production, 20% account growth and 30% people growth as a ballpark. I'll give you all the details if you want them when we get the FAB when I'll put that into a little more depth.\nOperator\nOur next question or comment comes from Ed Spehar from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEd Spehar - Bank of America\nKriss, one question. If you look in the last couple of years the required capital has grown at a rapid pace because of credit migration, but if you go back in prior year \u2013 so I'm talking about denominator of the RBC ratio, if you go back in prior years it wasn't growing all that rapidly. Could you give us some sense given the mix of business you have and some of your expectations for growth, how we should think about the change in required capital over time?\nKriss Cloninger III\nI think generally, Ed, the key factors are the growth of the premium income and the growth of the assets themselves. It's focused on insurance risk and it's focused on asset risk. And what's really grown over the last year or two has been the asset risk component of the thing. The insurance risk is represented by growth in premium income and the like has grown, let's say, the 5% type number on average that's represented in our core growth and top line revenues and the like. So, that's pretty much it. The two risks of insurance and asset are the two dominant factors, and the big increase in 2008 and 2009 related to the assets, not the insurance. And I think absent any more credit migrations or credit downgrades that we'll see a resumption of the more normal growth in RBC required capital associated with just the normal growth in the business.\nEd Spehar - Bank of America\nAnd just more follow up. Could you just give me again what you said the RBC impact you estimated from Greece? And when you say the total amount downgraded, could you give us what that invested asset number is because I guess it's not just the sovereign, right, you said it was banks as well?\nKriss Cloninger III\nRight. We've got around 350 or sovereign debt in Greece and around $1 billion in three banks, maybe a little less than that. Jerry, do you have\u2026\nW. Jeremy Jeffery\nIt's about $950 million in three Greek banks.\nKriss Cloninger III\nA little less. So, out of that $1.3 billion total, we're saying that if all those securities were downgraded NAIC 3, it would impact RBC negatively by about 14 points.\nEd Spehar - Bank of America\nOkay, are those mix now of NAIC 1 and 2 or they are all 1?\nKriss Cloninger III\nCorrect. Yeah, they are 1 and 2 right now.\nOperator\nOur next question or comment comes from Eric Berg from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.\nEric Berg - Barclays Capital\nMy one question relates to the US business and what specifically has to happen in the economy for employers to be more inclined to do business with you folks than they are at present? In other words, more specifically my question is, let's say the consensus view is right that unemployment remains high for the foreseeable future, call it the next couple of years unemployment, I don't know, of 8%, 9% or 10%, could your business prosper in the United States even with that high level of unemployment?\nPaul Amos II\nLet me begin, Eric, by saying that it really isn't the employer that's the issue. It is the employees and the individuals who are making choices. In fact, while our account number that we released was down, if you were to actually take out the five extra days of processing, we were up 3.7% in new account. So employers more than ever are listening to the fact that they want to put in our products they see the value in what we are doing. We continue to believe that's viable.\nAs we've talked about for a couple of years now, the other concept is that it's building shelf space because it's the employees individually who are not purchasing at the same level. And to let you know, that's true of both our existing accounts and our new accounts. It's pretty consistent, which we believe points directly to the fact that it is the account. So, to your question of what needs to happen for employers to begin hiring new people, I can't speak directly to what they are going to be doing in their individual businesses, but my hope is that this will not be a jobless recovery. Certainly, the better employment is, the stronger chance we have of continuing to sell our products, and I think stability in the economy will give people more security about spending their dollars all on insurance. Does that answer your question?\nEric Berg - Barclays Capital\nI think it does. I certainly got the message. The message is coming through loudly and clearly that it is fundamentally about what the employee thinks rather than his employer. But again, let's say, that unemployment rate remains high, could you still imagine an environment in which employees are willing more that at present to say yes? The employee I guess, I'm rephrasing my question to focus now on the employees?\nPaul Amos II\nYeah, I can absolutely imagine that. Is that something that's going to happen in the short term, I cannot predict, but we certainly are putting strategies in place that we believe will help better affect sales. One thing I can tell you on a positive note is that while the productivity of our veteran agents, which has been one of the key reasons that we've talked about things being difficult has remained down, the number of veteran agents who are producing has been steadily on the increase over the last couple of months. So, we feel like that is a slight uptick in trend that is positive. But again, it's productivity. And to your point, do I see employees eventually wanting to buy more of our insurance, I absolutely do. As Dan mentioned earlier, national healthcare is going to place an emphasis on people understanding the better value of our products. And I believe long term, just like it did in Japan, that will be a positive for us.\nOperator\nYour next question or comment comes from Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets\nActually I was going to ask a couple of Washington policy type questions. It picks up right there on what Paul was saying. On the healthcare reform, and I'm hearing you say it's a general awareness folks would have of their personal responsibilities, but are you also potentially thinking about making a product that could be designed to be sold in or around the exchanges that will be formed?\nPaul Amos II\nAs the current law exists today, our policies will not be sold through the exchanges. At this point, we have no reason to believe that that's going to change. If you look at the regulation itself, currently there is no regulation for life disability and accident, some of our largest product lines. It is the remaining products that ultimately are going to be overseen. At this point, we believe that the product development that we're doing through our distribution of both field force and the brokers represents the best opportunity for us to get to the employer, and I do not believe right now that the exchanges would be in any way used for supplemental or voluntary worksite benefits.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets\nBut is there a way that you could sell around the exchanges more directly if there are shortfalls that people get from products there?\nDan Amos\nWhether it's an exchange, whether it's an HMO, whether it's a national healthcare as in Japan or whether it's Blue Cross Blue Shield, there are still gaps that occur, and our job as sales people is to make sure that we expose those gaps, tell them where they are and how they need to be filled. And so, the answer to your question from that standpoint is, yes, we will continue to find products and services that help fill gaps that are created in the healthcare environment. Does that answer your question?\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets\nYeah, that's perfect. Thank you. And then just on the other piece of legislation, the financial reform. Through the derivatives piece of this potential legislation, and then I guess I would mention TARP tax too, any potential exposure or change that you see for Aflac's operations through that bill?\nDan Amos\nWe are following it, but we don't see any major implications for us. The so called TARP tax, it's my understanding that they are excluding financial institutional liabilities that are subject to another support fund, whether its policyholder protection fund in Japan or the state regulatory remedies in the US when insurance companies fail. So, we don't think there is a big influence on us there.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets\nAnd on the derivative side, just intuitively, if you had to purchase your derivatives instead of doing it over-the-counter, which I imagine you do now, but did it more through more transparent exchange, could that potentially save you money? Would I be thinking about the right way if I said that?\nW. Jeremy Jeffery\nI think it's important to understand that we have some derivatives on our books now as a result of accounting changes. We are not active participants in derivative markets. So I don't really see any significant impact on any derivatives reform that takes place.\nOperator\nYour next question or comment comes from Suneet Kamath from Sanford C. Bernstein. Your line is open.\nSuneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein\nI just wanted to go back, for Jerry, on the sovereign exposure. I think the Greek sovereign exposure that you mentioned earlier on the call is a little bit different from the numbers that I jotted down last night. So, if you don't mind, can you just walk through the sovereign exposure, Greece, Spain, Italy, and maybe just comments around what exactly your exposure is, is it to the government or other entities? And then related to that, I think you mentioned total Greek exposure, banks plus sovereign, is something like $1.3 billion, which, relative to your equity base, is pretty sizeable. I know we've talked on these calls about concentration restrictions and then changes that you've made to your investment philosophy there, but do you have restrictions or are you thinking about restrictions related to total country exposure, obviously excluding Japan, given that governments and financial institutions in these countries have obviously become a lot more late relative to the past?\nW. Jeremy Jeffery\nLet me start with your first one, which is what our sovereign exposures look like. Our direct sovereign exposure to Greece is \u2013 the book value is about $285 million. And we have, on a book value basis, just slightly over \u2013 very slightly over $1 billion two Greek banks. None of the Greek bank exposure is perpetual exposure by the way. As far as \u2013 I think it was Portugal one you asked about, we have no direct sovereign exposure to Portugal \u2013 have some exposure to their banking system. The total exposure to their banking system in Portugal is approximately $750 million book value. We do have some industrial exposure there as well.\nSuneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein\nSpain and Italy were the other two I mentioned.\nW. Jeremy Jeffery\nSpain, we have no sovereign, no direct sovereign exposure. Italy, we do have exposure to the Republic of Italy. Book value there is $269 million. In terms of your other question, which is, are we contemplating imposing sovereign limits \u2013 is that your question?\nSuneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein\nThat's right, exactly.\nW. Jeremy Jeffery\nI think it's a great question and I think it's one that we're looking at very carefully right now because the notion of a sovereign default by an EU country or any highly rated country was unthinkable couple of months ago. And I still don't think it's predictable as to what's going to happen with Greece, but there is enormous pressure being applied by the EU and the IMF, as we speak, and it will be instructive as to how we proceed what takes place there. But I think we learnt a lot today actually as to the course that that takes and we will respond to that.\nOperator\nYour next question or comment comes from Darin Arita from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDarin Arita - Deutsche Bank\nAs I take a look at this year's EPS growth guidance of 9% to 12%, can you talk about what the critical drivers are as we look through the balance of this year to get to the upper end of that growth range?\nKriss Cloninger III\nThe key drivers that are going to occur throughout the year are just the basics of revenue growth and margin changes. In Japan, we continue to think the revenue growth will be in line with the first quarter growth of roughly 3.5%. We think we'll have margin expansion of roughly 1.5% to 2% of revenue. We'll update you on that probably at the FAB meeting, but I think it will be in line with what we saw in the first quarter. US revenue growth, certainly the US is more impacted by the level of new sales in their revenue growth because roughly 30% of revenues come from first year of premium in the US or as in Japan it's less than 10% of first year of premium.\nSo, the US results are much sensitive to the level of new sales. We have predicted the level margin for our US business absent the impact of the Wal-Mart thing, which was totally a first quarter event. So, we estimate that our US margins would probably be relatively constant for the remainder of the year. I mentioned interest expense earlier. We fully absorb the new level of interest expense in the first quarter compared to the quarters during 2009. So the effect of increased interest expense will diminish as we go through the year. We took on our first level of new debt, the $850 million of new debt middle of May last year. We followed that with a little bit of additional yen-denominated debt in June, and of course, another measure of senior debt in December of $400 million or so. So that effect is going to diminish throughout the year.\nWe had a negative impact on EPS growth in the first quarter related to an increase in diluted shares, just associated with the increase in the share price and dilutive effect of outstanding stock options from \u2013 up until 2009 when the stock price was really depressed, we'd had roughly 6 million shares of dilution each year from, say 2005, through 2008. First quarter 2009 that dropped down from 6 million shares to about 1 million shares, and the first quarter of this year is back up to about 4.5 million shares. So, we hope to see more dilution from stock option as the stock price goes up, but that is a bit of a drag on EPS. We doubt that we'll resume share repurchase in 2010, though it is under consideration. And I previously talked about what we're looking for, for share repurchase in 2011. So, that's the big picture, Darin.\nDarin Arita - Deutsche Bank\nSo are share repurchases not necessary for 2010 to get to the 12%?\nKriss Cloninger III\nNot for 9, but\u2026\nDan Amos\nHe asked for 12.\nKriss Cloninger III\nYeah, I know about the 12. I am not sure about whether \u2013 we'd have to have some better increases in core earnings to get to the 12 I think. I'm not sure we're going to do share repurchase in time to have a material impact on 2010 EPS.\nOperator\nYour next question or comment comes from Andrew Kligerman from UBS. Your line is open.\nAndrew Kligerman - UBS\nJust some question on the US Firstly, you indicated that in order to pay bonuses out to the coordinators or I guess management in the US, sales would have to be up zero to 5% in the first half of the year. Is that correct?\nKriss Cloninger III\nSecond half.\nDan Amos\nIt will be [flawed] down 5% to up to flat, and then the second half would be flat or up 5%. But you can't get the first half if you don't get the second half. It's exactly the way we did it in Japan three years ago. So we're basically trying if we ended up being flat for the first half, we'd be thrilled. But what we want to see is a turnaround, that's what we're shooting for.\nAndrew Kligerman - UBS\nAnd I guess for these folks to do \u2013 to even make anything, then they'd have to be flat in the second quarter in order to be down 5% since you were down 10% in the first quarter. So, do you have any optimism that they could actually be flat 2Q over 2Q in the US?\nDan Amos\nLet me say just a clarification. 2Q only impacts the bonus for the first half, and that's only 25% of the total. So, they could still get to 75% for the second half of the year if they got an increase, even if they miss the first half objective. And maybe that was clear before, but I am not sure.\nAndrew Kligerman - UBS\nIt's a lot clearer now. So with regard to that question, do you have some optimism that they could potentially be flat in the second quarter and then get up zero to 5% year-over-year in the second half? What are you thinking as we move into the next three quarters?\nDan Amos\nAndrew, I honestly believe that the things that are within our control, we have the right initiatives in place to create short term and especially long-term results. Unfortunately, there still remains a large economic component to the factors that are contributing to our sales. And until I have a better grasp on improving economic conditions, I cannot really state what I think and how close we'll be to that. But in general, I would say that our field force remains extremely optimistic. The broker production in general remains backend loaded, with the largest emphasis being in the latter half of the year because of open enrollments that occur. And so, am I optimistic? I think that I am happy with the progress we are making internally.\nAndrew Kligerman - UBS\nAnd then, Paul, maybe just to follow up, this is the first time in a while I've heard about any contraction with the sales coordinators, and you mentioned some is attrition, some you wanted to move out of that role earlier in this call. Is there a problem right now with the sales coordinators? Do you have any concerns at this stage in the game?\nPaul Amos II\nI honestly believe that there is always a rise and fall as you grow. The question is where is the trajectory in the long term? I believe that we contracted backwards to consolidate certain over expanded areas, where people and coordinators specifically were not making enough money to really be sustainable. As a result, it did decrease our recruiting and training capacity. But I believe long term we'll create stronger organization that can then grow and provide people opportunities to take on management roles. So, do I have an expectation in the long term of that number of coordinators growing? I do. Do I think it will be massive growth? I don't, I think it will be a linear growth that will happen over time as a result of people being successful and being given the opportunity to grow their operation as has been historical with Aflac.\nKen Janke Jr.\nCaroline, I'm showing that we've reached the top of the hour, 10 o'clock. So I'm afraid if there are still people in the queue, please feel free to call Robin Wilkey or myself. We'll be happy to continue the dialogue and take your questions. And thank you again for joining us and we hope to see you at our Analyst Meeting in just a couple of weeks.\nOperator\nThank you. That concludes today's conference call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.\nI would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue's VP of Investor Relations, David Fintzen. Please go ahead.\nDavid Fintzen\nThanks, Mel. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. This morning we issued our earnings release, our investor update and a presentation we'll reference during this call. All those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC.\nJoining me here in New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Priest, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A are Scott Laurence, Head of Revenue and Planning and Dave Clark, VP of Sales and Revenue Management.\nThis morning's call includes forward-looking statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors and therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. For additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ from the forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release, 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC.\nAlso during the course of our call, we may discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website.\nAnd now, I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes\nThank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I hope you're doing okay. As we've done in previous earnings calls, since the pandemic began, I would like to pause and remember lost crew members; one of the 10 we have now lost to COVID-19. Garrett Gan [ph] was part of our ground operations team at JFK since 2005 and his teammates will remember him for his kindness, his passion and warmth, and his willingness to always go above and beyond. Our thoughts go out to Garrett's family and friends, to all of our crew members that knew him and also everyone so impacted by this pandemic.\nNow, I'd like to recognize our 20,000 crew members for their unwavering commitment to serve our customers. 2020 was a year like no other. And as the COVID-19 pandemic challenged our industry in ways we have never seen before. Our crew members rose to the occasion and delivered on our mission to inspire humanity. The very foundation of our business model, our culture, our passion, our customer service and our focus on safety, continue to guide us as we march towards recovery.\nAt JetBlue, we have been investing in our culture of over 20 years and our longstanding commitment to empowering our crew members is now more important than ever. As a service company, the pandemic and cries for social justice have underscored our role in reducing biases that have existed for too long.\nWe are starting 2021 with a reinvigorated diversity, equity and inclusion plan. Our commitment is to better embed DEI into the fabric of JetBlue and to continue our minority and female representation in officer and director ranks - continue to increase our minority and female representation in officer and director ranks between now and the end of 2025. We are also reinforcing our commitment to invest in our crew members and improve the access to development opportunities.\nLastly, we intend to better reflect the diverse communities and cultures we serve in all areas of JetBlue. We believe JetBlue will continue to set the standard in our industry with our comprehensive ESG strategy, and were the first airline with FASB reporting.\nOur commitment to the environment is to reduce emissions across our business as we respond to the changing expectations of our customers, crew members and owners. Today, we are the only US airline that has achieved carbon neutrality for all domestic flights. We also intend to achieve net carbon emissions across all of our operations - net zero-carbon emissions across all our operations by the end of 2040 at the latest.\nOur plan is to accomplish these goals through a fuel-efficient aircraft, expanding our use of sustainable aviation fuels, and purchasing carbon offsets. Later this year, we plan to publish our annual ESG report, detailing new initiative, strategies and disclosures and we'll continue our conversations with all our stakeholders. I'm proud that while we are in the middle of a pandemic, our team continues to prioritize our work on ESG.\nNow, let's move to slide four of our presentation. In the fourth quarter, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.53. Despite the financial results, I'm proud of what our crew members have accomplished in this extraordinary year, and I could not be more confident about our future.\nOur team has not only managed through the ongoing demand challenges, but also have made important progress on strategic initiatives, including revenue, capacity and cost actions. Through this work, we believe we will emerge as a stronger JetBlue.\nMoving to slide five. We continue on our path to recovery, which consists of three steps. First, reducing our cash burn, second, rebuilding our margins, and third, repairing our balance sheet. As we moved through 2020 and meaningfully reduced our cash burn and we are now starting to shift our focus to rebuilding our margins.\nWe remain cautiously optimistic that demand trends will improve later this year. More importantly, this crisis has made us a more agile, creative and resilient airline. And we believe our initiatives will allow us to emerge with structurally better margins.\nLet's start with our network plan. We have taken aggressive actions to protect cash and remain relevant in our focus cities and announced over 80 new markets, while accelerating our expansion in historically constrained markets such as New York and LAX.\nWe are thrilled to incorporate new aircraft into our fleet that will support our network plans. This year, we are bringing in the game-changing A220 and it's fantastic economics. We'll also fly the low-density A321neo and the A321LR, both of which include our incredibly exciting new mint product, which will carry forward our success in disrupting and re-imagining premium travel at significantly lower fares.\nWe're so excited to shortly launch our landmark Northeast alliance with American Airlines. This is a truly innovative partnership between two independent airlines. Through our different business models, we expect to expand flying in highly constrained markets and bring more low fares to more customers.\nWe plan to offer new and increased flight options, improved schedules, better connections and more competitive fares. Our customers will have access to more domestic and international destination and an improved frequent flyer program. For JetBlue, this alliance will help us recover more quickly, while also protecting jobs.\nBeyond fleet and network, we plan to continue to enhance our digital experience and develop our JetBlue travel products offering. Last year, we re-launched JetBlue Vacations, bringing innovative new benefit to vacation packages such as personalized service in destination, travel perks, payment flexibility, and a best price guarantee. We also enhanced our travel insurance product.\nWe are now working to scale up our platform to help our customers easily add products for their travel plans with JetBlue. The initial results are encouraging and we believe that as leisure traffic returns, we will see attach rates improving compared to our pre-COVID rates.\nLastly, we remain committed to keeping our costs low and ensuring that our efforts across JetBlue translate into better margins and higher earnings. We continue to find meaningful opportunities to both - in both our fixed and variable cost structures, which reinforces our low cost, low fare leisure model. Steve will provide more detail on our 2021 cost plan and how this adds to the cost savings we achieved through our structural cost program.\nOf course, all these efforts would not be possible without our incredible crew members. I want to thank them for their personal sacrifice, as this crisis has impacted their lives with reduced hours and reduced paychecks.\nAnd on behalf of all of our crew members, I want to thank our government leaders, particularly at the U.S. Treasury for their continued and vital support for our industry, which has helped save many jobs.\nWe are, as we all know, navigating the most challenging times in our history. But we are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. Our team will continue to do everything we can to protect the future of JetBlue, protect our crew members and emerge as a stronger airline.\nJoanna, over to you.\nJoanna Geraghty\nThank you, Robin. First, a shout out to our crew members who continue to manage all of the challenges and operational complexities associated with COVID. They are delivering a safe and healthy experience day in and day out for our customers and have truly been at the center of our Safety from the Ground Up Program. They continue to instill confidence that flying remains a safe mode of travel. And thanks to them, we saw, in 2020, one of the highest NPS scores in our recorded history.\nConsistently delivering on our safety commitments remains one of the top reasons why customers are returning to air travel and why when given the choice, they are choosing JetBlue. And we continue to evolve our program to reflect the most current information about COVID and addressing the areas that customers tell us they need to see addressed to get them flying again.\nOur focus remains on cleanliness, reduce touchpoints and air quality. And we are also prioritizing efforts to educate our customers about the changing regulatory requirements associated with air travel, including testing, quarantine and documentation requirements. We know that many customers want to travel and we are trying to help them more easily navigate the landscape.\nWe are working with CommonPass, a health records platform in certain markets to help customers easily validate their COVID status prior to travel. We have an eye toward including verifiable vaccine information in such a platform as we believe this will be an important part of future travel.\nWe are also offering pre-departure and arrival testing options in Boston and JFK with XpresCheck and we continue to grow our partnership with Vault Health, providing customers with a home-based testing option, both within the United States and internationally. We will continue to work on options that help our customers more easily navigate this landscape, while also pivoting to vaccine documentation.\nMoving to slide seven. In the fourth quarter, our revenue declined 67% year-over-year. This marks a nine-point sequential improvement from the prior quarter, and while demand improved in October, booking trends slowed in November following increasing case counts and the CDC recommendation to avoid travel during the holidays. However, even with this headwind, we were pleased to close the quarter with the December holidays providing our highest traffic volumes since the start of the pandemic.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our Latin and Caribbean franchise continued to perform relatively well with demand being led by our VFR markets, as well as a modest increase of customers traveling to leisure markets. All of our domestic regions also saw revenue growth quarter-over-quarter with Florida markets having the greatest improvement domestically.\nDespite this progress in the fourth quarter, our geographic challenges persist with elevated case counts and continued quarantine measures, particularly, in the Northeast and California.\nFor the first quarter of 2021, our planning assumption for revenue is a decline between 65% and 70% versus the first quarter of 2019. We saw increased demand from Martin Luther King weekend and are seeing a similar pattern for Presidents Day weekend, but we do not anticipate traffic to reach the levels of late December.\nThe CDC order, effective earlier this week, requiring all customers over the age of two to present a negative COVID test before entering the U.S. is also pressuring bookings in our international markets. As a result of these international travel restrictions, we are seeing increased leisure demand to Florida, including our new Blue cities of Miami and Key West. However, Florida fares are low with relatively high levels of industry capacity.\nOur revenue plan for 2021 continues to evolve, and as we've said all along, we do not expect that recovery will be linear. We believe that we will begin to see material revenue recovery when there is a meaningful and sustained decrease in COVID case counts.\nAs proof points, we saw demand accelerate back in May and August when case counts started to decline. We expect to see much of the same as case counts decrease in the coming weeks and months, particularly in the Northeast, where we believe demand may accelerate at a higher pace, given more stringent quarantines.\nWe are optimistic that this decrease will come when there is increased immunity across the population. We also believe that governments will adjust travel restrictions with decrease in case counts, further fueling demand.\nAt present, the booking curve is relatively short. As case counts come down, customers will be able to more confidently plan future trips, leading to a lengthening of the booking curve.\nAs we move to a recovery phase, we believe that our predominantly leisure footprint and low-cost structure supported by our strategic initiatives should position JetBlue well, exiting the pandemic.\nWe are excited about our recent upgrade to a new revenue management system, part of our continuous improvement in our revenue management tools. The system enables us to better forecast demand and better understand customer elasticity, which is a key tool for driving increased revenue.\nWe are also implementing EMD capabilities that will allow us to sell ancillary products more broadly and also to price them more dynamically. We also continue to optimize our ancillary offerings, making our product and price proposition more competitive and more attractive to customers.\nWe remain very pleased with the up-sell behavior of fare options 2.0 since the rollout in 2019. As we continue to refine and improve our segmentation strategy, we will announce updates to fare option features in the coming weeks.\nWe've made additional strides toward a direct distribution strategy and have reduced the number of external partners that we work with. There are numerous channels for our customers to view our fares and offerings, but we are always encouraging them to book their travel at JetBlue.com.\nLastly, and certainly not least, our loyalty program is an area ripe for evolution. We see an opportunity for JetBlue to grow our revenue base substantially over the coming years via personalization and a program tailored to different types of customers and their preferences. We are also currently out with an RFP for our co-brand partnership to enhance our value proposition to the customers.\nTurning to capacity on slide eight. In the fourth quarter, our flown capacity declined\n47% year-over-year. For the first quarter of 2021, our planning assumption is for capacity to decline at least 40% versus Q1 2019.\nThe sequential growth is driven in part by expectations for improving demand trends in the back half of the quarter, and also by the extension of the Payroll Support Program, which brings down our cash breakeven load factors despite the headwinds of high fuel prices and seasonally lower fares.\nI want to recognize the many JetBlue teams who've been managing the peaks and troughs of the quarter, quickly ramping up the operation to over 700 flights per day during the holiday and dialing our flights back to less than 300 per day during troughs.\nWe continue to adjust our flying to areas of relative strength and over 15% of our capacity in the first quarter of 2021 is in new markets. We've been quick to add new flying in areas of strength, but also quick to pull capacity in underperforming areas.\nThank you to our network team for finding new and creative opportunities to deploy our fleet to support cash generation and the financial sustainability of JetBlue, as well as our operations, customer experience, and revenue teams for executing these opportunities so well.\nAs we move through 2021, we plan to bring capacity back in line with demand trends, addressing short term pressures, while solidify our long-term position in our focus cities. Thank you again to our crew members for closing out another year with their commitment to safety during what has been the most challenging year in JetBlue's history.\nWith that, over to you, Steve.\nSteve Priest\nThank you, Joanna. And good morning everyone. I would like to add my thanks to our crew members for doing a phenomenal job in 2020 taking care of each other and our customers and ensuring the financial health of JetBlue.\nTurning to slide 10 and a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was $661 million, down 67% year-over-year. Operating expenses were down 38% year-over-year. Excluding the benefit from CARES Act and charges related to fleets and voluntary leave programs for our crew members, operating expenses were down 34% year-over-year. GAAP loss per diluted share was $1.34 and adjusted loss per diluted share was $1.53.\nMoving on to slide 11. As Robin mentioned, we continue to make progress towards recovery, reducing our cash burn, laying the foundation to rebuild our margins and remaining committed to balance sheet repair.\nOur average daily cash burn for the fourth quarter was $6.7 million towards the lower end of the $6 million to $8 million range previously expected. This was a result of variable cost savings achieved through our balanced approach to capacity and the actions to minimize fixed costs across our business.\nAt the end of December, our total liquidity, including restricted and unrestricted cash, was $3.1 billion or 38% of our 2019 revenue. Our liquidity includes funds from the equity transaction we executed in December and sale leasebacks to finance aircraft deliveries.\nStarting this quarter, we will transition from reporting all-in cash burn to EBITDA. We believe that this metric brings better visibility to JetBlue's underlying performance as we move towards recovery.\nWe estimate our EBITDA for the first quarter will range between negative $525 million to $625 million, reflecting similar revenue trends for the fourth quarter, but also manifesting recent cost pressures from rents and landing fees, as well as fuel prices. For reference, we have included a reconciliation table in the Appendix section of our presentation.\nAs Joanna mentioned, we are starting the year with challenging demand trends and how we fall within the planned EBITDA range will depend on the pace of revenue recovery during the quarter.\nTurning to slide 12. During the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating expenses declined 34% year-over-year. This excludes the payroll benefit from CARES Act of $49 million. The CARES Act benefit related to employee retention credits for $36 million.\nIt also included a $15 million charge related to fleet impairments and $1 million in charges related to crew member opt-out programs. This performance, relative to our expectations, was driven by our capacity actions and solid cost execution during the quarter.\nOur working assumption for the first quarter is a reduction in our total operating expenses of approximately 25% year-over-two. The sequential quarterly increase is driven by our capacity plan and external cost headwinds, particularly rents and landing fees, as well as fuel prices. We anticipate some of these cost pressures will normalize over time as traffic volumes recover.\nMoving to slide 13. We continue to take aggressive approach to improve our cost structure and to help rebuild our margins. Our 2021 plan reduces our total operating costs by over $1.2 billion compared to 2019. We believe that executing our plan will put us on a path to emerge from the crisis with better CASM, ex-fuel in 2022 than 2019.\nNaturally, achieving our plan will be a function of demand recovery, bringing back capacity and ultimately taking our aircraft utilization to pre-crisis levels. In order to achieve our unit cost growth and improve our margins going forward, we are targeting a reduction in our 2021 fixed costs between $150 million to $200 million compared to 2019. For perspective, this is a 6% decline on our fixed cost base on a 6% larger fleet year-over-two.\nOur fixed cost savings will come from our support functions and business partners. We've restarted our support footprint through crew member opt-out programs and consolidating our real estate assets and plan on driving additional efficiencies across JetBlue. This includes automation, standardization of internal processes and, of course, aggressively managing our discretionary spend.\nThroughout 2020, we worked closely with our business partners to adjust our commitments and secure rate reductions, as well as payments modifications. This year, we will continue collaborating with them to right-size our contracts, increase the variable components of our pricing and further drive down our overall costs.\nIn addition to our work on fixed costs, we are aligning the variable portion of our cost structure to our capacity and network plan. We are focused on achieving savings by optimizing engine maintenance events, as we bring aircraft back to the operation and continuing to drive frontline productivity with the support of technology. Moreover, we are incorporating more fuel-efficient aircrafts into our fleet and increasing fuel efficiency measures throughout the operation.\nWe do expect some headwinds in 2021, which will undoubtedly develop, including investment to protect the health and safety of our customers. Low cost remains an absolutely strategic focus of JetBlue. At the beginning of 2020, we reported the completion of our structural cost program, resulting in run rate savings which will manifest in our P&L as we return to growth. We look forward to continuing the momentum and controlling our unit cost trajectory over the next few years.\nMoving to slide 14. In the fourth quarter, we took delivery of two A321neo's and our first A320 aircraft, bringing our year end fleet count to 267 aircrafts. During 2021, we expect delivery of seven A320, five A321neo's and three A321LRs with annual CapEx of approximately $1 billion.\nFor the swing of periods, 2020 to 2022, we lowered our CapEx by $2 billion compared to our pre-pandemic time. Our reworked order book would support our network strategy, protect our A320 deliveries, a platform we expect to deliver 30% lower direct operating cost per seat compared to our A1 launches [ph].\nMoving to slide 15. We continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry with a debt-to-cap ratio of 57% at the year end of 2020. We believe our current liquidity, our efforts to reduce cash burn, and our balance sheet strength will enable us to navigate the demand challenges of 2021. This quarter, we anticipate receiving over $500 million from the second round of the COVID Payroll Support Program, helping us protect jobs at JetBlue.\nI'll close with a final thank you to all of our crew members. We remain confident in our ability to protect JetBlue and position us for better days ahead. Although 2021 will be another challenging year, we remain nimble and continue to execute on our cost plan and commercial initiatives. We believe our hard work will begin to pay off and will make us stronger for the years to come.\nWith that, we will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen\nThanks, everyone. We're now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nDuane Pfennigwerth\nHey, thanks. Good morning. I'm just looking at your slides here with the reduction in total OpEx expected for 2021. What is the capacity base that you're assuming? And I guess what is the implication for unit costs?\nObviously, it's a little confusing here in the early part of the year. But just as we roll forward, kind of what does this imply for second half capacity in unit costs?\nSteve Priest\nHi, Duane. It's Steve here. Good morning, good to hear from you. Duane, if you just refer to slide 13 that you've talked about, you will see a footnote in terms of the assumption for capacity, full year 2021 capacity at 70% [ph] of 2019 capacity. The way that we are planning our business, Duane, is that we continue to see sequential improvement in the demand environment and hence capacity as we progress through 2021. Leaving '21 and entering '22 with comparable capacity for the sort of 2019 year.\nSo from a unit cost progression, I would expect that, that will improve as we gain momentum through 2021 because, naturally, we become more efficient as a business as we fly more of the fleet and we get back to sort of sense of normality. And our planning assumptions underpinning the economics that we've laid out from a cost standpoint is at 2022's capacity move of that 2019. But, obviously, that's all predicated on what happens in the demand environment, where things lie with vaccinations and coming out of the other side of COVID. Hopefully, that makes sense to you, sir.\nDuane Pfennigwerth\nYeah, that's good perspective. And then just on some of the fleet movement, as you bring on a new fleet type here and you're preparing for London flying, presumably, can you just quantify that the training or the approval cost associated with kind of new fleet types and Europe approval?\nSteve Priest\nYeah, good question, Duane. We have been ruthless over the last year about privatization across JetBlue. You can imagine an airline in many different priorities coming into 2020, and we have done a really great job at consolidating those. We've been really driven on some specific ones.\nFor example, the A220 that has got game-changing economics to protect and grow our margins as we go forward. And so embedded in our sort of 2021 cost plan are obviously the training and transition costs of bringing both the A220 and the A321LD - the new neo-LD, low density and the LR into the fleet and our launch to London later this year.\nSo that's all incorporated into our numbers and the teams have worked tirelessly to make sure we do this both in the right way, but we do it with the right economics. So that's all sort of embedded in there. And so that's where we are with that. Not, obviously, going to get into the specifics of those items. But just to give you confidence, that's all embedded in there and we're looking forward to having both aircraft enter into service during this year.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nCatherine O'Brien\nHey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Maybe just another one on cost for you, Steve. So can you share how we should think about what, if any, of that $1.2 billion and lower 2021 cost for 2019 is permanent as opposed to volume related? Is it just that $150 million to $200 million fixed cost amount you called out or there's more than that?\nSteve Priest\nHi, good morning, Cathy. Yes. So this is why we have laid out and giving you some transparency in our planning assumption between fixed and variable costs. And so, obviously, we have had the opportunity off the back of the structural cost program and during this pandemic to turnover every stone again and go even deeper to look at the fixed cost structure and keep and maintain as much of that fixed cost structure out as we sort of come back to normality going forward.\nAnd that, candidly, is where the $150 million to $200 million comes from in a number of areas like, as we sort of previously discussed, our support footprint, real estate consolidation, IT infrastructure and transition from data centers to the cloud, et cetera, just to mention a couple.\nNow, when I think about the variable cost structure, we did a huge amount of work associated with structural cost program where we really get the benefits with scale. And as we've come into 2021 with a compromised network, you obviously aren't getting economies of scale as that returns. And so the way we're thinking about is, there's a huge level of stickiness associated with fixed costs that we've taken out and we'll do everything, obviously, not to put them back in.\nBut also as we scale our business and we get our fleet utilization back up, you are going to see the fruits of our labor on our variable cost structure, which will continue to drive economies of scale. So again, hopefully, that gives you some color about how we've laid this out in a very transparent way so that you can see our game plan for the next couple of years.\nCatherine O'Brien\nYes, definitely. Thanks, Steve. And then maybe my second one, I think might be for Joanna, but - so with your network exposure to some of the more restricted parts of the country, the Northeast and California, what flying are you able to reallocate the parts of your network that might be seeing better demand trends? Are there any additional new markets you look at in addition to that, like, 15% of capacity you've got planned for the first quarter?\nAnd then, I guess, like, lastly, you probably told us, is there any way for us to think about order of magnitude, how much California and Northeast are underperforming in the rest of your network? Thanks for the time.\nJoanna Geraghty\nThanks a lot. Let me try to piece it apart. So, maybe broadly speaking, I think the team has done an exceptional job redeploying capacity to those areas where there is demand. So as Robin mentioned in his opening remarks, we've announced more than 80 new routes since the pandemic started. 15% of what we're seeing in 2021 is actually flying in new geographies, which is just, I think, fantastic and I think reflects the nimbleness and creativity of the team to address and try to mitigate that disproportionate impact that we are seeing in the Northeast.\nIn so far as California is concerned, it still represents a relatively small portion of our overall network. That said, we are pleased to see the stay-at-home orders lifting and optimistic that we will see demand recover in, I'd say, medium time frame for California as we've seen in other parts of the country where quarantine have been lifted and where case counts have dropped. So we're encouraged by that.\nAt the end of the day, as we think about the Northeast and our footprint here, I think we've been very transparent. It is an area that's been disproportionately impacted, but we do believe, when case counts come down, when more customers are vaccinated, when quarantines are lifted, that there will be an even greater level of pent-up demand in the Northeast because of these stricter quarantines, and we're well positioned for recovery in those areas as an airline that was born to do leisure travel for low fares for customers at a low cost.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nJamie Baker\nHey. Good morning everybody. Joanna, I'm going to ask a question that reveals my ignorance about revenue management. But I'm going to ask it anyway. So please bear with me while I publicly embarrass myself.\nAfter the Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia, fares in the shuttle market, including those of JetBlue, shot up to levels that I don't think anybody had ever witnessed, airlines were accused of price gouging. But the reality as I understand it is the pricing systems were just overwhelmed and passengers were pushed into fare categories that I don't think any airline ever intended to charge.\nWhen the U.K. first went into lockdown, Ryan Air experienced something similar, folks trying to rush home before a deadline. It wasn't that they raised fares, it's just that the systems were overwhelmed. I'm not suggesting we're going to see a nationwide repeat of this, but my question relates to pricing automation.\nI mean, are the systems just being left on cruise control? How much human intervention typically takes place? I'm not asking about future pricing. I just wonder if there is an RM or a pricing angle related to automation that might influence yield when you consider that demand could come back in a way that your systems aren't ordinarily calibrated for. Does that make any sense?\nJoanna Geraghty\nYeah. I'm going to throw it to Robin because he is anxious to answer this question.\nRobin Hayes\nHey, Jamie. Good morning. I'm not going to answer your question as you would expect, but I'm going to call the flag on your self-proclaimed statement that revenue management is not your thing. We know that's not true.\nJamie Baker\nYou're too kind.\nRobin Hayes\nMaybe like a hobby of yours, and we will now do the best to answer your questions. So, Joanna, and then maybe, Dave.\nJoanna Geraghty\nYeah, I'll just start. I think it's a great question, Jamie. And there has obviously been quite a bit of human intervention this year because so much of the data that we've historically relied upon in our systems has not been indicative of demand trends and some of these external factors that have factored into whether customers are flying, pandemic case counts, travel bans and quarantines.\nAnd so I'm going to have Dave get into a little detail. I'm going to ask Dave not to take the entire earnings call to do that because I know he would love to. But Dave, maybe you can provide a little detail on your thinking and then the new system - the new automation system that we're thinking of.\nDave Clark\nYes, thanks, Jamie, for the question. This is Dave. It's a really good one. It's a difficult time for revenue management systems in general because demand is so choppy and can change frequently in volatility. So there has been more human intervention, I think, than normal, certainly at JetBlue and just in general. And historically, you mentioned some, say, big shocks like a natural disaster, which has driven prices up because the system sort of normally do that if left on other [ph].\nBut we focused a lot in the last few years on, one, ensuring that doesn't happen through manual intervention and we've had a very good several year track record of making sure we have focus on low fares. And, two, just sort of ensuring that we have low fares in general, not even during shocks like that, but overall.\nSo going forward, hopefully we will see, in the coming quarter or two, a nice demand increase as case counts comes down and vaccinations go up. I don't think it will be anywhere near the level we've seen in some of the past shocks. But it will certainly be something that we'll be working closely to ensure that fares stay relatively low and appropriate, and that we get more customers on board as demand recovers.\nRobin Hayes\nAnd I think, Jamie, it's Robin. I just want to close that out. It's a great question. I mean, I'm actually very proud of JetBlue's record when these events have happened. I mean, you talked about the Amtrak tragic accident, but I think about think about hurricane Irma, Maria some of these other natural disasters we had that do it a similar thing. I mean, we have led the industry in fare caps, making sure fares are artificially low so that we can get people to travel at those times and at affordable level. And that's something that we're going to continue to do when these types of events happen.\nJamie Baker\nThank you for answering my question so gracefully. I appreciate it. Real quick follow-up, it will be short. I do remember Continental top-ticking the market with its Heathrow slot purchase. I think they paid something like, I don't know, $200 million for four pairs. I'm not going to ask what your willingness to pay is, but I haven't kept up with recent transactions for the time slots you're interested in. Where is the market right now?\nRobin Hayes\nHey, Jamie, you do an amazing job. And I'm not going to go there either. I would say that, obviously, we are still on track for a Q3 London launch. Obviously, we are paying attention to what's going on. We will - we'll go out for sale when we think the time is right and that's when we'll share our thinking on slots.\nWhat I'd say, at a general level, about Heathrow slots, as you know, with the slot waivers that have gone in there, the sort of scenario last year may be that - maybe some commentary around airlines who were cash-strapped, they would sort of monetize Heathrow slots because they couldn't fly them obviously with the way waiver process that hasn't happened. And so, again, we continue to sort of have path to more than one London airport and more in due course.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nHelane Becker\nThanks, operator. Kind of touch or follow Jamie, but would - there's still some discussion on domestic testing, so I have two questions regarding that. Would you support it is the first one? And the second one is what - you fly a lot of VFR into the Caribbean and Puerto Rico, specifically, what's the - what does it look like there from a testing capability and from a demand capability to continue flying those routes and are people there also getting vaccinated enough in timely fashion?\nJoanna Geraghty\nSure. So I'll start with your second question first. So, Puerto Rico, we definitely see some constraints with testing in that environment. We've actually partnered with Vault Health, which is an at-home option to try to encourage more customers to use that option in Puerto Rico for travel. I know that Puerto Rico tourism is very encouraged by that. And we are seeing a decent amount of domestic bookings, given the CDC quarantine coming into the international market. So we are seeing an uptick in that area.\nWith regard to our views on domestic testing, I think, first, we're trying to take a step back and recognize that the government is trying to balance a number of factors. It's a new administration, they're crying about economic recovery, public health considerations and stepping into a crisis like this.\nAir travel, we know it's safe, there's numerous scientific studies that have shown the aircraft is safe. We are not supportive of testing on the domestic front for a few reasons. I think, first the virus is here, there is community spread, we really want the CDC to work with the industry to come up with pragmatic solutions to help mitigate the right risks, and frankly address some of the real operational complexities.\nThe testing regime that CDC put in place for international, that's, I think, then as good as you can get, given that international already has a framework for document checking and whatnot. And that was really - the goal towards that was really to use that as an alternative to quarantines.\nObviously, it hasn't quite worked out in the same way, but there is a framework there and we would expect, in the coming days, for the CDC testing framework to kind of settle in and folks would adjust to that. But on the domestic front, it's hard to see practically something like that working at that scale.\nAir travel is just one mode of travel. You obviously have rail, road transportation, people need to travel, they'll figure out a way to get there. They'll figure out a way to see Mom, Dad and frankly putting this burden on air travel is, we think, far too cumbersome.\nI also have concerns around just the testing capacity in the United States, I think, teasing out a little bit about what you're saying about Puerto Rico. In many parts of the country, testing slots are scarce and it takes, frankly, many days and some cases actually get results back.\nWe know based on what U.S. Travel and Tourism has recently said that if you start testing domestically, we'd see 42% more people introduced into the current testing framework on a daily basis.\nAnd so when you start thinking about a framework that's already overburdened, and you add domestic travelers into that, this puts a ton of pressure on an already fragile system and, frankly, we're concerned that it would actually reduce the ability of some people who legitimately need to get tested for health reasons to get tested.\nAnd then you look at our crew members and asking them to, whether it's check documentation, check attestation domestically, we already have them as the mask police. We already have them as the social distance police, adding document checks and testing validations put them in, frankly, an untenable position and in an environment where we're trying to promote social distancing.\nSo we have real concerns about this. We are open to reasonable measures. But we don't believe a domestic testing regime is feasible, given the existing framework.\nHelane Becker\nThat is great, and it's very helpful and hugely detailed. Thanks, Joanna. That was my question. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nSavi Syth\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Steve, maybe just on the CapEx front, I was kind of curious how you're thinking about like 2022 or normalized levels. It seems like there will be fewer aircraft deliveries, especially in 2022. Curious, if like 2021 is a high watermark. And also related to that, is the E190 retirement, it looks like they're delayed, is that because there is slower A321s coming in?\nSteve Priest\nHi, Savi. Good morning. Good to speak to you. I've been very pleased and proud of the work that has taken place over the last nine months and a little shout out to our partner Airbus who sort of did two amendments to our order book and to take $2 billion of CapEx out over the 2020-22 period. It has been incredibly helpful as we've navigated this pandemic and also thoughts about aircraft needs as we go forward. However, I suppose to your tangential point, the A220, we're incredibly excited about taking that shell. We had our first one arrive on December 31, can't wait to get into operation, and they'll provide game-changing economics.\nSo with regards to '22, when you look at the order book, you're right, we have sort of a lower order book than we had before the pandemic. And as you look out, we will continue to refine and look at our order book. Obviously, one has more flexibility the further out that you go to make sure that we got the balance right between our CapEx profile and also investing in high return, high margin aircraft to support our operation and drive margins for JetBlue.\nSpecifically for the E190, nothing has changed. Our first A220 has arrived, we're going through the prices as a reminder. It's a - the plan is for a one-to-one replacement, looking forward to the A220 coming in for EIS. We currently have over 25% of our current E190 in storage at the moment.\nAnd so there is nothing to sort of say or nothing to change there. And you can expect this in due course is that we got a penetration of A220s into the fleet that we'll see the E190s rolled out. So a very considered and strategic approach to our fleet plan which will support margins for the years to come.\nSavi Syth\nSo then maybe thinking of 2021 CapEx as a high watermark is probably not a fair comment. Is it?\nSteve Priest\nI think it is when you look into this near-term because of what we've done to rationalize our sort of '22 order book. Even if we've got spiky levels of CapEx, as we go further out, naturally, you end up smoothing things accordingly. So as I said, this should be a high watermark in relation to 2022. But, sort of the '23 and beyond, we'll continue to work on the order book to get our balance right.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nBrandon Oglenski\nYeah. Hey, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. I guess, Robin or Joanna, if I listen to every airlines conference calls this quarter, everyone has got a good plan and a positive view on the future. But specific to you guys, with your focus on margins, what happens if everyone comes back to pre-pandemic levels of capacity, but we just don't see the level of business demand or maybe leisure demand as we think it will be?\nWhat are some of the levers you can pull? Especially we see United getting back into the Transcon from JFK. Isn't this potentially going to be a much more competitive environment, especially, domestically, looking forward?\nJoanna Geraghty\nThanks. I'll take that. So we recognize that other carriers are redeploying their fleets. I think at the end of the day, this is what JetBlue does. We fly leisure customers from the North to the South at low fares and we have a cost structure that enables us to do that and to do that very well.\nOur loyalty program is built for leisure, our operation is built for leisure. Obviously, our goal is always to balance supply and demand, but at the end of the day that we're going to be competitive here. And so I think we're proud of this track record. We'll continue to lean into leisure VFR markets where the demand is, as we move forward, and that's our plan for the future.\nWe've got a number of interesting revenue initiatives in the hopper as we've discussed on the call, and we think that will give us some additional wind in our sail. Robin, you want to add?\nRobin Hayes\nJoanna, I think that's great and just a bit on - Brandon, obviously, we are - we very firmly believe that we have some very specific JetBlue tailwinds. I mean, we're excited about our partnership with American Airlines. Joanna mentioned our focus on loyalty and the co-brand RFP. We think that is a total value.\nI think we had a lot of conversations honestly about CapEx and what is the right mix of CapEx right now, but the fleet changes we're making are very margin-accretive and important, and then of course just our focus on costs. I mean, we, I think, have over a period of four-years changed the culture of how we think about costs at JetBlue. And that is, as you know, a critical part of managing margin.\nSo there's the sort of overall macro environment where I think leisure - I'm still convinced leisure will come up. There is so much pent-up demand, so much pent-up demand, I think we recognize that. And then there is all the JetBlue specific things that we've talked about before and I think all of those position us really well for margin expansion in the years ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski\nYeah. I appreciate that response. I guess, Joanna, you did talk about changes to your fare and ancillary pricing strategy. Is that - should we read, hey, we want to get to lower fare in front of consumers and maybe put more emphasis on the ancillary going forward?\nJoanna Geraghty\nYeah, I'd say, put more emphasis on ancillaries and, frankly, better providing customers in different segments what they value. And that's - I'll leave it at that.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nMike Linenberg\nYeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Two here, I guess, first to - it's probably Scott and Joanna on, one, congrats on getting the agreement with the DoT and the agreement with American in place. How should we think about how that agreement ramps up? I asked because on the American call, they talked about how they have negotiated, I guess, their first corporate contracts with Alaska for West Coast accounts.\nSo presumably, you're going to participate. That's probably part of the agreement with American in the Northeast. Is it code-sharing first followed by frequent flyer reciprocity, maybe there is club room access on American? Can you just kind of run through how things ramped through 2021 on that agreement? Thank you.\nRobin Hayes\nYeah. Hi, Mike, great question. It's Robin. Obviously, I will - I'll start it and then maybe hand over to Scott on some of the more specifics, but we are, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are very excited about this. If I think about one of our biggest frustrations at JetBlue over the last several years is that we couldn't do more in the Northeast to bring our great product and service and our low fares to more people. And also some of our challenge is being competitive with some of the corporate accounts because of a lack of our global network.\nAnd so, when I think about why we at JetBlue are excited about this and we've been through a very extensive six-month review with DoT on this, is that this is going to allow us to do - and Joanna said it earlier, what we do best at JetBlue, flying JetBlue to more markets and to bring more low fares, and it has been documented over many years.\nWhen JetBlue is flying in the market, the positive impact it has on competition. There are still too many routes in the Northeast where our competition doesn't exist. And so that's why we're excited. I know that's not the question that you asked, but I wanted to sort of get that out there. And then maybe, Scott, obviously, on some of the specifics.\nScott Laurence\nSure and thanks, Robin and thanks, Mike, for the question. I think we're really excited about this as Robin talked about. What I foresee is moving very quickly on code, that's something that definitely will take place in the first quarter and we're doing everything we can to accelerate that to get the customer benefits out there.\nMoving into that, I think we'll have more to report on frequent traveler reciprocity and what we're doing on the sales side as well, because that leans in very nicely to some of the things that, frankly, we couldn't do without this partnership and Robin referred to that, so things like growth in LaGuardia. There is a number of LaGuardia markets right now that are served by a monopolist. We think that's a great opportunity for us to disrupt, certainly into the coastal Southeast, that's the case.\nAnd then going forward, when we think about sales contracts and things like that, I think, as the Transcon recovers, bringing Mint to bear, doing so with access in some cases to the corporate accounts that our partner has, I think, is really something that's powerful in terms of bringing competition, bringing lower fares.\nAnd then lastly, as we bring code, going forward, we're seeing American launching long-haul flying from New York, we look forward to feeding that and creating again a sort of third global competitor in the Northeast, that's really important, it's highly beneficial for us.\nIt means faster recovery, it means - it's frankly - it's saving jobs. It's all sorts of the things that we look at to recover more quickly and I think that excitement that we've got is building here, because we really want to get moving.\nMike Linenberg\nOkay. Great, that's fantastic, Scott and Robin. Just one quick one on Heathrow slots, your access to Heathrow. Just remind me, as I recall, I think that there were some remedy slots. I think there was a pair tied to Boston and one tied to South Florida. Are those still out there or maybe others are using? And then does the A321neoXLR, would that have the range from South Florida to London? I apologize it's sort of a two-parter but.\nScott Laurence\nSo, this is Scott. I'll take that one. There's three slots over there we pursued, continue to pursue. They were awarded to another carrier who we have not seen them moving forward with those. So we'll see what direction that goes. I think we'll continue to move forward and pursue that. But we have not seen a lot of eagerness by that competitor to frankly serve those markets.\nSo as far as the 321XLR, it's a very interesting airplane. It does bring a level of - a lot more capability that exceeds the 321LR as far as Florida to Europe. I don't want to put the cart before the horse, but the airplane is likely capable there. There are some specific issues to Fort Lauderdale that we would have to overcome, but we're pretty interested in, when that airplane does come in, what we can do with it.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nHunter Keay\nHey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting me in. Hey, Dave Clark, a question for you. When you think about adding back supply with improving demand and you see these weekly or daily revenue runs, which metrics can you see and which is the one that you prioritize most?\nDave Clark\nThanks, Hunter, for the question. We've been really focused in the past months on volume and on getting customers on board, on getting them traveling, getting them to have a good experience so they come back and tell their family, tell their friends and it keeps sort of the virtuous circle going. So for the past month and I expect, in the coming weeks and months, we'll be quite focused on our customers volume and getting people in the skies again.\nHunter Keay\nSo you're looking like a book-to-load factor exclusively at this point pretty much.\nDave Clark\nJust in general, again, incentivizing travel, stimulating more traffic. We've had a lot of promotions, just generally driving volume has been the number one, returning to revenue through a volume and on-board customer focus.\nOperator\nNext question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nJoseph DeNardi\nThanks for getting me in. Joanna, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about the co-brand RFP, maybe why that path was chosen rather than an extension. And is now a good time or a bad time to be going through the RFP process? I guess, I could see both sides but just interested in your perspective. Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty\nYeah, thanks. Thanks, Joe. So let me start with we've been very pleased with the performance, historically, of our co-brand card. I mean Barclays has and continues to be just a tremendous partner. We accelerated an RFP for our co-brand. We felt that it was the right time to do so. Various carriers had renegotiated their deals recently and I don't want to get the cart ahead of the horse, but at the end of the day, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing and all I'd say is more to come when we're ready to come out with further analysis.\nJoseph DeNardi\nOkay. And then for Robin, just on this notion that there's all this pent-up demand, which I would tend to agree with, if that's the case, why shouldn't demand in 2022 for you all be higher than it was in 2019?\nLike, where are you expecting the offsets to come from? Is it a certain demographic or maybe just speak to kind of why that shouldn't produce higher demand structurally in the future? Thank you.\nRobin Hayes\nSure. I mean, maybe I'll just build on a thought that Dave had earlier about the short-term and then sort of segue to a longer term. I mean, right now, I think it's important to get people on airplanes because what our research tells us is that our customer NPS scores are really active at record highs. People have an overall very positive reaction to how safe the industry has made air travel.\nAnd so what we find is once people have that experience, they tell people and that's part of how we're building confidence. So, yes, it drives an environment in the short term where people are focused on volume, but that is about revenue maximization because that's what we think is going to drive the recovery most quickest.\nWhen we look at the longer-term view, look, we just don't know. I mean, I think, what we want to do is plan conservatively, plan cautiously. We certainly don't want to build a business plan that relies on a huge amount of demand recovery. So we have to focus on costs and we have to focus on some of the other things that we can control.\nWe also are excited about the American partnership because we know that is something that's going to help our recovery. If it's there, we'll be there to take it. We are - we built a very nimble response and JetBlue knows how to drive very high aircraft utilization. So we know how to sort of put that incremental capacity back if the demand is there.\nSo we're going to continue, I think, to take a cautious view in the short term. I don't think there's any medals right now for over-promising on revenue. We need to be focused and we need to be creative to do everything we can to build recovery and we need to size our company for margin expansion and we need to be there to take advantage of the demand as and when it comes back. And that's what we like setting out to do.\nOperator\nThank you. Question from the line of Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nDan McKenzie\nYeah. Hey, thanks. A couple of questions here. Just going back to the partnership with American, I'm just wondering if you can help us understand what that ultimately is going to mean. So ballpark, big picture, what could the economics ultimately look like in a normalized world?\nAnd I guess just thinking even big picture, business travel 20% historically. Is the goal to get it to 22%, 25% or what can this partnership actually help you accomplish, 30%? Big picture, what can you share?\nRobin Hayes\nScott, do you want to take that?\nScott Laurence\nYeah. So - I'll take that. I think we're not in a mode to sort of disclose where this can go in part because the environment, we're in right now makes the longer-term recovery a difficult question. But I would say this, I think, if you look at the potential there and sort of the ability to serve business customers, I think that this partnership is prime for that for two reasons.\nOne is, it brings sorely needed competition where you've got two large legacies who have dominated the Northeast for business customers. There is an opportunity here to kind of break that up and open things up. And as business recovers, one of the things that's going to be there is providing competition and lower fares is something that we can do and better access.\nSo, I think we're very excited about that. I think also as you think about access to markets like LaGuardia, and again, I think for JetBlue, that's something that we coveted for some time.\nThe ability to work with American to be able to grow at LaGuardia, to take advantage, not only have that access, but then again, as we work together to have additional relevance in some of the more business-oriented markets in the Midwest, for example, that we have not been able to break into, historically, I think that gives us a chance to push that number up.\nSo again, I think, on a percentage of customers flying for business, I think, that's going to be heavily dependent upon how quickly we see a recovery move. And again, I think as you look into 2023, years like that where other carriers are talking about a business traffic recovery, I think we end up with a number better than we've seen historically.\nDan McKenzie\nOkay, very good. Second question here. I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on discussions with the Caribbean or Latin American governments and their willingness to embrace a travel passport. I guess, what are you learning from a pilot program that may be underway currently?\nWhat are the logistical hurdles to wide-scale rollout? Is it just simply government saying yes or no and does it get turned on the next day or how can we think about how that would enable a potential recovery?\nJoanna Geraghty\nYeah, I'll take that. So we definitely think it will enable a potential recovery. I think, more importantly, it will just make the experience easier and more seamless for customers and hopefully assist crew members and airline employees with document validation. So East Caribbean Island is an individual Caribbean island, and you need to work individually with them, some are further along, I'll call out Aruba, for example. They've done an exceptional job. We - we're working very closely with them. I know other carriers are as well.\nAnd as an industry, we've actually agreed to a set of principles that outline, I mean, a health passport, ideally, a standardized set of, call them, requirements. Obviously different carriers are going to pick different health passport providers, but ideally you would have a common framework and a common set of standards, regardless of that platform to make it easy across platforms and across different islands, so encouraging, obviously, those governments to use that same set of criteria.\nSo it is on an individual by island basis, which does make it take a little bit longer, but we do think that necessity is the mother of invention. And if you actually look at the CDC order that came out this week, we've had very few denied boardings in most of our international locations. Day one was bumpy, day two, a lot better, day three will be a lot better. Testing centers are popping up in all sorts of places. You've got hotels offering testing. And so things will adjust and we think that we'll all adjust with it and that will support and bring back demand recovery as we step into the late spring and early summer.\nDavid Fintzen\nAnd that concludes our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator\nThank you. And again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.\n\n",

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.\nChris Stent\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson; and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. In addition, McDonald's USA President, Mike Andres will join us for Q&A.\nToday's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast, and podcast.\nBefore I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.McDonald's.com, as are our reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.\nAnd now, I'd like to turn it over to Don. Don?\nDon Thompson\nThank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. 2014 was a difficult year, during which performance fell short of our expectations. But it was also a building year. As we entered 2014, we were well aware of the obstacles that we faced in terms of growing comparable sales and margins amid ongoing broad-based challenges and cost pressures throughout our P&L.\nNow, while some of the challenges were anticipated, others were not, like the supplier issue in Asia Pacific and Middle East Africa, and the volatile operating environment in Russia and the Ukraine. And we experienced shortfalls in our internal plans, particularly in key markets such as the U.S. In response to these shortfalls, we took a number of important steps to lay the foundation for our turnaround. We're acting with a sense of urgency as these steps are critical to addressing current performance and to advancing our longer term strategies.\nSpecifically, we renewed our focus on our customers with the evolution of our strategic plan. We brought in new talent in several major markets around the world to provide innovative thinking and fresh perspectives. We announced the changes that we are making to the U.S. organization to put decision-making and accountability closer to the customer. We redefined menu choice and personalization with the introduction of the Create Your Taste platform in Australia and the U.S. We focused on the service experience through an increased emphasis on operations excellence and the initiation of our global digital strategy. And we did more to bolster trust in brand McDonald's, because we know that when our customers feel good about us and about eating at McDonald's they visit us more often.\nNow, let's turn to 2014 results. In constant currencies, operating income was down 15% for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. Earnings per share was down 14% for the quarter and 11% for the full year, both in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the higher tax rate and the supplier issue in APMEA, earnings per share for the year would have been down 1% in constant currencies. For the full year, global system-wide sales grew 1% in constant currencies, and global comparable sales were down 1%. Comparable sales were down 90 basis points for the quarter.\nLooking to January, comparable sales are expected to be negative due in part to the shift in Chinese New Year and consumer perception issues in Japan. The changes we are making are designed to refocus our system on those areas that matter most to our customers today and for the future. And that starts with deepening our relationship with customers to increase relevance, drive traffic, and position McDonald's for longer term growth. Our actions are guided by our four strategic growth priorities, which are broad enough that markets adapt and focus on those elements most relevant to the local customer basis.\nBeyond our existing menu, we are asserting McDonald's burger leadership by offering greater customization and choice. Not only does Create Your Taste provide new menu news that excites consumers, it has the potential to lift sales of core classics, by bringing more customers into our restaurants. At the same time, we are strengthening the menu pipeline to create greater choice at the local level that reflects attributes like taste preferences and demographics, and those things that makes each market unique. Greater localization enables us to take advantage of those attributes and tailor our menu and our marketing efforts to strengthen our relevance and appeal to customers in those regions.\nYou will also see changes in our customer service models as we work to create more memorable experiences and to deliver unparalleled convenience. For example, multiple order point strategies include self-order kiosk, table service, or mobile order and payments will modernize our customers interact with our brand and quite simply make it easier to get McDonald's their way, whatever that might be.\nWe're also strengthening the value proposition. We're strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry level, core, and premium tiers of our menu. At the same time, we are thinking differently about how to encourage customers to bundle products and use add-on purchases to create a satisfying affordable meal.\nWe will also see a shift in the way we engage our customers and consumers in general. We are being bold and direct as we talk about what matters most to customers, especially the quality of our menu ingredients with multifaceted efforts like Our Food, Your Questions in markets including the U.S., Canada, and Australia.\nCollectively, these changes create the McDonald's Experience of the Future, which brings the work that's happening within each strategic priority together to deliver changes our customers will notice. It builds on the investments we've already made in technology, re-imaging our restaurants, and operations improvement with an increased emphasis on tangible customer-centric innovations for menu and service to profitability grow the business.\nWe have enduring competitive advantages that have served us well over time, and those advantages are even more relevant today. Our size and geographically diversified restaurant portfolio allow us to test new products and concepts at a local level, and then broadly scale those that are successful, like we've done in the past with beverages and like we are currently doing with Create Your Taste.\nMcDonald's operates as one single brand, allowing us to focus our energy and resources on evolving the customer experience and changing the way we engage with consumers, while also leveraging the equity inherent in our iconic core products.\nOur global infrastructure enables us to tap into a variety of perspectives and expertise. Our franchisees are an integral part of the communities in which they do business. Suppliers bring innovations in their disciplines, and company employees focus on strategic direction to complement day-to-day execution in our restaurants. And finally, our strong financial foundation, which is supported by industry-leading average unit volumes, it enables us to pursue our global growth priorities in every type of operating environment, while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders each year.\nNow, in our July call we outlined the steps required over a 12 to 18 months period to strengthen our foundation and enhance our relevance and appeal to customers. Having reached the six month mark, we're beginning to see signs of progress in some of our priority markets. While specifics vary across the markets, the underlying formula has been very consistent. In 2014, these markets brought in fresh leadership with new perspectives on how to get customers back in the restaurants. They strengthened franchisee alignment in those relationships and reemphasized value and reenergized our marketing approaches.\nWe're already seeing a shift in Australia which has over 900 restaurants. It started with fundamental improvements in our marketing efforts and across our entire menu and it was enabled by much stronger alignment with our franchisees. We're building on this strong foundation with plans to roll Create Your Taste across the majority of our restaurants by the end of this year. This is first of our priority markets to demonstrate signs of recovery with positive comparable sales and guest counts since September.\nIt will take longer to see an uptick in the U.S. which has more than 14,000 restaurants across 22 different regions. The changes we announced last year to create a flatter, more nimble organization have opened the door for decisions to be made closer to the customer. Mike Andres is on the call today, and he can share more during the Q&A about the work that's being done to take shape around our menu, marketing, and service, which will enhance our relevance and appeal to customers.\nNow, over to Germany; negative trends are beginning to moderate with the month of December marking the highest comparable sales performance in more than two years. While we expect an uneven recovery as market dynamics remain challenging in the near-term, we are focused on driving sales and guest counts by strengthening value offers, highlighting the quality of both core and premium products in our marketing messages, and aggressively pursuing growth opportunities within the family and breakfast businesses.\nOur position in Australia, the U.S., and Germany is much like what the U.K. experienced in the early 2000. We can and we will turn around these markets with a balanced approach.\nRussia and China are also key markets that are in a recovery mode. While the specific tactics are different, both markets are focused on enhancing our brand image and winning customers back by emphasizing food quality and also celebrating the many reasons to choose McDonald's, such as convenience and affordability.\nFourth quarter comparable sales in China were negative 6.7% due to the lingering impact of the supplier issue. Each month of the quarter showed sequential improvements, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing customer recovery efforts in the market.\nFinally, in Japan, the team continues to work to overcome significant challenges. The market is executing a multifaceted brand recovery campaign, which is designed to rebuild brand trust and strengthen quality and affordability perceptions. While we know these actions will win back customers, history tells us that these efforts would take time to resonate, so we expect continued volatility in the market through most of 2015.\n2015 will be a year of regaining momentum globally. We expect further growth amid the pockets of success we're already seeing. However, it will take time, especially in our larger markets for customers to notice the comprehensive changes that are underway. So our internal projections assume continued sales and earnings pressure and volatility in the business, particularly in the first half of the year.\nIn light of continuing headwinds, we made thoughtful adjustments to our 2015 plans, pulling back in some areas to fund key growth initiatives focused on delivering greater customer relevance, broader consumer reach, and better restaurant execution. For example, we've reduced capital expenditures by paring back on new store openings in markets that are experiencing significant near-term challenges, including China, Russia, Germany, and the United States. And we're redirecting G&A from the U.S. business incorporates to priority initiatives that will drive our growth. We are committed to taking necessary actions to improve performance and position McDonald's for enduring profitable growth into the future.\nAs we embarked on a New Year, we maintain high expectations of our sales and for our brand. I remain confident in our prospects, both in the near and long-term. We're keenly focused on the opportunities that exist within our global growth priorities to serve our customers' favorite food and drink, to create memorable experiences, to offer unparalleled convenience, and to become an even more trusted brand.\nWe're changing, and we're doing it aggressively. We know that some tactics will be different from market-to-market and region-to-region around the world. And that's why our plans are supported by comprehensive and localized execution approaches that rely on our franchisees, our company employees and suppliers to satisfy customer expectations and drive stronger business results.\nThanks again for being on the call everyone, and I'll now turn it over to Pete.\nPete Bensen\nThanks, Don, and hi, everyone. 2014 was a challenging year for McDonald's' all around the world. Our results were impacted on a variety of fronts and across each of our geographic segments.\nToday, I'll like to spend a few minutes putting our 2014 performance into perspective, providing details on some key fourth quarter numbers and outlining the critical components of our 2015 financial plan. I'll begin by reviewing our results for the quarter and full year, highlighting the three factors that had a notable impact on performance in each of our major geographic segments.\nFirst, the underperformance of our U.S. business; throughout 2014, our results reflect the impact of ongoing broad-based challenges, including operating in an increasingly competitive marketplace and the sluggish industry growth. For the year, the segment's operating income declined $257 million or 7% partly due to negative comparable sales and guest counts, which contributed to margin decline. U.S. results were also impacted by higher G&A spending and other operating expenses associated with positioning the U.S. business for the future, including the segment's revamped marketing approach and development of the new brand love campaign. We expect to encourage additional U.S. restructuring cost in the first quarter.\nThe second thing that we can item that affected our global result was the APMEA supplier issue. The total impact from loss sales and expenses associated with our customer recovery efforts was approximately $110 million or $0.09 per share for the quarter and $290 million or $0.23 per share for the full year. The markets most affected by this issue include China, Japan and Hong Kong. Prior to the supplier issue, these markets collectively represented about 10% of global system-wide sale and 5% of global operating income.\nIn APMEA, our results were also pressured by ongoing performance issues in Japan. With the full year, APMEA's operating income declined 28% or 25% in constant currencies, $430 million. Japan's contribution to APMEA's operating income includes royalties and the company share of McDonald's Japan after tax results.\nThe third significant impact on McDonald's global results for 2014 was in Russia and the Ukraine. During 2014, McDonald's Europe experienced significant decline in company operating margins driven by weakening currencies and economic slowdown and store closures in these two markets. For the year, Europe reported a $90 million decrease in operating income, a 2% decline in constant currencies with the segment's company-operated margins weighing heavily on results.\nThe entire operating income declined for the year with solely driven by Russian and the Ukraine company-operated margin results. Over half of this margin decline reflects the significant impact of weakening currencies on imported commodity costs in these two markets. We expect this currency impact to significantly pressure the segment's company-operated margin again in 2015, especially in the first half.\nWhile we expect to move beyond some of these unique events of last year, certain challenges remain. In the U.S., our turnaround initiatives to reignite momentum are in progress. Mike Andres and the U.S. leadership team are implanting a new or nimble organizational structure that places decision-making back in the hands of the local market teams. The U.S. business is working aggressively to implement these changes, but it will take time before we see the benefits in the segment's overall financial results.\nIn Russia, while all of our restaurants impacted by the temporary closures are back in operation. The market remains in a recession and the economic outlook is weak. More broadly, consumer confidence across most of Europe is forecasted to remain low throughout 2015.\nIn APMEA, in response to the supplier issue, customer recovery efforts initiated in September in each of our impacted market, while sales trends in China showed signs of improvement during the fourth quarter. Our best estimate is that it will take at least three to six more months for our business in china to return to a normalized level.\nFor McDonald's Japan, recovery from the supplier issue has not been as strong. At the same time, new consumer perception issues have emerged, which have further depressed sales and profitability. We expect these issues to impact results for the foreseeable future. Japan remains on our priority market list.\nNext I want to provide a 2014 update and a 2015 preview for some of our key financial items; commodities, pricing, G&A, and currencies. I'll start with commodity cost for the U.S. and Europe. For the fourth quarter, U.S. commodity cost rose approximately 3.5% primarily due to higher beef prices. For the full year, commodity cost ended up about 3%, which was the upper end of our forecast, as reductions in other commodities were more than offset by increases in beef. Commodity cost pressure is expected to continue into 2015 with the full year increase projected at 1.5% to 2.5%; again, driven primarily by beef.\nExcluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up 1% for the fourth quarter, and were relatively flat for the full year. For 2015, our full year outlook is for Europe's grocery basket to also reflect an increase of 1.5% to 2.5%. To help offset this pressure, we have taken some price increases. The U.S. ended 2014 with pricing abruptly 1.8%, notably lower than the 2013 increase of about 3%, and lower than food away from home inflation, which ended the year at 3%.\nDuring the second half of the year, we consciously did not completely offset the prior year price increases that rolled off. This further pressured our margins during the third and fourth quarter. And based on where we stand at the start of 2015, we expect this pressure to continue in the near-term.\nOur price increases in Europe vary by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year. Consolidated G&A increased 9% in constant currencies for the fourth quarter, and 5% in constant currencies for the year. For the quarter, these increases were driven largely by cost associated with positioning our U.S. business for the future as well as cost related to our long-term growth initiatives.\nAs I mentioned in October, during 2014, we identified $100 million of G&A savings in the U.S. incorporates. These savings are being redirected toward our critical long-term growth initiative in 2015. Our review of the corporate G&A spending was completed in December. We're nearing the completion of our full G&A review of the U.S., and we'll provide more details on these efforts later this quarter.\nWhile our G&A increased for both periods in 2014, I want to emphasis an important point. McDonald's operates in a pay-for-performance culture. As such, short-term incentive pay outs for 2014 were zero for all corporate and U.S. employees. In addition, 2014 performance negatively impacted management's long-term incentive compensation.\nWe expect 2015 G&A to increase 7% to 8% in constant currency primarily due to the restoration of incentive pay. EXCLUDING incremental incentive base compensation 2015 G&A is expected to increase 1% to 2%. More than 100% of this remaining increase relates to costs associated with the expansion of our strategic growth initiatives, including Experience of the Future and our digital strategy.\nForeign currencies proved to be another headwind in 2014 with translation negatively impacting fourth quarter EPS by $0.08, and full year EPS by $0.12. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all major foreign currencies, we expect a negative translation in first quarter 2015 of $0.10 per share and a full year impact of $0.35 to $0.40 per share. As usual, take this as directorial guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.\nFinally, I'd like to share our current capital expenditure and restaurant opening plans for the upcoming year. Our plan for 2015 capital expenditure budget is approximately $2 billion. Nearly $1 billion left in our initial capital expenditure plan last year. The decrease in our 2013 capital expenditures is driven primarily by an $800 million decrease in capital allocated to new restaurant opening. The most notable reductions will take place in market experiencing the greatest challenges.\nChina, Russia, Germany, and the U.S., our $2 billion capital budget is divided relatively evenly with approximately 1.5 year mark for new restaurant openings and the remaining $1 billion is dedicated to re investments. We continue to rigorously screen new restaurant opportunities to determine where they will generate the most attractive returns given each markets potential competitive environment and current industry dynamics.\nIn 2015, we do expect to open more than thousand McDonald's restaurants primarily in China, the U.S., Russia and France. This compares with about 1300 restaurant opening in 2014. On a net basis we expect 600 to 700 additions for the year compare with approximately 800 in 2014. The majority of our reinvestment dollars are slated for the U.S. and the Europe. Expansion of the Create Your Taste burger platforms up to 2000 restaurants in the U.S. continue to rollout. Experience of the Future in Europe accounts for majority of the reinvestment dollars.\nEarlier this year, we outlined plans for some additional opportunity to enhance shareholder value by optimizing our capital and ownership structure and scrutinizing our G&A spending. As we close out the first year of our three-year plan, I'd like to update you on our progress. During 2014, we re-franchised over 400 restaurants against our three-year target of at least 1500. In the area of G&A, we identified and redirected nearly 100 million in savings for 2015 for future long-term growth initiatives such as the digital strategy in the McDonald's' experience in the future. As always, we continue to explore additional savings opportunities.\nAs we move into 2015, we remain on track to deliver against our three year target to return 18 to $20 billion to shareholders between 2014 and 2016 in the form of dividend and share repurchases, having returned $6.4 billion to shareholders last year. We're moving forward aggressively to regain business momentum.\nTogether; our strategy, strength and structure provide the capability and opportunity for us to change the trajectory of the business and our financial performance. We're on the right path. We've made tough decisions and are holding ourselves to rigorous standards of performance and are doing more with less. As a system, our charge over the coming year is to accelerate the pace of change and elevate the overall McDonald's experience in the eyes of our customers.\nThanks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to begin the Q&A.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nChris Stent\nThanks, Pete. I'll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We'll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. The first question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJoe Buckley\nThank you. I'm going to cheat right away and ask two, but that's down from three, so I'm actually complying. A lot of the discussion of plans for the U.S., and it seems more long-term than near-term. The near-term sales results notwithstanding the slight improvement in the month of December have been so weak. I guess I'm curious what the plan is to change the trajectory of sales.\nAnd then the related question I guess is on Create Your Taste, I think when we visited the restaurant with you in your mini-meeting in December that was the sixth restaurant with Create Your Taste, now you're talking about 2000. What is making you accelerate this from a financial standpoint? How confident are you that it works? What are the economics in Create Your Taste, I guess is the basic question?\nDon Thompson\nHey, Joe, thanks for the question, questions in this case. Couple of things, what I'll do is I'll respond a little bit to the Create Your Taste piece and then I'm going to ask Mike to speak a little bit to some of those initiatives and actions that are actually in the near-term because I think that was really your question.\nRelative to Create Your Taste, please keep this in mind, we have been modeling out looking at Create Your Taste, Build Your Burger now for over three years. We started this in the innovation center. We moved it to a test restaurant in Romeoville. As you know, Joe, when we look at something we look at all aspects of the implementation, from not only the production side and the service side, to crew interactions, to consumer relevance. And so, we've been doing quite a bit in the prior years. Then we've had this in a restaurant in test in the California area, in the SoCal area. We had it in test for about another year plus.\nAlso keep in mind that we've had similar initiatives in markets outside of the U.S., markets like France on the service side of this, we've been looking at some of the digital application pieces of this in markets like Sweden. So, all of these things have come together into what we today call Create Your Taste. So as we move forward now, this is not about just having had one restaurant, this is about having three plus four-odd years of looking at a concept and various pieces of that concept coming together.\nCreate Your Taste is not just about the food from a customization and personalization perspective, it's also about the digital engagement and interaction of customers via kiosk or mobile ordering. It's also about a change relative to the interaction with our restaurant employees and how they engage and embrace the customers. It's also about the physical changes within the restaurant as well as how we present our foods, so that you can understand and see the freshness of the produce and the quality of our proteins.\nAnd so this is a much broader piece than simply about the food itself. It is about the overall experience. And so, hopefully that answers that question. I'll ask Mike to speak a little bit about some of the things taking place in the U.S. because there are quite a few relative to the near-term.\nMike Andres\nHi, Joe. As you mentioned, we're looking at our business clearly from a near-term and a longer term perspective. In the near-term, this is a market share game; it's always going to be a market share game. So we trust and we expect to see a more customized approach from our owner operators in terms of owner operator-driven business plan locally, it's based on the customer insights and the unique competitive sets in the marketplace. And these plans are going to be multilayered in nature. You'll see disruptive value. You'll see new product news. You'll see service initiatives. And then our regional management in our new structure is empowered to commit the resources to make these plans come to life.\nI don't think we underestimated the power of ownership by owner operators of their own plan to execute on it and get results that we expect to get from those marketplaces. We're also looking at our marketing approach and making sure that we're leveraging the power of the three layers of marketing. Clearly, we've got our local co-ops. We've got our national, and we also have local store marketing. And we're looking at a revamped marketing approach that better coordinates the specific roles and deliverables of our co-op marketing plans using more sophisticated analytics and data to understand the best way to approach.\nCertainly, our national messaging comes on top of it to help build our brand. We have unique relationship with our customers and the recent advertising is rekindling that relationship in a way that we've been used to over the years, and we've enjoyed. And then, the local market aspect of it is that it's been our heritage, owner operators at McDonald's being the hub of their local communities, very important to our turnaround plan as well as to local marketing store, things that they're doing to combat the guy across the street from them, that's the key to that.\nThen, we're looking at how we address the simplicity, or the complexity, I should say, of our menu. We've simplified our menu as we talked about last month. That's going into place as a matter of fact this week. It includes reduction in the EVMs, other menu items; our test market results which included faster order times and faster total times in the drive-through continue to see performance above the controls. So no single initiative is going to drive improvements, but it's all these working together and things that will create a differentiated customer experience that our customers will notice. So we're looking at the U.S., there's 22 different regions, as you know there is multiple markets within those regions. We're already seeing pockets of success and expect those pockets of success to grow. And then, parallel to this short-term we're looking at a longer term, refining our plans to make comprehensive changes that create an enhanced experience for the customers and continue to differentiate McDonald's from the other QSRs.\nSo, Don talked about CYT; you asked about it, that is only one element of this refined experience. It is comprehensive in nature. We are calling it the Experience of The Future, we're co-creating this with our owner operators, and we'll present the plan to all of our owner operators at a National Meeting in March. And right after that, we'll start aggressively expanding that up to 2000 stores in 2015.\nChris Stent\nOkay. Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nKaren Holthouse\nHi, thank you for taking the question. So we've seen pretty meaningful pressure on margins in the fourth quarter this year and even if the commodity outlook into '15 is fairly muted, we are starting to see sort of on a more macro level, some signs of QSR wages re-inflating. Is that something you're also seeing in your system and assuming that is a factor in 2015 how should we think about company's philosophy of accepting that pressure versus passing it on and then on the franchise side really their ability to accept that pressure versus need to pass it on?\nPete Bensen\nHey, Karen, it's Pete. As we've talked a lot over these last couple of years, margins are such a top line game for us. So, very critical in the margin area that the plans and initiatives that Mike talked about, especially in the U.S. start to gain momentum and get that traction back on the top line.\nHaving said that, we are in a relatively low inflation environment, so pricing as I noted in my commentary, pricing will still be probably below our average if you assume the low inflationary environment continues. At the same time, multiple states are increasing minimum wages. We've got National Healthcare impacting 2015 for the first time. That's going to hit the McOpCo margin for about 20 basis points.\nSo I think the margin in the U.S. will continue to be a little bit pressured by the combination of less price flexibility and few of these costs, but long-term as the sales get back on track and start to grow, that is what will allow us to start to see the margin leverage. And the same dynamics are impacting franchisees restaurants as well. As they start to grow guest counts and cash flow, they will start to offset some of these pressures.\nChris Stent\nNext question is from David Palmer of RBC.\nDavid Palmer\nThanks, good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about Europe; my greatest area of curiosity lies with really the heart of Europe, France has been getting softer in recent months, at least I believe so. Germany has been soft for a while. It doesn't look like in those markets you're playing your B game. You've done a lot of good things there. Are consumer perceptions of McDonald's in fast food changing in Europe or is this purely an economic issue and what are the steps you're taking to restore growth? Thanks.\nDon Thompson\nThanks for the question, David. There are some positives and then there are some challengers relative to our business in Europe. Some of the positives are in 2015 we'll see -- if you look globally around the system first, you'll see some good high-yield growth. There are some parts of the Europe where we will see a little bit of high-yield growth, i.e., Germany we will see a bit projected in '15 and in U.K. we will see a bit.\nFrance is a more difficult market. France is actually projected to have some high-yield decline. We have been gaining our market share in both France and the U.K. despite some of the difficult broader business or macro environments. Germany, we've lost some share, and we talked about Germany as a priority market. What I will tell you is that as a priority market there were a number of changes that Germany has implemented. Some of those I spoke to relative to the actual team that we have there, our marketing leadership there; actually our agency, we changed out the agency in Germany. We're seeing a collaboration with the franchisees that is much stronger. So we're making some positive moves in our marketing plans, our menu plans. And we're seeing some changes relative to how we're addressing the consumers in those markets.\nSo I'm feeling as -- I mentioned Germany had a -- it seems to be we're seeing some recovery in Germany. We're cautious as we say it, because there are some challenges across Europe as we all know right now relative to the Euro itself. But we are seeing some positive things there. But I would tell you it's broadly economic in many of the markets with the exception of Germany where we have some things to do in terms of our own internal plans, but for many of the other markets we're gaining share or we're at a point where our businesses are continuing to compete on par with our competition there. So it will be primarily an economic piece relative to Europe.\nChris Stent\nNext question; Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.\nJeff Farmer\nThanks. Just following up on an earlier question, what level of same-store sales growth do you guys need in both the U.S. and Europe segments to hold on to restaurant level margins in '15? And you touched on it, but do you have any opportunities in the shorter term to control some of your potential cost on -- you mentioned labor, but some of the other cost on the restaurant level line?\nPete Bensen\nJeff, historically we've talked about a 2% to 3% -- I'm sorry, 2% to 3% comp needed to maintain margins in the U.S., and again that's been modeled in what we called a normal year. So when you have normal commodity inflation, normal price elasticity and ability to raise prices normal wage inflation et cetera. So a lot of those variables are a little bit out of whack for 2015. So the prices I already addressed we don't see getting to our historical levels. Wages will probably grow a little faster than normal, especially if you throw in the healthcare impact of that. So again as we think about it, especially in this first half of the year U.S. margin will continue to be a little bit under pressure.\nChris Stent\nNext question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.\nDavid Tarantino\nHi, good morning. A couple of questions, Pete, around financial strategies; and I guess first as you get into the re-franchising program that you mentioned, are you finding opportunities to potentially go deeper and I guess the big picture question is could you take the system to a much higher franchise percentage overtime, say into the 90s or even approaching a 100% of that even practical or are you thinking about it differently. And then maybe a second part of the financial question would be, are there ways to go deeper on some of the G&A cuts. I know you're reallocating a $100 million but are there other opportunities that you're seeing that might be able to sort of limit the increases that you'll see this year and into next year.\nPete Bensen\nThanks, David. First, on the re-franchising, we started out with our guidance we said at least 1500 restaurants. And we feel comfortable in being able to accomplish that over the next three years. I'll tell you the dialog with the area-of-the-world Presidents has increased around the re-franchising and the benefit that, that can bring to the overall business. So we're not committing to a new target by any means but we also said that after that three year period franchising will continue to be something that we look at and go after. So a 100% we will never be but certainly the ability to continue to increase that franchise percentage overtime is something that we will look at.\nYes. On the G&A side, I think we've been fairly consistent since we announced our plans for the savings that we believe there are significant growth opportunities available in this McDonald's Experience of The Future. And in fact since we first started talking about it, we've gotten a little bit more aggressive in our plans to go after that in 2015. So, for the short-term you heard us say we don't think we can cut our way to growth in the G&A area and we recognized these are fairly amount of resources we are reinvesting, but we believe that it's right for the long-term benefit of the business as Mike said to, we kind of change the customer experience in the McDonald's restaurants, and as we think about reallocating kind of growth resources by cutting over 800 million of capital allocated to new restaurant openings and redirecting it towards the McDonald's Experience of The Future, we think that's an appropriate and prudent thing to do in this environment.\nChris Stent\nNext question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nDon Thompson\nJohn, you there?\nJohn Glass\nYes. Can you hear me okay?\nPete Bensen\nYes. We can hear you now.\nJohn Glass\nOkay, thanks. Could you just clarify if the reduction in CapEx is a one-year reduction or you view this as the new run rate, and what happens to this windfall, is it upside to $18 billion to $20 million return, or you're just making up for the shortfall in the cash flow of the business in the last year or so? And then Mike, can you just talk about the pricing; I think you said in menu item reductions where are you in that process, is it hurting sales, have you find it actually as sales neutral, the same thing for the pricing adjustment, I think you talked about maybe lowering or adjusting prices, is it possible to actually see menu pricing going negative as a result of that?\nPete Bensen\nAll right, John. I will take the first half and Mike will take the second half. So the cut down to 2 billion, that's not a formative run rate. I mean in these markets that we described, you heard us talk about the growth opportunities that exist in these markets is a, I'd call it a relatively shorter term re-adjustment as we face the realities of the business environment we are operating in. And so, think about it as this is 2015 only and as we move throughout the year and regain that momentum that Don talked about, we'll start to realize where the capital will go in 2015, but keeping that balance between investing in the Experience of the Future and the appropriate level of new restaurant openings, and think about all of this in our $18 billion to $20 billion target.\nDon Thompson\nJohn, one of the things, and I know there has been a couple of questions around this. We firmly believe based upon the strength of our business and the reach of our business, as you all know we touch about 70 million customers a day. One of the things that we've not leveraged strongly has been the whole digital engagement aspect. So as we embarked upon the digital strategy, we knew we were embarking upon something that was going to require us to make substantial investments to get it up to par, to be able to have mobile ordering and mobile payment to be able to have promotional offerings that really, really were relevant to customers today across all age ranges. And so, we've made substantial investments there.\nOur focus now is to focus on that in-restaurant experience of our existing base. So we can improve upon on this, whether that's digital engagement, the physical assets themselves, the way the restaurants look, the placement of kiosk in the restaurants, our food offerings in the restaurants, that is where we're making substantial investments. This is not that much different. When we decided that we were going to focus on McCaf\u00e9 at one point, pull back some of the new store capital at that time and reinvested it back in existing restaurants. And so, we are doing something very similar as we look at the digital strategy, the in-restaurant experience, and the Create Your Taste and food experiences in the restaurant. And so, as we look at this we will continue to look at our expenditures both internally and externally, but we will also be mindful where we have opportunities in some of the markets to grow as those markets return to the level of growth and the level of, I'd say, stability that we think is going to be needed for us to be able to continue on new development strategies in some of those markets.\nMike, if you would, a little bit on the menu.\nMike Andres\nYes. So, John, the menu rationalization that is being rolled out as we speak, we are expecting to see the same results that we saw in the test markets which included, obviously it would be a throughput improvement because we're making it easier to order for our customers, plus complexity in the kitchen so the time to get that out the kitchen and through the windows increases. So we're seeing an improved sales result against the control markets and our test to expect to see that happen in the rest of the country.\nI did not speak specifically about pricing but did speak about value and that the markets are clearly more targeted in terms of the efforts around value and competitive threats within the marketplaces. So we're seeing more aggressive disruptive value offers in the marketplaces. As a matter of fact we are moving to a strategy of more flexibility for the local markets to price dollar menu and more which is complementing their other value messages so the level of aggressive and the tactics can be more reflective of the customer expectations, the specific competitor activity and the economic realities of niche market.\nChris Stent\nNext question; Keith Siegner of the UBS.\nKeith Siegner\nThanks, and I want to ask a question about Japan and I realize that it's a relatively small percentage of the overall operating profits but it's having a material impact on results and we've talked about the strategic rationale for this in the past and Pete what you told us is keeping that ownership percentage was important because it let you influence that business and help to improve it. We've had years of negative same-store sales including unit closures. You just mentioned that you expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. Is the plan in -- or do we, since you're there to help influence it do we need like a wholesale restating of the brand at this point? Where do we go with Japan? Thanks.\nPete Bensen\nKeith, I think that's a fair question. If you think of us the unforeseen event over the last let's say six months, it's had a significant impact on the consumer perception of the brand in Japan and frankly there were some concerns about the consumer perception of the brand before these incidents and so to your point I think there is an opportunity here and talking with the APMEA leadership and the Japan leadership the recognition that there's kind of a clean sheet of paper approach to take a look at what we're doing with our brand positioning there and how we connect with the consumer so we can improve the trends in our business there overtime.\nChris Stent\nNext question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.\nWill Slabaugh\nYeah, thanks guys, I wondered if you can talk a little bit more about the simplification of the menu and I know you've mentioned that it's happening right now, wondered if you could talk about how much further you'd be willing to go assuming you do see some improvement here and if you think there will be much more room to take more off of the menu? And then if you can sort of contrast that with any potential new menu items that you may introduce and where they may fall in terms of premium versus value?\nMike Andres\nThanks, Will. I think this menu rationalization process is clearly ongoing as we look forward we had a quite a number of products over the last 18 months or so. So we're rationalizing that looking at clearly what the customers are ordering what they expect to see. I think moving forward, one of the things that we're seeing with Create your Taste obviously that offers unlimited variety to our guest they can use whatever they like, so it takes some of the pressure off of lot of the other menu items that we would have on showing on the menu at any given time.\nIn terms of the overall menu pipeline and what we're looking at today, obviously food is a high priority for me personally. I think that's the foundation of where we're taking the business looking forward and what the expectations of the consumer are. So we're seeing this localization of what more locally relevant products that are being drawn or pulled from the marketplace as they get into the customer insights. We're looking at building our culinary talent to support our talented U.S. chefs. We're including our supplier team of chefs. We got some outside consultants who will bring a fresh and forward thinking perspective on our menu vision.\nWe've got looking at educating America on our food, so this conversation about Our Food, Your Question, giving them facts. We've seen 20 million hits on YouTube, 4.1 billion on Media Impression, so that's resonating with our consumers and it's about the quality story. We have to make sure that our quality aligns with the consumers' definition of quality moving forward. So we're going to be very aggressive in that area looking at -- we're working with our own operators to revise our product vision for a very different future, as led by the consumer from the provenance to the label ingredients, to the processes we use to bring the food from farm to table. We've opportunities to clean up our ingredient list and enhance the taste.\nAnd as you mentioned, a lot of innovation going on, including Create Your Taste, we're evolving on menu in response to a lot of the consumer trends. We are launching new products at a national level this year, and we're complementing that on differentiated products at a local level. That's a mission allowing the marketplaces to address the specific and the regional taste that exists out there today, so, a lot of new products news to see in the coming year, and news on our food, in general.\nChris Stent\nNext question; Matt DiFrisco of Buckingham Research.\nQ \u2013 Katherine Heng\nHi, this is Katherine for Matt. Can you talk about your comparable GAAP between your December same-store sales to the QSR; overall QSR sandwich category? And also the second part of the question is regarding your Create Your Taste. Can you comment on this any incremental traffic that you're seeing with the customization? Is it adding another level of complexity to the operations; any effect on the speed of service. Thank you.\nMike Andres\nRegarding the comp GAAP, clearly, that is an important metric for us to follow and certainly with high awareness of that in our market places today. So we're seeing that -- we're confronted with some inflationary pressures at the \u2013 they're well-documented. And I think we kind of lost our focus on the customer relative the values are the comp competition became more aggressive. So we're seeing that gap start to improve the less negative of course that gap varies by market place. We have markets that actually have a positive comp GAAP. So obviously we're learning from the things that are happening in those markets. But as I mentioned our plans and our tactics in each market, they've got multiple layers, which include proactive and reactive targeted tactics against specific competitor activity.\nPete Bensen\nSpecifically that the GAAP for December was 4.1, negative 4.1.\nDon Thompson\nRelative to Create Your Taste, clearly, we're seeing positive results. We have Australia at a point that, by year end they will implement nearly 900 restaurants on the platform. And again it's a much more integrated platform. It encompasses service, it encompasses multiple order points so the kiosk applications, mobile applications those things as well as being able still approach the business in a traditional sense from through the front counter or through drive-through.\nWe are looking at all aspects of how we bring this new food offering and customer choice and customization to all the customers who want to experience McDonald's. So we're seeing some positives in the market, clearly otherwise we would not be implementing this. I'd tell you that from a service perspective no matter what you implement throughout the years in the McDonald's system initially what you're going to see is a slight service increase or decrease, I would say, in terms of the effectiveness of us being able to serve any initial month or two. And then that should come right back and we should be able to be even more efficient. That is the same thing that we're seeing with Create Your Taste thus far. So thus far we're very positive on create your taste. But we're also mindful that we need to do this the right way. So we're not rushing to try to implement to the U.S. over one or two year period.\nWe're looking at the application to make sure that they give the impact that we want from a guest count, a sale and an average check perspective, which is also a huge aspect, as well as the halo around the freshness of our food and all of our problems. So, we're excited about what we see thus far. But we're also cautious about how we continue to implement this across the year.\nChris Stent\nAll right. Next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.\nQ \u2013 Sara Senatore\nThank you very much. Two follow ups; the first is on Create Your Taste and what you're seeing in Australia. I think one of the differences is certainly for example, is France, we have had some nice success with some of these initiatives. Is that the dine-in traffic or the dine-in is a much stronger portion in the U.S. So I guess the first question is are these kinds of initiatives last relevant in the U.S. because just to mix of your business so much they goes to the drive-through or even carryout.\nAnd then, the second question I wanted to ask is a follow-up on the -- you're trying about improving the quality halo and the providence. When I look at the competitive set, you know what I'd call traditional QSRs, there are some that are doing quite well without any of that \u2013- with I think just sort of a core competency around speed and service. Mike, be you could talk about diagnosing that while some of your very direct competitors seems to be doing well even in the absence of fitting in with some of these trends about quality and provenance and the sort of the fast casual direction. Thanks.\nDon Thompson\nOkay, I'll take both parts. On the first part, relative to Create Your Taste in different dynamics or better experience of the future in difference dynamics because what France is doing is not an implementation of Create Your Taste at this point. They have implemented multiple order points and now you can place an order through the kiosk, front counter, table counter, web ordering etcetera, mobile ordering. And when you look at the table service in France, yes, there is a strongest queue to end store versus drive-through.\nHowever, I will tell you this, what we do is look at things like that and we will tailor those based upon the markets that we're implementing it. We already know that in the U.S. with the restaurant today implementing Create Your Taste that we're seeing very positive results. Therefore what we're doing is pulling customers who have a little bit more time and want experience the restaurant inside to come inside the restaurant. We make tremendous investments in terms of re-imaging and actually we have more customers that are seeing those investments in this environment and would be offering a Create Your Taste.\nSo they will be modeled for the various markets around the world based upon what is going to appeal the customer the most. France will not be implementing Create Your Taste that the same taste, to say, Australia has. Australia is at a different point with regard to -- say we're bordering them. France has been. We'll take -- We will learn from all of those things as we bring this forward. But nonetheless Create Your Taste; table service in France, kiosk applications across Europe, all of those things have been successful for and really the experience of the future aspect holds them all together. And so you know the season variations across the market. But clearly, we'll look at the performance metrics to make sure we move forward effectively.\nThis is not unlike, again, McCaf\u00e9 was very different in Australia than it is in the U.S., yet and still McCaf\u00e9 has worked in both. On the other side, relative to traditional QSR's, I'd offer this; no one is really shining that brightly relative to the traditional QSR space. I think what we're talking about at McDonald's is appealing more to the consumers that are out there, that are high-yield customers. So it's not about a QSR thing or fast casual thing. It's about this taste in food. It's about affordability. It is about transparency as a brand. It's about a great service experience that gives them a choice. Those are the things that we're putting in place. Those are the things that will help us prepare all those business and moving forward.\nSo we're not gauging ourself by other QSR's as you were. We're gauging ourselves by the market opportunity and we want to do that. I would also tell you that as we look forward at the markets around the world, each of those markets that we said today, is very different and at different places. So they will be able to bring the experience of the future to light in their market relative to their customer basis. But we're not skipping over the existing execution of the core products that we have, the core menu that we have, core service expectation, quality, service, cleanliness, those things are important in every single market we have around the world today.\nChris Stent\nWe're out of time. So I'll turn it over to Don, who has a few closing comments.\nDon Thompson\nLet me just make a couple of comments because they came up a couple of times about our franchisee and thoughts about -- someone mentioned something relative to implementation of franchisees and they thought about it. I have to tell you in the last couple of years as we've said have been difficult, but as a global system, all of our system has experienced quite a bit and endured many unforeseen changes in the local market. But at the same time, we've charted and began to implement a stronger pathway for future growth.\nI couldn't be more proud of the franchisees we have around the world. They own and operate 81% of our restaurants, and without them we would not have been able to endure those things which we have over the last couple of years. Well, there was geopolitical issues, some food-related issues, our franchisees along with the employees and suppliers have done a tremendous job, and it's that strength that is going to propel us forward, if that unmentioned strength if you would, we don't often talk about when we talk about the financials, but it's one of the things that made McDonald's special and it is one of the things that will fuel our growth as we move forward.\nI want to thank all of you for joining us on the call today. 2015, as we say, will be a year of regaining momentum. We're making progress as we move even closer to our customers and as we change to be relevant and more progressive, modern service, genuine hospitality, personal engagement, more relevant customized menus, and a brand that people can trust, truly trust, this is the McDonald's Experience of the Future. It is the path that we are forging, and I would tell you that the future is already on its way.

Following today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.\nBrad Whitmarsh\nThanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us for our first quarter conference call. I hope you've had a chance to review the news release and presentation deck that we published this morning. These materials are available on the Investors page of our website and they highlight strong first quarter performance versus expectations. Later today, we plan to file our 10-Q with the SEC.\nI want to remind everyone that today's discussion contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as, certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. Following our prepared remarks, we will hold the question-and-answer session. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up and we plan to wrap up in under an hour.\nOur planned comments this morning will come from Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; as well as Brent Smolik, President and COO; Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Hodge Walker, SVP of Onshore; and Keith Elliott, SVP of Offshore are here to participate in the Q&A session.\nWith that, I'll turn the call to Dave.\nDave Stover\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.\nI'm excited to share with you a number of accomplishments already realized during the first quarter, including driving sustainable capital and cost savings and quarterly production ahead of expectations. In fact, our first quarter net organic cash flow was significantly better than the plan we outlined last quarter.\nIn the earnings release and slides, we have provided detailed information to illustrate our strong level of execution from the beginning of the year. For the third quarter in a row, our total capital came in below expectations with first quarter capital below the low end of the range, due to lower well and facility costs and lower Leviathan spend.\nDespite the reduction in capital, we delivered sales volumes above the upper end, upper range of guidance. Operating costs also came in below expectations and these per barrel efficiencies will drive further improvements in profitability.\nGoing into this year, we set out to drive sustainable cash flow growth by challenging the organization to reduce the capital intensity of our business and deliver more for the same or less capital. As we continue to progress through the year, we expect to build upon these capital efficiency gain. I can say that we're off to a great start with better operational efficiencies across all three onshore basins. Brent will discuss this in more detail, but I'm pleased with the execution of our onshore teams and the efficiency results.\nThe leadership focus on innovation and continuous improvement, creates the opportunity to decrease the long-term capital needs for the company. Despite the acceleration in oil prices through the first quarter, we remain disciplined.\nOur plan was set at a $50 WTI oil price for 2019. We are committed to operate within our budget of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. And as I stated on the year-end call, as commodity prices move higher, we expect to have the ability to further strengthen the balance sheet and return additional cash flow to investors.\nIn the DJ Basin, our business continues to outperform our expectations. Last month, Colorado passed Senate Bill 181, which provides additional oversight for oil and gas activity at the local level. Through the strategic repositioning of our acreage and state approval of our comprehensive drilling plan, we're well positioned to work with both state and local authorities. We have line of sight to years of activity and are set to execute on our multi-year plan and to build upon our industry-leading returns in the basin.\nIn Texas, the Delaware Basin has maintained production and growing cash flow, despite a lower activity level and capital outlay for the last three quarters. Our Eagle Ford operations continue to benefit from better base production performance as well as the initial tranche of ducts coming online.\nAs our U.S. onshore completion activity picks up in the second quarter, we are positioned for a pronounced second half volume ramp, while capital spending trends lower throughout the year.\nBefore we move to the international assets, I'd like to take a minute to discuss Noble Midstream. Operationally NBLX had another strong quarter. Their service and support of Noble's activities in the DJ and Delaware Basins has been a key to our success.\nThe NBLX team has built a strong asset base and third-party businesses in both basins. They recently announced the addition of three very attractive assets the EPIC Y-grade and crude interests and the Delaware Crossing pipeline to Wink Texas, which support Permian growth, while assisting our upstream development.\nYou may have seen that we filed an 8-K last week to disclose an ongoing strategic review of our midstream assets. This is consistent with our earlier disclosures and our practice of continually evaluating all options to create an increase value.\nOur midstream assets within Noble and NBLX are very valuable. And we do not believe this is sufficiently reflected by the markets for either entity. As we evaluate potential scenarios, we will keep in mind the investor sentiment around MLP structure and IDRs. I won't speculate on the potential outcomes. However, Noble as the largest unit holder in NBLX has a vested interest in the success of both entities.\nTurning to our international business. We outlined goals this year to maximize cash flows of our existing businesses, while progressing our major project developments that Leviathan and Alen. Operationally, it was a strong quarter for both our Equatorial Guinea and Israel operations.\nIn the Eastern Med, volumes continue to outperform through higher domestic demand. With Leviathan now 81% complete, the project remains on time and on budget. With the platform, getting ready to set sail in the summer.\nBringing Leviathan online, will provide another source of gas in the growing domestic and regional demand centers. In West Africa, the team delivered volumes above expectations. We sanction the Alen gas monetization project, which we see as the first step in creating an offshore natural gas hub in the area.\nI'm excited about the potential for decades of incremental sustainable cash flow through the backlog of discovered resources in this area. With Leviathan and Alen, Noble Energy has a unique opportunity to access global natural gas markets and drive further high margin, cash flow growth internationally.\nOver the last few years, we've also been focused on building an exploration portfolio of high quality drilling opportunities. Our teams have targeted matured low cost material opportunities both on and offshore. I'm excited to be able to talk about our recent entry in Colombia, where we are operator with 40% working interest on two offshore blocks with Shell. We will likely test a prospect in 2020.\nAdditionally, our onshore exploration team has captured over 140,000 acres of low cost material exploration inventory in two Wyoming basins. In 2020 consistent with our multi-year plan, our offshore and onshore exploration programs will begin to test up to 1 billion barrels of net risked exploration inventory.\nOverall, I'm extremely pleased with how the company has started 2019. We are well on our way to accomplishing the goal set out earlier this year. We're focused on three key drivers of shareholder value to position Noble as an attractive investment across all sectors.\nThese are; number one, generating a competitive free cash flow yield with significant return to investors; two, maintaining a strong balance sheet; and three, delivering a 5% to 10% long-term annual production growth rate supplemented by periodic additions of the major projects.\nIn addition, our high return, high quality opportunities I'm sure our investments drive increasing corporate returns. We are uniquely positioned to our low decline production base and high return opportunity set to deliver these outcomes and create sustainable value growth and return to investors.\nOver time, we plan to grow the dividend with cash flows and provide additional opportunistic shareholder returns. To that end, we recently announced an increase to the quarterly dividend of 9%, reflecting the confidence in our cash flow outlook.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Brent Smolik, our President and COO, to talk about the operations and the efficiencies gained already in 2019.\nBrent Smolik\nThanks Dave, and good morning, everyone.\nAs Dave mentioned, the first quarter was a strong start to 2019, with good execution globally, across our operations. Our U.S. Onshore business improved capital efficiency coming in under budget on capital and above on first quarter production volumes.\nOn the international side, the quarter was equally rewarding, where we continue to produce above expectations, progressed Leviathan 81% completion and sanction the Alen gas monetization project.\nSo I'll begin - little deeper dive this morning with the U.S. Onshore on Slide 5. Our key operational focus in this part of our business has been to improve execution and capital efficiencies. While still early in the year, I'm happy to report that we've made significant strides to streamline cost, create more efficient well designs and increase our pace of execution.\nWe've accelerated our completion tempo across all three basins with meaningful gains in completion stages per day and total pumping hours per day, while decreasing the transition time between frac stages. The frac hours pump per day increased 5% to 10% in the DJ, Permian and Eagle Ford versus Q4 '18 and that's a meaningful improvement in the quarter.\nOur teams also continued to improve drilling efficiencies and delivered a best-in-class pacesetter Permian well in 16 days from spud to rig release for nearly 10,000 foot lateral. In the DJ Basin Row 2 wells at Mustang were drilled 10% faster than Row 1 wells, as we leverage learnings from the 2018 drilling campaign.\nThere is a cost benefit to those efficiency gains and there is a production benefit because new wells are brought online ahead of schedule. And I expect that momentum to continue in the second quarter. While these results were a good start and we're continuing to look for ways to capture further savings and improved returns.\nFor example, in the DJ Basin, we continue to test and evaluate frac designs, employing lower fluid volumes, which reduces the pumping time per stage. Successful application of this design can sustainably reduce capital costs and improve well returns. We also plan to test this concept in other basins.\nThese capital improvements and reduce cycle times puts Noble in a great position to either complete our planned activities quicker for less capital or accomplish more activity within the approved 2019 capital budget. Either option is a positive outcome. We also continue to closely monitor service cost and year-to-date, we've not experienced inflationary pressure in any category in the U.S. Onshore.\nTurning specifically to the DJ Basin. Over the past several years, Noble has strategically positioned itself within the basin, we built a high quality contiguous acreage position, which allows for optimal development and we're seeing the results of those efforts.\nIn the first quarter, the DJ generated record production of 144,000 barrel equivalents per day, up 21% versus the first quarter of 2018. The efforts of our teams to create offtake optionality are paying off by improving the reliability and predictability of gas in NGL sales volumes. This exceptional performance has allowed the DJ to generate cash flow in excess of capital spend and we expect this trend to continue as we efficiently develop the asset.\nDuring the quarter, we brought online our initial wells from the second row of Mustang, which brings Row 1 and Row 2 to nearly 50,000 barrel equivalents per day of gross production and just nine months from the startup of Row 1. These 21 wells were drilled and completed faster than Row 1, an early production trends are in line with Row 1.\nWith more than half the 29 activity focus in Mustang, we're encouraged that our program will continue to deliver on expectations. As we expected and guided the wells in the western portion of Row 2 produce with higher gas oil ratios. Going forward, we expect the GORs to decrease as we move east and north in the DJ development.\nIn the second quarter, we'll will have the highest number of TILs planned in the DJ Basin supporting second half 2019 production growth. The company still plans to operate one to two rigs and two frac crews and bring 95 to 100 wells online in the DJ this year.\nIn the Delaware Basin, production was essentially flat with Q4, despite the announced divestiture and a low TIL count in the first quarter. Well performance remained strong bringing online nine wells with an average 30-day rate of over 1,500 barrel oil equivalents per day. Two of the nine wells were in the Southwest portion of our position adjacent to the recently divested acreage. Excluding those two wells, the average new well production was over 200 barrel equivalents per day for per 1,000 foot of lateral.\nAs we move forward this year, our near-term plans are primarily focused on executing row style development in our core Reeves County acreage position near our central gathering facilities. We anticipate further improvements as we bring 15 to 20 wells online in Q2. The timing of the second quarter TILs will contribute significantly to third quarter production growth, which aligns well with our EPIC early crude service.\nThe Permian basins received some recent attention regarding gas transportation and WAHA spot pricing and that issue, does not have a meaningful impact on Noble for several reasons; Permian gas only makes up approximately 1% of our company revenues; we have a firm gas sales agreement in place to move 100% of our gas and NGL volumes out of the basin; and we've had 75% of our 2019 and 2020 WAHA basis.\nIn the Eagle Ford, we generated significant asset level free cash flow last year and we plan to continue harvesting cash this year. Late in the first quarter, we brought online seven DUCs and thanks to our improved cadence of operations, we've accelerated additional TILs into the second quarter.\nWe anticipate a slight increase in production volumes in the second quarter before stepping up in the third quarter as a remainder of our DUC inventory comes online. Overall, we're pleased with Q1 performance in the U.S. Onshore business.\nNow shifting to offshore. We continue to see strong performance from our producing assets with a great quarter from both Eastern Med and West Africa. In Israel, Tamar continue to exhibit why it's a world-class natural gas asset, again produced a record volumes of over a Bcf per day gross production in Q1.\nAnd the second quarter, we expect slightly lower volumes due to some holiday seasonality, and then we expect third quarter production to be similar to Q1. We expect Tamar production to be essentially flat to 2018 or said another way, no base decline year-over-year.\nAs Dave mentioned, the Leviathan project is now 81% complete and we achieved a few key milestones in the quarter. We completed the jacket installation, the subsea manifold installation and the subsea pipeline installations as we continue to derisk the project.\nThe next major operational milestone will be the delivery of the production deck, which is scheduled for mid-year. From a marketing standpoint, the key near-term focus is the EMG pipeline, which will facilitate natural gas sales into Egypt. We're diligently progressing this project and we plan to flow test with gas and complete inspection this month.\nFollowing the flow test, we expect to close on the pipeline purchased by mid-year. What's operational, the pipeline will primarily allow for gas sales from Leviathan and will provide flexibility for gas sales from Tamar.\nAs we've communicated previously, we expect to sell an average of 800 million cubic feet a day from Leviathan in 2020. We anticipate significant regional demand growth and we're excited that the Noble EMEA gas can satisfy a portion of that growing demand. In West Africa, the sanction of the Alen gas monetization project was the major highlight for the quarter.\nThe declining production from the Alba field creates capacity at the existing putting Europe plant infrastructure and that capacity creates an unique opportunity to extend the life of the Alba field and to monetize the Alen gas, it's currently re-injected for pressure maintenance. The project capital is estimated to be $165 million net to Noble and we expect the initial sales of LNG and incremental liquids in the first half of 2021.\nThe economics benefit from global LNG pricing and the project is a significant step forwards towards monetization of over three Tcf of discovered gas in the area. It's also important to note that the governments of E.G. and Cameroon recently completed a pre-unitization agreement, which will further support development of discovered resources.\nIn the second quarter, we plan to spud the Aseng 6P well, which will further mitigate production declines and assist in reservoir management. This well is expected to begin drilling in June and be online in the third quarter.\nNow let me provide some guidance for the second quarter, which is still in line with our previous plans. Capital for the quarter is estimated to be in a range of $675 million to $750 million, with most of the capital spend in the U.S. Onshore and the Eastern Med regions.\nTotal company sales volumes in the second quarter expected to be between 332,000 and 347,000 barrels oil equivalent, reflecting increasing U.S. Onshore volumes and essentially flat international production. Internationally, we expect our Israel volumes to be down slightly in the second quarter due to Israeli holidays and West Africa volume should increase slightly due to plant Alba maintenance, which was completed in the first quarter, right at the end of March. Full-year production and capital guidance remain unchanged.\nBefore I wrap up my commentary, I want to just reiterate how pleased I'm with our operational performance and execution. Across our U.S. Onshore and international assets, we saw higher production and a path to lower sustainable cost and we expect to drive efficiencies further across our organization. I expect this operational momentum to continue into the second quarter and throughout the year, as we bring online our highest TIL count in 2019 and the onshore ramp up in the back half of the year.\nIn West Africa, the Alen gas monetization project will add to the low decline production base and free cash flow profile of our company. And in Colombia, we finalize the exploration opportunity as we seek to build out our inventory of discovered offshore resources.\nSlide 15, summarizes some of our Q1 accomplishments and other key 2019 deliverables, which are leading us to year-end and to the defining moment of Leviathan first production.\nWe'll now open the line for questions. Operator?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrian Singer\nYou highlighted a number of the cycle time in capital efficiency improvements in your comments. Do these represent the entirety of the below guidance capital spending for the first quarter or the timing of activity play a role as well? And you mentioned in your comments, Brent, I believe, that you may have a choice to make on more activity for the same budget or same activity for lower CapEx. How would you frame which route to take given the goal of free cash flow?\nBrent Smolik\nYes, let me tackle in the order you asked them. So there was a number of things that we benefited from in the first quarter from capital, we definitely have improved efficiencies or shorten cycle times and our drilling and completion and our facility activities. I might get Hodge to comment on that in a moment. But we also had different \u2013 lower discounts that we negotiated with our suppliers. And then there was primarily in the case of the Eastern Med some timing where we delayed some of the \u2013 or the spend will come in the second, third quarters as we move toward first production in Leviathan.\nBut also remember to offset that, we've accelerated effectively about four, four wells. They're not \u2013 parts of wells, but about four, four wells into the first quarter. So our savings have overcome incremental activity in the U.S. because of the efficiencies and lower cost. So and in terms of how we think about \u2013 at the asset level how we think about the incremental capital is that, if we decide to deploy it, it's going to be based on the merits of the projects that we have in front of us. So based on the safety performance, the well performance, the cost performance, the returns at the well level, we'll debate that how we allocate that capital at the well level between the assets.\nDave Stover\nAnd I think, Brian, just back up and take a higher level view of the cash flow portion, don't forget the way I've laid it out, what we're looking at on incremental cash flows continuing to strengthen the balance sheet or accelerate strengthening the balance sheet shareholder returns. We highlighted that with the dividend increase here just recently. And then we look at the activity and how that plays out.\nBrian Singer\nAnd then my follow-up is on industry consolidation and applicability to Noble as you see more of these moves here and the push for scale. Do you think Noble's Permian assets are sufficiently positioned to be industry-competitive with scale? Or do you see the opportunity and/or need to participate in consolidation in some way in the basin?\nBrent Smolik\nWell, I think what you've seen us do on the Permian was around getting the scale and consolidated position that's important. I mean, scale and especially a consolidated contiguous position in any basin is important. And I think that was a big driver that helps us to generate very competitive and our expectation drive industry-leading returns over time in the basin based on where the assets are located and how we position that.\nSo I'd say, we're very comfortable with what we have and the thought process that went into building that, and the quality of what we have, and the results we're seeing there. So I think we're in a good position there and our focus is on continuing to prove the folks that we can get more out of these assets than anybody else.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram\nI wanted to start in the Eastern Med there has been news in the press recently around Jordan and the gas price that underpins the Leviathan export contract. What are your thoughts there? And any potential risk here in terms of the Jordan contract?\nBrent Smolik\nI think you go back to the Jordan contract that's been a fully executed and binding contract. I think everything that everybody is focused on their and everybody we\u2019re engaged with has been towards moving to first production. So that's been the continued focus from our standpoint. I think there is a lot of anticipation and desire to get this thing on production, Leviathan on production and that's where we're maintaining the focus.\nArun Jayaram\nAnd then my second question is just, I was wondering, Dave if you could help us maybe frame the cash flow potential for Noble for the Alen project. And I did note that the pipe that you're building will be a pretty large pipe and what are some additional opportunities to monetize gas resources that you have in that part of the world?\nDave Stover\nYes, let me, start with that and Brent, can add anything that he wants to. But the Alen project and we rolled out with the sanction some of the parameters around that. One thing, not to forget, there's a number of thing that's important with that project. One, it's the backfill in Punta Europa on the LNG facility and the ability to move gas into a contractual arrangement that provides us access to the global LNG market and a significant portion of that value that our partnership will share in.\nThe other couple of things to it, there is also not insignificant condensed liquids volume, I'd call it condensate NGLs that will be part of this. And then the third nice value component of this, before we get into the longer-term portion, is that it extends the life of Alba and there is a nice value proposition for the Alba field itself which we get to share in obviously. The second part of that is the longer-term picture of this and we have about three Tcf of discovered gross resources in the region.\nAnd as, Alba field declines over time and more room becomes available in the plant, we'll have the ability now as you said with some of this pre-investment at very little extra cost, to size the pipe to be able to tie in these very close proximity, projects. And Brent may be able \u2013 want to talk a little bit more about how that fits going forward.\nBrent Smolik\nI think it\u2019s great summary, Dave. The only thing I might add is, if you think about we're backfilling the capacity this opening up from field decline. So to our project early on, it's going to look like a growing wedge of production and cash flows over the first few years. And then it will look like a very long-term stable set of cash flows with relatively low investment rates to bring on the discovery gas. So it's got a very appealing cash flow profile to us.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScott Hanold\nCouple things, one in the Permian Basin and appreciate giving some capital spend detail by area. It looks like Permian Basin costs have come down to maybe below $10 million, is that right? And is that something you all think could be fairly sustainable or improve going forward?\nBrent Smolik\nWe do Scott, I think your math's right. We talked about targeting $1 million to $1.5 million a well. And we're well on our way to realizing that from the combination of a faster, shorter cycle times, faster operations and lower cost. And so I think, if you think about the type well as a 7,500 foot type well you can use $9.5 million or so per well. And remember some of these will be longer laterals, quite a few will be longer laterals. So we may average above that, but we're \u2013 the message is, we're realizing the cost savings that we targeted.\nScott Hanold\nAnd then you all did identify that you've picked up some acreage in Wyoming now. And it sounds like in a couple different basins is, is there any more specifics you can get on what area you're targeting is that Powder River Basin. Is that Green River Basin, what are you all looking at up there?\nBrent Smolik\nYes, I mean we're still doing some leasing. But I can say probably little less than 50% of it in the Powder just to give you some feel. And it's probably about as far as we want to go at this point. What I'd say is we'll probably be ready. I expect we'll be ready to drill a couple wells in both basins next year, so that will give us some good insight.\nScott Hanold\nAnd I would assume you all are targeting in oil, oil play right?\nBrent Smolik\nLiquids rich plays for sure.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hall\nJust wanted to I guess maybe get a little bit - just kind of timing of TILs. I think you alluded to 15 to 20 I think in the Delaware, in the second quarter. You also had accelerated TIL schedule in the DJ relative to what we are expecting in the first quarter. And I'm just trying to think through kind of the timing of how those TILs plays out over the rest of the year and how to Q2 and compares to the second half?\nBrent Smolik\nYes, I think the best way to summarize it would be the second quarter will be our highest TIL activity for the year that's partly by design. It's also partly because of the increased pace of development this bring, some of those into the quarter.\nAnd then, remember that that there's about a quarter lag generally from when the, you know the production versus the TIL the highest TIL counts. And you can see that even in the charts that we included in the materials, you can see as our TIL count start to increase. The production picks up about a quarter or two later that we get the benefit of it. So first three quarters loaded on completion activity, back half loaded on production profile.\nMichael Hall\nAnd just to follow up on that. On the DJ, how many would you expect to see in the second quarter?\nDave Stover\n30, we're bringing on about 30 wells in the second quarter in the DJ.\nMichael Hall\nAnd that's largely and they are staying still?\nDave Stover\nThe mix of Mustang, I think we've got some East Pony wells in there also.\nMichael Hall\nAnd then I guess, I just wanted to kind of follow up a little bit on Brian's question around scale, just to make sure, I heard you right, I suppose. So like relative to the acreage position you guys - you're going to had assembled post the Clayton Williams deal, obviously with the acreage sale you highlighted this quarter and alluded to last quarter that total acreage position is down somewhat. Are you at all open to continuing to expand that position or at this point is the position as it stands today sufficient from your thinking?\nBrent Smolik\nSo, Michael, a couple of things. Just as a reminder, our current full year pace of development is 50 to 60 wells in the Permian. So we've got plenty of running room. So we don't feel compelled that we have to do something right away.\nAnd as Dave mentioned, our view on it is if we can demonstrate to ourselves into the market that we are the low cost, most efficient, highest productivity, highest per well return operator, then I think that would make sense to everybody that we would be the larger consolidator of it. And so we're not opposed to that, but if we do it, I think you - we'll make the case that we did some day would make the case to you that we're logical operator to do. But we're not compelled to do it, because we're in good shape right now.\nDave Stover\nAnd as Brent said, if we've got over a decade easily of opportunity, high quality opportunity here. And so the focus near term is on the blocking and tackling, the coring up with trades and so forth, like we've done in the DJ in and around our position. So we can have more efficient row development and longer laterals.\nMichael Hall\nOkay, clear enough. So not in a hurry today but opportunistic, if the environment presented itself.\nDave Stover\nI like it, as Brent said, you've got to earn it.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate\nI've got a couple. Couple of quick ones hopefully. Dave, you walk through your thoughts on NBLX and I understand you probably don't want to elaborate too much, but assuming you did generate a reasonable amount of cash out of that in some form or another. How would you describe your priority for use of cash in terms of whether it be buyback or other users if you could consider?\nDave Stover\nWell, yes, I'm not going to speculate obviously on anything with NBLX because all kinds of ways that can play out has a tremendous value there. But I think in general, when we look at incremental cash flow, I tie it back to what I said previously where it's accelerating strengthening of the balance sheet, returning additional value to shareholders, whether it's through dividend increase, the sustainable cash flow increases or opportunistic buybacks, things like that. And then, those are really the two at the top of the list for us.\nDoug Leggate\nI thought, I'd give a go Dave. I wonder if could just dig a little bit on the midstream, - sorry, on the cost guidance, the midstream element of this marketing. I think it's like kind of legacy liability. I wonder if I can ask, Ken, maybe just to walk us through what the mitigating options are for you to maybe eliminate that cost over trend. My guess is, it's related to some legacy Marcellus issues, but obviously there is other ways for you to offload that at some point. I just want to get a handle as to what will happen to those costs going forward?\nKen Fisher\nYes, Doug. This is Ken. In the quarter we offloaded about $350 million of transport commitment to Southwestern at about 100,000 MMBTU a day from 2021 to 2032 we recorded a liability for that of $92 million. And so that commitment and transport cost that transfers to the counterparty. So going forward, we'll continue to work that balance and probably the cost is in the range of $30 million a quarter this year of transport commitment that we'll continue to work to mitigate.\nDave Stover\nThe good news is, Doug, that a lot of that transports located in parts of the world where from time-to-time it's going to be valuable. So that's going to give us options like we had in the first quarter.\nDoug Leggate\nI appreciate that. I wonder if I could squeeze just one really last quick one. And it's just when you get the East Med gas pipeline up and running. I'm just wondering if - can you maybe give was the prognosis as to what that does to the line of sight on further expansions in Israel going forward? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nKeith Elliott\nYes, Doug. I think the way to think about the further expansions in Israel is really focused on selling out the full capacity of Leviathan. So if you think about it right now, we've kind of got the 900 million a day contracted there and that's against the 1.2 Bcf a day capacity.\nSo think about 300 million a day of essentially free capacity to be expanded by accessing additional contracts, expect those contracts are most likely you need, but certainly we're seeing demand across all three of the major markets that we're in there Israel, Jordan, as well as Egypt. So watch this space.\nDave Stover\nYes, I think, I'll just add on little. I think, as we've talked in the past. Our objective here is probably to contract maybe around 1 Bcf a day and not the full 1.2 Bcf a day. I think when Leviathan comes online, we're going to be very pleased with the fact that we've got a little more capacity there, because it will be interesting to see how quickly some of this demand ramps up pretty fast as Keith said, when you talk to the customers and you look at what's going on in the area. My expectation will see that capacity demand fill up pretty quickly after we start getting things online and get a year or so into this.\nDoug Leggate\nSeems you've got a lot of low cost options Dave, going forward to that. Thanks a lot.\nDave Stover\nThe other thing, I'd add it's very similar to the discussion we had in Alen is that we start off at an average of 800 million a day next year as that market demand grows, that's going to look like an inclining production profile and set of cash flows. So I think that's the long-term huge competitive advantage for us.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Irene Haas with Imperial. Please go ahead.\nIrene Haas\nI'm happy to see you guys going back offshore again. So I have one question on your offshore Colombia project, which is on the Caribbean coast and it comes in five parts, any existing discovery on trend? Number one, number two is this production sharing contract and what's your minimal ore commitment. How much it cost to drill the first well? And then also how many years of delineation and ultimately with the infrastructure build - would it be a FPSO type situation when it comes to development?\nDave Stover\nYes, I'm not sure, I got all of those, Irene, I'll try with some of this. But it's a - what we're excited about here is, it's a opportunity that we've been working on for a period of time here. And to get in, with a high quality partner or joint venture, co-venture as Shell, I think will work well for us. We've matured this thing enough to whether it will be ready to drill next year, probably half of the total depth is in water. So I don't remember the actual cost per se. But it's a reasonable cost for a prospect with a high geologic chance factor. I think the geologic chance factor is probably 40% or more.\nAnd so I think the big thing that we'll be looking at here is, liquid versus gas type of a thing, I think, we think there is a very good case to be made based on our regional view, our seismic understanding and some of the analysis of other items in the area that this could be a very high likelihood of an liquid project. And it creates the opportunity with success to derisk other opportunities, just like we've done in the Eastern Med and West Africa.\nSo it ties in very well with the types of things we've been successful in the past, and it gives us an opportunity for something that's relatively low risk, fairly decent chance of hydrocarbons and something that could be very material with some success here. I don't know if I answered all of those or even a part of those type of things, but that kind of explains why we're there and what we're looking for, and I'm excited to get chance to drill it next year.\nIrene Haas\nI have a follow-up. Are there any discovery of fields on trend offshore there?\nDave Stover\nNot specifically tied into this what we call this depositional environment, I think if you go further South, if I remember right. There is some gas down there. So there's hydrocarbon indicators, if you will, but based on our analysis and our thermogenic review of this and so forth. We think there is still a pretty decent likelihood that this is going to be more of a liquid play. That's our target objective.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Welles Fitzpatrick with SunTrust. Please go ahead.\nWelles Fitzpatrick\nBut I'm not going to ask on any predictions on NBLX obviously, but is there any way we could get an update on an approximate cost basis of the assets NBL given the distribution stream?\nDave Stover\nNo, I don't think here.\nWelles Fitzpatrick\nFair enough. Thought I would give it a shot.\nDave Stover\nGood try.\nWelles Fitzpatrick\nThen so Weld County on Monday they obviously move towards designating unincorporated wells as a local control County area. Does that you are you guys still looking at additional CDPs you don't already have in progress or does that basically derisk the regulatory environment enough yours acreage?\nDave Stover\nWell, I think you saw the impact of our first CDP and so we're continuing to look at, if there are some areas that makes sense to pull another CDP together. Again that really only works when you've got the highly contiguous large positions like we've pulled together over time. So I think all that work to consolidate our acreage position stay in rural areas is going to payoff significantly. As we move forward and that may provide the opportunity to have another CDP or so over time here.\nBrent Smolik\nYes this is Brent. As Dave mentioned in his in his comments, I think that our objective is to be able to extend our planning horizon, as long as we can and get ahead of any of the regulatory changes that are going on and be prepared to be able to work effectively at all levels of government and regulatory bodies.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.\nCharles Meade\nI just have one question, can you give us a little bit more detail on the quarterly CapEx specially for the Leviathan specifically I imagine that lot of the CapEx is up the 2019 CapEx is behind us with all the subsea work that's been done. But I wanted to just check, that assumption to get an idea of how it's going to progress 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q?\nDave Stover\nWe have an updated Charles on the full year yet. We guided to 500 \u2013 we commented 500 million to 550 million for the year.\nCharles Meade\nRight.\nDave Stover\nThe next big update the logical next update time would be when we install the production index. That's a big events, it\u2019s a big lift and once we get those in place. We'll have a better estimate and that'll be third quarter time we'll be able to tidy up everything for the year. But hopefully picked up on all of our comments and all phases, we're on track on the project.\nBrent Smolik\nI think, behind the scenes, some of the things are doing on the function testing, getting things ready to tie in. If you go back and remember why did tomorrow come on so well and so reliable was all the function testing that was done before you even hooked everything up on the platform. So I think we found, that's been a key in all our major projects has given that exemplary track record that Keith and his folks have been able to exhibit.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nGail Nicholson\nYour LOE we improved quarter-over-quarter. But I was curious just diving into the U.S. portion LOE what is the delta on a per BOE basis and LOE and the DJ versus the Permian. And do you think that there is more improved for LOE reduction in the Permian, as you progress in this full growth development process?\nBrent Smolik\nYes, we do - you got to keep in mind the DJ, is an older more mature development. And so we've been able to drive more efficiencies into all aspects of including the production operations. Delaware is less mature and was growing very aggressively last year and we were putting a lot of the infrastructure in place and building out the production capability last year. This year we're focused on being able to drive efficiencies through that program. So there is that difference that makes Delaware higher. And then the other differences we handle more water in the Delaware. And so, those two issues are the differentiators and the two basins cost structures.\nGail Nicholson\nAnd then my follow-up in the DJ you guys are doing in East Pony activity PILs in the second quarter. Are you guys doing anything different in the completion style design up there that previously you just kind of discuss that the East Pony?\nDave Stover\nNot really. The thing that we're looking at across the basin is the application of some lower fluid volumes per stage and some different classifiers that may have an application up there. But otherwise it's business as usual.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Nitin Kumar with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nNitin Kumar\nI just wanted to touch on the well results in the Delaware Basin this quarter, obviously a nice tick up in average productivity from the Southwest Reeves wells, you did highlight that two wells were drilled. I'm sorry the northern wells, but two wells were drilled in Southwest these were HBP they seem to be quite a bit weaker. Anything going on with the geology or the completions in that area?\nDave Stover\nYes, they weren't drilled. They were tilled there were completed and tilled so they are older wells that we've drilled that we completed in the first quarter. But yes, it's different geology, when we've talked about a fair amount when you move to the far Southwest and that's consistent with that area that we divested in the first quarter. And so it's a different performance, you can see it across all operators in the region.\nNitin Kumar\nAnd then just maybe following up on some of the other questions around Noble X. Leading aside, you mentioned the two uses of free cash flow in terms of returns to shareholders. Where does the exploration fit into that prioritization, last quarter you had mentioned about I think about $100 million to $200 million, but you'd also disclose a new play in the PRB and Wyoming. Could you help us just think about the cost involved that exploration effort?\nDave Stover\nI think it's a good question, because I don't want to leave any confusion but the exploration capital and our plans for exploration is consistent with what we laid out in our plan last often change there. We outlined our sight to these opportunities and activities and had planned for that. So that's all contained within that wedge of bucket or I call it bucket of capital that we allocate the major projects and exploration. So no change to that. And the big difference is, as we move our exploration dollars into 2020, a large much larger portions now moving into drilling in 2020. So looking forward to that.\nNitin Kumar\nAnd if you\u2019re going to sneak just one last one in. Nice tick down in well costs, particularly in the Permian, as you mentioned earlier. Was any of this coming from discounts from vendors or is this all operational?\nDave Stover\nIt's a combination as you would expect, if you look at the completion services in the Permian, there is a quite a lot of excess capacity still and so therefore, we're getting better pricing. And then remember last year, if you look across the full year, 2018 it was pretty, pretty busy out there and the cost had inflated. So we're definitely lower cost on the completion side, but it's also a function of us operating faster. So if we can increase stages per day and we can minimize the dead time and the waste in the completion activities. Then we get the dual benefit of lower cost and accelerated schedule, accelerated production coming online. So it's always a combination of both.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Vin Lovaglio with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vin your line is open. Is it muted on your end?\nAnd the next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJeanine Wai\nI just wanted to follow up on Tim\u2019s question real quick on the Permian. Can you talk about the differences in oil, well productivity between your northern and southern positions in the Delaware. I know you mentioned you had some attention wells, you let go some acreage in the Southwest portion. So just kind of wondering the difference between the two and whether when you look at the lateral lengths, whether they are longer in the north or longer in the South and where your inventory kind of lie to go sometimes I guess the acreage maths can be a little deceiving on that.\nDave Stover\nYes, on in terms of lateral lengths, we are going to drill on anytime we could drill two section links or 10,000 foot laterals. It's going to be our preference to drill them longer. If you look at the average well performance for the first quarter, including the four wells, on average we're happy with the outcome, but if you look at the difference between the northern and southern wells, we were well over 200 barrels, barrel equivalents per 1000 foot of lateral and as for a 10,000 foot lateral that'd be close to 2000 barrels a day. And so those are clearly the core of overcoming, the core of Reeves County is clearly the best that we have in our position and I think competes really well with the rest of industry there.\nJeanine Wai\nAnd then I guess along those lines, 95% of your activity is focused in this northern core acreage CGF this year and as you look over the next year or two, kind of, how does the geographic spread of where you think activity is going to be, how does that change. And is it more related to the CGF or is it something about maybe getting the well cost down or tweaking the completion design to have the southern acreage being a little more competitive with the north?\nDave Stover\nBut the southern acreage is already competitive with the north, it's the far southwest in the far maybe the South acreage that's different. So everything that we have remaining, we consider core and we'll always look to optimize Jeanine anytime, we can find a way to do either improve the completion design or change the frac design, change perforation designs, we are always looking for ways to do that. But we're happy with the bulk of the rest of the acreage position.\nKen Fisher\nAnd I think it's fair to add as Brent alluded to earlier that, a lot of the activities tied to taking advantage of the CGFS that we have in place because we get a real economies of scale as we continue to take advantage of that. So the activity will be focused around there.\nBrent Smolik\nMaybe we ask Hodge to just give you a few examples of how he is doing it. I'm really proud of the accomplishments of the team in just a quarter to be able to drive these efficiencies. So Hodge give them a few examples of how you are doing it.\nHodge Walker\nYes, thanks, Brent. Our teams are really been focused on driving out waste and identifying efficiencies, strong alignment between our service providers, our field team our office teams on continuously improving and we're not done.\nAs Brent mentioned earlier, we drilled a well in the Permian in 16 days. This is below our average, if we've done it once we can do it again. So areas that we're focusing. We talked about pumping hours that improved between 5% and 10% and we've seen examples on a given day where we've been pumping over 20 hours in a day. So these are examples of things that we've seen and examples on where we're going to keep striving for continuous improvement.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDavid Deckelbaum\nJust wanted to ask when you write off your original plans here divesting $500 million to a $1 billion were you specifically thinking about NBLX just opportunistically at that time. Or will you more thinking high level of just in absolute dollar amount that you wanted to arrive at and with NBLX achieve that for you. Are you still looking at another source of monetizations throughout the year?\nDave Stover\nI think what we reflected was we're always looking at the portfolio and it wasn't specific to NBLX but it was tied to the number of things we continue to look at whether it's some of the things on - in the onshore space that we can accelerate value on.\nSell down of midstream assets, we talked about Leviathan potentially monetizing a small portion of that when it comes online or sometime after. So it's just the whole mix of continuing to look at the portfolio and with that, what we saw is a reasonable expectation on what we should be thinking about this year? So nothing specific. And don't forget, we've already completed 15% to 20% of that target in the first quarter. So we've already progressed that.\nDavid Deckelbaum\nAnd then shipping in the DJ, as you progress through road to a new move I suppose further east, how does the GOR shifts as we get into 2Q and 3Q here. Should we be expecting a greater gas cut on moving into the sort of a higher GOR area or should we think of sort of your 1Q being the highest GOR in that row?\nDave Stover\nYes. So a couple of things in there. So at the well level and there is a chart on Page 6 in the materials we put out that might be useful reference for everyone, where we actually show the gas oil ratio trends across the greater part of the DJ there where our acreage is located.\nAt the well level what we'd expect, as we move east and north. If you think about where East Pony is up in the north, that we move east and north, we should see higher oil cuts or lower GORs at the well level.\nAnd then we're going to be averaging added to the total field production. So the trend should modestly trend up as we continue to develop this year. We guided originally, I think to 48% to 50% will be trending toward probably the lower end of that range through the rest of the year. The other thing noticed, I hate to talk about things out of period, but we did have two things that affected the oil percentage in the quarter.\nOne of them is that we had a fairly sizable gas PPA that came in that was positive. So that has the effect of lowering our oil percentage. The other is, we've done a good job of improving the recoveries of NGLs. So we had higher actual NGL recoveries, so when you look at those things together, they reported 46% oil would be a little by 47%. So I think it's, think of it as 47% trending up to 48 plus.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brad Whitmarsh for any closing remarks.\nBrad Whitmarsh\nYes, just want to thank everybody for joining us today. As I wrap up, I want to mention that Noble has recently issued its 8th Annual Sustainability Report covering a variety of social environmental and governance topics. That report is available on our website on the sustainability tab, and I hope you have a chance to look at the continued advancements that Noble is making in these areas. Should you have any follow-up questions for us today, please don't hesitate to reach out to Park, Kim or myself. Have a great day.\nOperator\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.\n\n",

We\u2019re very pleased to have Jeff Sloan, President of Global Payments. Jeff is going to go through a presentation, short presentation about 10-15 minutes and then we\u2019re going to open it up to Q&A. So Jeff, thank you very much.\nJeff Sloan\nThanks Will and thanks to Citi for having us here today. I\u2019m also with Jane Elliott and Kay Sharpton also from Global Payments. I\u2019m really going to cover three topics today in brief and then take questions. First is what is Global Payments today and how did we get where we are.\nSecond I will talk a bit about the market in a bit about then our strategy. But just to back up and get everyone on the same page. When we think about what our position and our strategy is for Global Payments it really has three elements to it. The first is we have a worldwide acquiring platform that enables processing of any transaction on any device at any time and that\u2019s a core part of what we do and we will talk more about this as we go through it.\nSecond, we have multiple avenues of distribution today. For our products we have direct distribution which I will also talk about and we also are a partner of choice for wholesaling our business and I will talk more about that too. And then lastly we think we are very well positioned and very attractive end markets.\nWe will talk a little bit about our most recent deal with HSBC and the attractiveness of India and Mainland China in particular. Just to start with a snapshot of global payments today. On the left hand side of this page, we have roughly a 70-30 split today of net revenue between North America which for us of course is U.S. and Canada. And we will be calling international for the rest of the world. Our business in Brazil today is a startup that\u2019s also included in North America.\nOn the right hand side of the page, just to give you a sense of size. We are one of the four largest processors, acquirers worldwide. We are physically present in over two dozen countries around the globe and we process roughly a third of a trillion dollars of volume per year again around the world.\nIn terms of our go to market strategy, globally there are really three elements to what we do and I touched them initially. The first is to expand the scope of our distribution. If you think about what we do we have a distribution end point largely to our merchants, banks or other partners. We have a technology platform that is then customized by geography. So our first strategy is to go to market through distinctive means of distribution that means two things first direct distribution. We have a roughly 1000 sales people today around the world who are W2 employees and who have quota and are directly producing today globally.\nSecond is our partner of choice model, where we are effectively a wholesaler and in that business we have bank partners, we have VAR partners and I will talk more about APT additionally in the presentation. We have ISO partners mainly here in the United States and we have got partners in areas like e-Commerce and Card-Not-Present like CyberSource and Visa.\nAnd interestingly that model is changing a bit which is something I will also talk about as it relates to our mobile strategy. The ability to provide solutions to companies like O2 which is a telecommunications company that we announced a few weeks ago. We had entered new partnership with Europe. The ability to actually distribute through mobile technology using what we call here a payment service provider or aggregation model. We\u2019re providing wholesaling services to someone like O2 and then they are reselling those services through mobile technology into their consumer and customer base in United Kingdom. I think it's a new line of business for us and that\u2019s why it's broken out separately here in terms of distribution.\nWhat this means is if you walk into a O2 store in the United Kingdom and you\u2019re a carpenter or a plumber or a painter and alike and get a phone from O2 that will come with an EMV compliant dongle that you can then use to process transactions and we\u2019re wholesaling that infrastructure to O2 today. We announced a similar deal with Yell which is now called Hibu and there is more on that to come but that\u2019s another distinctive element of distribution and I think that you will see more of from us going forward.\nOur second initiative is to grow our geographic footprint. We have expanded our business in the last couple of years in Europe through a partnership for example with La Caixa in Spain.\nWe have expanded our business in Asia-Pacific, most recently through our agreements to repurchase a 44% minority interest from HSBC and expand our business beyond HSBC there is a very good partner of ours into other regions in Asia-Pacific including in particular India and Mainland China and lastly I touched on our expansion into Latin and South-America especially in Brazil.\nAnd lastly we needed to deliver enhanced value to our customers you may have seen our announcement with PayPal and Discover to allow PayPal transactions to be through our partnership with Discover that is part of the type of value I think we bring to our merchant base and enabling acceptance of any transaction at any time on any device. We also need to capitalize additionally on incremental multi-national transactions. So if you go to what I talked about before with O2 that is just the first part and I expect to be a multi-national relationship with people just like that so our ability to service those transactions out of our service center in Manila and in the Philippines and to provide that kind of functionality in whatever market a large corporate partner wants to go into at any time and seamlessly I think is very distinctive to us.\nJust a quick scorecard in terms of how we have done as a public company from our spin from National Data Corp in 2001. You all can read these numbers but we are generally up 7 to 8 times over that period depending on the metric that you\u2019re looking at this page and that includes environments like the tech crash in 2001 obviously 9/11 and the recession of 2008 so we feel very good about our performance as a public company.\nIn terms of the breadth of our distribution I talked before about being a worldwide business. In general what we are one, two or three by way of market share in each international market that we are in and you can see the detail on this slide. This also I think supports the concept that we are the partner of choice for complicated financial institutions and complicated corporate customers wherever they are in the world and here is the geographic evidence of that.\nAs I mentioned before we are proud of our results as a public company. This is a last few years coupled with the size of the company at the time of spin in fiscal 2001 in terms of performance and you can see a 17% comp and annual growth rate and net revenues over that period and a 27% comp and annual growth rate in cash earnings per share.\nSo let\u2019s talk for a minute about market trends. I think most of the people in this room probably don\u2019t need to tell them if this is an attractive market and you can see the five trends listed on this page. I just wanted to highlight a few of the multiple levers that we look at for growth. In general our benchmark in any given market is Visa and MasterCard transaction growth. We should be growing and Visa and MasterCard transaction unit growth or better and generally better in every market that we\u2019re not in.\nIt's important to drill down and figure out exactly in a given market what industries that we participated and where we chose to play but in general that is our target. Number two, as I mentioned before I think we\u2019re a very good partner of choice in many of our markets. That means with very few exceptions we should find someone to partner with. We have been going to a new, into a new region. Brazil is actually an exception because of the way the market has developed in Brazil. Overtime but our partnership with La Caixa in Spain is a very good example of finding the right partnership when we go into new markets. Next new payment types and technologies, at the end of the day our value proposition to our customers is to enable them to accept ubiquity of payments, any device any time any location that means PayPal in our most recent announcement that means any kind of device from a wallet point of view as it relates to NFC where merchants value and our relationship is the ability to help them facilitate commerce. It shouldn\u2019t matter to us how it's coming in or what scheme is providing it, instead it matters that we can facilitate that transaction and in general complexity is a good thing for our business and more complicated something is, the more value added we can provide and the more we can generally charge for given transaction types.\nAnd the last point in terms of integrated solutions I think is also a very important. We will come to APT and the acquisition in a minute but in general our thesis is that the world is getting more complicated rather than less, our ability to integrate into multiple providers of software that provide enterprise resource packages into dental offices, into veterinary offices, into retailers, restaurants, automotive repair shops. Our ability to integrate into that functionality and ultimately make to ensure that its EMV compliant is a core go to market strategy and what we are trying to do and it's very difficult to disintermediate or too commoditized.\nI think everybody in the room is probably seen this up into the right chart that\u2019s listed on this page. I think that two things to note are the relative size of the U.S. bar and how big that bar remains even by way of forecast in 2015. So all the rate of growth in the U.S. business is obviously slower than that of the international business. There is still a very big chunk of the world\u2019s economy as forecasted here in 2015.\nThe other thing I want to mention is the size of the Asia-Pacific bar listed here in 2015, a key thesis of ours in buying out the joint venture and the 44% interest that are partner HSBC had and in a joint venture is that Asia is going to become a bigger part of the world\u2019s economy and of the transaction volume globally over what\u2019s now the next three to five years on this slide and I will talk more about that when I talk about the transaction.\nSo there is a number of changes in our market that I think are really going to drive our growth at a macro level and we are going to the detail in a minute. The first is the adoption of the United States market of EMV whether it's chip and signature or chip and pin.\nAnd as many of you in the room know that it's coming at least in the first stage by April 1 of 2013 for the networks of the United States. EMV is very good news for our business and the reason it's good news for our business is that we have experienced around the world in EMV adoption so we just put in place EMV in Canada over the last two years is a core skillset of ours to make our customer base EMV compliant and I think provides as well on the integrated software side a barrier to entry to make the integrated software products that we have EMV capable.\nSo while the first touch point for EMV is in April and the ultimate liability shift is not until October. We are very well positioned and we expect to capture share out of the EMV implementation. The next slide I think we are benefiting from is network evolution. So as I mentioned before about aggregation and payment service providers on the networks in the last 12 months Visa MasterCard in particular have substantially loosened their requirements around aggregation and payment service providers. Today we have a very large aggregation business in Europe and here in the United States we have our own subsidiaries called Greater Giving which is a not for profit VAR subsidiary of ours that we have owned for a number of years. But our ability to enable new customers to adopt mobile technology think about my O2 example at the beginning of the presentation is going to be likely done on an aggregator basis.\nBut we\u2019re not going to underwrite O2s end customer we are really underwriting O2 and the ability to do that to the chain is in the network rules. Given our familiarity with that business model here in the United States as well as in Europe is a core asset of ours.\nWhen I first raised the aggregation model for example with one of our colleagues in Canada the first question he asked me was what\u2019s an aggregator? So if our own people don\u2019t know in Canada what an aggregator is I know we\u2019re are early on in the market and I think that\u2019s the highlights the ability of our worldwide business to actually spur adoption.\nThe third is social culture trends; you\u2019re (inaudible) mobile to figure out where the world is going there. We\u2019re in the market today not just with O2 in Europe but with service providers here in the United States who are paring that mobile technology.\nAt the end of the day it doesn\u2019t really matter to us what that mobile technology looks like. What matters is that we capture the processing, captures much of the economics as we can. So I view our business very similar to that of an arms manufacturer as long as someone is producing we\u2019re going to do fine especially in businesses with incipient growth.\nNext element is digital commerce that also includes social media and the internet. We announced our transaction with CyberSource which closed on February 1st of this year of 2012. We are very pleased with that transaction is gone. We bought our portfolio I believe roughly 9000 Card-Not-Present pricing customers here in the United States and also came with a referral relationship with Visa for additional Card-Not-Present volume. That relationship is done very well and exceeded our expectations since February. Let me close the transaction and I think Visa is a partner who drive our e-commerce business is generally a very good thing.\nNot just in the United States but also around the world and then lastly from the multi-national point of view. Not only do I believe that we have a very expansive multinational footprint as I mentioned before, we have a presence in 26 countries and the ability to authorize and settle in 50 currencies today but our service center in Manila actually handles much of our volume around the world. We handle 95% of our voice authorizations today out of Manila for the United States. So it's a relatively seamless infrastructure 24/7, it's very helpful for us to have 500 employees in Asia in the Philippines providing service but it also means when new customers come to us and ask us to switch on mobile in any jurisdiction that they are in we can do all that out of Manila from a service center with a very competitive cost differentiation advantage and it also to mean I\u2019m very quickly and seamlessly in the same systems that we use here in the United States.\nLet\u2019s talk a little bit more about strategy. So there are really five elements that we are managing toward in our business and I will talk about each one of these in more detail but these all support the three points that I laid out upfront. Worldwide acquiring footprint, second multiple avenues of distribution both direct as well as partnering of choice and third we are present physically and attractive end markets.\nSo first let\u2019s talk about our Americas business. There are really two elements to what we are doing in the United States in Canada; the first is to continue our direct distribution channel. So one of the core strategies I have when I came in Global Payments was to build out direct distribution in the United States. I will talk more about APT in a moment but APT really puts us on the right footing to build out direct distribution. While nothing is impossible you will be very surprised if we did another transaction with an ISO or another service provider here in the United States for distribution reasons. I think APT really got us to where we need to be and I will spend a minute on that in a few moments. The second thing we need to do is expand our partner of choice model where a very good wholesaler in what we do. Part of that as our existing ISO business and part of that its listed here is our e-commerce business with CyberSource and Visa.\nI also mentioned before our ability to roll out additional aggregation models and payment service provider models in multiple geographies. We do that already in the United States through our wholesaling and we will be doing more of that with corporates that will come down the pipe.\nThe second thing that we need to do is introduce additional product and service offerings. One of the things that\u2019s nice about being a multinational corporation is to take things that work. In one geography outside of the United States and bring them somewhere else. So for example we have announced that we are rolling out dynamic currency conversion into the United States. We have already rolled it out in Canada and that roll out as we described in our September call is exceeding our expectations and the reason we were able to do that is that we rolled it out first in Asia a number of years ago and we were very happy with how the roll out did in Asia. So here we took a product that we have in Asia. We brought it to Canada and now we are bringing it to the United States.\nBy the way we also brought that into Spain and it's a meaningful piece of our La Caixa joint ventures growth and profit this year.\nSecond thing we need to focus on is emerging payments, I have already talked about PayPal but to enable any type of purchase at the point of sale regardless of the source is a key value proposition of ours and then lastly I already talked about geographic expansion and what we are doing in Brazil. We hope to add to that to other parts of Latin America. We were in Mexico and other parts of Latin America when we owned a money transfer business which we sold a few years ago. We need to get back to that market that really is a last market of size by way of scope that we are not physically present in today. I\u2019m talking about Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Argentina principally. Brazil I think you already know about.\nSo let me spend a minute talking about APT and our Americas business and why we announced and closed that transaction in October this year. That transaction came with about 700 VAR partners the biggest verticals that they were focused on were dental, veterinary, healthcare, pharmacy, auto repair, retail, restaurant, saloon, dry cleaner that kind of thing. The purchase price was just about $400 million and as I mentioned closed a few weeks ago. There were really a handful reasons why we thought this was the right transaction to do.\nThe first was to control more of our end points of distribution. As we announced in the press release most of the 8 million of dollar volume that came with APT was on a blended basis that means it was not cost plus but instead it was quoted on a spread basis. It's important for us to own more of the value chain of this services that we are providing to our merchant customers. So in our wholesaling model we are generally cost plus and number of pennies per transaction but as volumes go up and as tickets go up we benefit by more transaction volume but not by dollar volume. The inverse is the case with APT, in the case of APT and also in the case of CyberSource by the way we benefit from increases in volume and increases in spread and increases in ticket.\nSo the ability to better control pricing and have more firm control over distribution end points is a core part of what we want to do, if you like what we do now will like more of it better. The second thing is strong retention profile; integrated solutions have very low attrition. So APT had what I consider to be very low attrition and very high retention for fast growing payments, businesses that we have experienced with.\nThe third piece I already touched on expand vertical markets that came with over 30 vertical markets that are active today, the most significant of which is only 25% penetrated. So plenty of avenues for growth at APT and for integrated solutions and lastly strong financial performance and trajectory. This is a business that was growing well north of our organic rate of revenue growth, had a much better margin than ours did and therefore much better EBITDA and cash EBIT growth than we were experiencing on our own.\nAnd now is all on the context of the U.S. business. I will be very disappointed if a few years from now we didn\u2019t look back and expand this business meaningfully not just at the United States and beat those numbers but actually expand it around the world including in particular in Canada, Europe and Asia with a VAR business is just incipient and remember we\u2019re already in those markets today with a 1000 sales people. If we can\u2019t take those guys and partner with this technology then we\u2019re really missing something.\nAccelerate growth internationally; this is very similar to the U.S. business. I mentioned before in the third ball point in the left payment service providers with O2 and Yell now called Hibu, there are more coming there. I talked just a minute ago about the VAR channel, and new partnerships. I do want to talk about additional products in those regions. I mentioned Spain who has now brought DCC from Asia into the Spanish market, we\u2019re doing very well with it and we\u2019re doing the same thing with IPP or installment payment plans.\nSo paying by installments is common in Asia, it's common in Spain, we took the same technology that we had in Asia and brought it over to Spain and we are selling that today in the Spanish market. That is not something that La Caixa would have done but for our partnership.\nAnd then lastly on geographic expansion, we need to find additional geographies to expand our business in. We\u2019re generally not in contact to Europe directly and by that I mean Germany, France and Italy we are there at Card-Not-Present basis. So we do look proactively for expansion opportunities in those markets. We also through our partnerships with people like La Caixa have the ability to acquire more growth in market. La Caixa is purchasing a number of fail banks in Spain with government assistance, they are the good bank and these failed banks are debt banks (ph).\nThose merchant portfolios then become referred to us as a right of first refusal and we have the ability to expand our market channel in Spain through our existing partnership which is also a good thing.\nLet me talk a minute about HSBC and the agreement that we announced in July to buying the 44% of the joint venture that we didn\u2019t currently own. As we said publically this is going to close in the second our fiscal second quarter of 2013. HSBC has been a terrific partner of ours around the world including in Asia. This will extend our partnership with HSBC into the early 2020s form a referral point of view but importantly with a removal of the 44% interest we can now approach markets like India and Mainland China that by the way of contract and also from a regulatory and business point of view we could not expand in because we were affiliated with a third party HSBC.\nSo HSBC has about 45 branches in India that is the cap in India for growth of a non-Indian financial institution. We have a great partnership with them in India but we did not have the ability for example to go beyond those 45 branches with anybody else either contractually or is it business matter. This will remove that restriction. Importantly those referrals from HSBC will remain exclusive to us through 2021 I believe.\nFrom a technology point of view I mentioned before that we want to approach the market multi-nationally with uniform front ends and back ends so unlike many of the businesses that you may see that are global we are really on a common backend around the world. So we have a settlement system by large in all the markets that we are in. We\u2019re down to two or three front ends depending on the market that you\u2019re in, and the timing which actually is a low number given where we have come through in the industry. Ultimately the value proposition to the customer is integrate with us once anywhere and your other markets around the world between this and our Philippine center that you would like to be in.\nI think that\u2019s particularly important in the context of what we are trying to accomplish in the mobile landscape. Lastly in terms of acquisitions going forward, acquisitions have been a big part of our growth historically. We have spent a lot of time and I do as well on our pipeline. You can see what our criteria are broken down by geography. I think it's in the U.S., I don\u2019t see us doing additional ISO transactions beyond APT. We are opportunistic but that\u2019s all about vertical markets for us and newer technologies in the rest of the world listed here those are all market expansion opportunities.\nSo it's finding the right partner in the right geographic region or it's getting bigger with our partnership with La Caixa where we already have a meaningful presence.\nLastly from a product point of view, our perspective to approaching our partnerships is very similar to providing a base lever of functionality which you can see in the middle here and allowing other people to plug and play into us.\nSo before we bought APT we released a number of developer portals where people can code into our systems and we will certify them in our gateway. APT was doing the same thing from a VAR point of view. This is very similar of course to what Apple is doing with iTunes and what Google does and alike. Our job is to provide innovation for what we are doing but also to provide a common set of footprints what are our customers are using us to do around the world. Innovation is something that they need to do as well. We are not going to have every good idea and they should be able to plug and play into us. So this was a core part of our thesis before we bought APT and I would say a logical extension of our product strategy.\nAnd then lastly I think we have already touched on this but we really are very performance focused and focused on growth. You can read this for yourselves but I think our performance since the spin 11.5 years ago at this point highlights many of the things in this page and I do think we have a very distinctive go to market approach both with our own direct distribution as well as with our partnerships around the world. That\u2019s it.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session \nUnidentified Analyst\nWe have a few minutes for questions I\u2019m just going to kick it off one and open it up for the audience and then I have follow-ups. So first and you addressed this a bit with the O2 announcement and with the announcement with PayPal but just wanted to get your view on new entrance non-traditional entrance into the industry Square comes to mind, PayPal and understanding that merchant acquiring has always been an incredibly competitive industry. Are you seeing incremental competition particular at small and small, medium size from these players? Is it a blip on the radar screen?\nJeff Sloan\nNo I don\u2019t think it's a blip, I think that the businesses you said well has always been extremely competitive and I don\u2019t expect I have to change, I only expect it to be more competitive. What I would say though is when I look at new pay types like PayPal and when I look at new entrance like Square that is really an opportunity for us. So as I mentioned in the presentation one thing they were very good at is wholesaling our infrastructure. We have a long established history here in the United States and now around the world to things like O2, Yell and others have actually renting our facilities and growing with our partners and we have been very fortunate to be able to do that.\nSo when I look at Square or Group on and alike those are very sophisticated customers but they are ISOs versus looking to provide complete functionality from an acquiring point of view. So ISO is a business that we are good at. We also have the competitive advantage of been able to provide that around the world in any market that they may choose, any device, anytime, anywhere and I think that\u2019s an area we do very well especially out of our center in the Philippines. So I look at that and think about our ability to help them grow in the United States and outside of it.\nAnd I also think about our ability to add more corporate ISOs to what we do like O2 and allow them to wholesale our infrastructure as well.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay great. One more question from me, the Canada business has been a bit of a challenge for Global Payments for the last couple of quarters as a result of some pricing actions or some slight compression. If you can just give us maybe a little bit of background on what\u2019s going on there and then any sort of outlook that you can give us in terms of where that\u2019s going?\nJeff Sloan\nSure so I think we are in a happy place today with where the Canada business is trending. Our job as we talked in our July call and September is to make sure it's not a head wind or if it's a head wind a modest head wind this fiscal year for our Americas business and that\u2019s what we are executing on. We hit our income contribution numbers for the first quarter and just to map the rest of the year is progressive improvement. As it plays out the way David described in the call.\nCanada is principally an issue related to spread diminution around the small to mid-size segment. If you look at our transaction growth well we have actually had very good meaning better than Visa, MasterCard interact by unit growth which again looking back at what I said is how we measure progress in our business. So I believe that we have been capturing share in Canada. The problem is it's been coming at more reduced spreads. So we have a legacy book at a higher rate of spread than we were selling new accounts. Those will not converge overtime but these (inaudible) book will migrate and our job is to manage transaction growth relative to spread diminution and by introducing new products like DCC which I talked about by reducing attrition and we have seen attrition come down in Canada through analytics that we put in place in that market and we have very attractive attrition low attrition, high retention through additional sales efforts.\nWe are actually performing as I mentioned quite nicely and then through selected price actions and cost reductions to manage it so it doesn\u2019t appeal the rest of the growth of the Americas and I think you will see improvement as guidance applies throughout the rest of fiscal \u201913.\nThe other thing I would say I do feel like recent announcements from one of the networks about pricing actions in Canada in the spring of 2013 will help our business. We have been kind of out there in island with visible movements over the last number of years without any actions by others, more generally it's part of a macroeconomic environment with what\u2019s going on in economy in Canada.\nSo this is only going to help us, it's not reflected in our guidance, it's upside to what we are doing. So when I look at where we need to be in that business and where we are today, I actually feel pretty good about the trend.\nUnidentified Analyst\nIt's great, maybe I can open it up to see if there are any questions.\nUnidentified Analyst\nCan you just spend a little a little bit of time talking about that selling process in China, and India? Is that a missionary sale, do you have to convince them of the business model of a referral relationship or are they already in payments to some extent and this is you know not a 6 to 12 month education process which have to go through?\nJeff Sloan\nIt does of course vary by market; I would say that in India there already is a more robust referral environment in that market from financial institutions. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a long a tail as you might otherwise think in India. So from a pure referral point of view we are making progress in that market and I expect to make more. I would say in any market doing a more formal joint venture is a fairly lengthy undertaking because that really is a development like transaction that can be complicated once you get into various cost elements but I would say in India I felt pretty good. Our ability to generate additional referrals.\nI think in the case of Mainland China we have a great partner really in CUP and in HSBC in China I think though that in China just given where that economy is and the stage development of cards in China that\u2019s probably going to take a little more time and be a little bit more missionary work in those markets. Many of those markets are lesser developed in terms of the state of evolution. Obviously CPU denominated transactions in China are big part of the market.\nNow the happy news there is that we are the only non-Chinese company who can acquire CUP denominated transactions in China, in Mainland China.\nSo I feel like we\u2019re well positioned there but in China approvals to enter new regions are largely by region so the kind of region by region and unless we find a bank partner in that region then we have to see that market with new sales people. We don\u2019t have an existing book and that can be a longer undertaking. So I think both are very good opportunities for us. I think the opportunities in India are marginally in near term for the reason I mentioned. But these are things that we are both focused on but I can\u2019t control is when the banks decided to do something. So it's important to have multiple irons in the fire and so whatever hits, hits when it does and that\u2019s the part that\u2019s hard for me to control but I think we are making progress is both markets and that\u2019s how we think about.\nUnidentified Analyst\nIn your comments about the O2 transaction you made a point of saying you underwrote O2 but not their customers. I was just interested if you would elaborate on that and second question is you work with skew data on the transactions that you process, how do you use skew data for the benefit of your merchant customers?\nJeff Sloan\nSo on the first part of what you said we always do underwrite just to be clear in the context of AML and KYC, so from a regulatory point of view we are always reviewing what our partners do to make sure that we are all doing the right thing on AML and KYC especially in the context of mobile which is really kind of instant decisioning. So it's important to get that right and I do think that\u2019s a good functionality and an important functionality that we provide. What I meant there is ultimately from a credit risk point of view which is my comment about underwriting. From a credit risk point of view it's a different quantitative and qualitative assessment about the viability of someone like O2 for a large corporate for that matter then it is about Jane or Kay (ph) as a separate consumer coming into an O2 store who wants to take out a phone and a dongle as part of their service as been a carpenter or painter in that kind of thing.\nSo we\u2019re monitoring that to make sure that we are doing whatever makes sense from a AML and KYC point of view but the credit has enhanced obviously very considerably by relying on the balance sheet and the market cap of O2. That\u2019s no different than what we do to lot of our tech customers today around the world which is just a corporate matter rather than necessarily a discreet underwriting an individual\u2019s credit if it's been provided at the corporate level.\nEssentially what I meant rather than to parse underwriting rather than to comment all about the regulatory which we have to do in any case. On your second comment I don\u2019t think we provided a lot of skew level detail today to be candidate. We are really not \u2013 people talk about big data and the information services element of what we do I think you can see a lot of that in royalty and couponing and alike but as a general matter I don\u2019t think we really mind or keep or feedback a lot of that data to our customers today. That maybe a state that we evolve too ultimately, I don\u2019t think we particularly a reason industry (ph) do a particularly good job of that and that\u2019s why I think some of the larger retailers who do that have a competitive advantage perhaps. But I don\u2019t see us doing a lot of that today and I think in an immediate term probably won't be doing a lot of that at the skew level.\nUnidentified Analyst\nWe\u2019re out of time, actually we are over time. So I want to thank Jeff. I appreciate it.\nJeff Sloan\nThanks Will.\n\n",

Bernstein & Co.\nOperator\nGood morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call.\nP&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.\nAlso, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business, and has posted on its website, www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.\nNow I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.\nJon Moeller\nThanks and good morning.\nAs David Taylor said on the press release we issued earlier this morning, we continue to make progress on the transformation we are making to return P&G's results to a balance of strong top line growth, bottom line growth, and cash generation. We achieved a significant milestone this quarter in the transformation of the product portfolio with the exit of batteries business. We delivered another strong quarter of productivity improvement and cost savings. And we increased investments in innovation, advertising, and selling capacity to enhance our long-term prospects for faster, sustainable top line growth and value creation.\nWe do continue to operate in a challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both a volume and value basis have decelerated, due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 3%.\nThere are more flashpoints across the globe than at any time in recent memory, with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets: Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil. We generate more than 10% of our annual sales and profit in these markets.\nCurrencies have weakened across the board since the start of our fiscal year. While the dollar has softened a bit recently, we still face up to $1 billion after-tax net earnings impact versus year ago, a $200 million increase since just the start of December. Across four years, FX has reduced net earnings by about $4 billion after tax, nearly 40% of fiscal year 2012 net earnings.\nAgainst this backdrop, we remain focused on large opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, step-changing cost and cash productivity, transforming our portfolio, strengthening our organization and culture, and reaccelerating top line growth with strength in category business models and innovation plans and, where appropriate, improved value equations. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. I'm going to talk briefly about each of those transformation steps, productivity, portfolio, organization, and top line reacceleration, before getting in to the details of the quarter.\nWe continue to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity, with significant upside still ahead. Our original five-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, $1 billion or more above our initial target. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last three years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down 20%. We're targeting a 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017.\nIn February 2012, we announced that we would reduce non-manufacturing overhead by 10% over five years. As of March 31, we've reduced these roles by more than 24%, almost 2.5 times the original target. We expect to meet our latest target of 25% to 30% by the end of this year, one year ahead of schedule. Including divestitures, we'll reduce non-manufacturing roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal 2017.\nWe're reducing non-working marketing expenditures, costs that do not impact reach, frequency, or continuity of our advertising and trial generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. Last year we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year, reinvesting those savings in advertising and sampling of consumer-preferred products.\nNet of reinvestments in innovations, selling, media, and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant currency gross and operating profit margin improvement in each of the last three fiscal years, driving double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of those years. We're on track to improve gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency impacts, again this fiscal year. We're driving productivity up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down. Payable days are up. Balance sheet productivity has enabled us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2, and 105% in the quarter we just completed, even as we spend capital to transform our supply chain.\nWe continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega-cap companies. We're among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. Over the past decade we have returned more than $118 billion in cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase.\nWe said four years ago that we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture, as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity both inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next five years. Our supply chain transformation is in its early stages, first in North America and Europe, then in Latin America and in India, Middle East, and Africa.\nWe're in an investment mode now, with savings to start in three to four years. Our new U.S. mixing centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller single-category sites in less cost-effective locations. We're upgrading and standardizing manufacturing platforms to lower cost and facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, raw material and finished product logistics, and demand planning. We have additional opportunity to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend.\nAfter two strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending $1.5 billion in agency-related marketing costs, still more room to improve. We'll continue to look for efficiencies in working media with better advertising targeting and earned media campaigns with engaging content.\nAs we fully operationalize the new focused 10-category company, there will undoubtedly be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility, and speed of decision-making. Digitization will continue to enable smart productivity choices.\nFinally, we'll be working to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our promotion spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in deductions between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of this spend for both us and our retail partners and to improve its efficiency.\nSo we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next five years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, sales capacity, and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth and to create value for shareowners.\nIn addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. Over the past 18 months, we've divested, discontinued, or consolidated 55 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. We have 50 more brands in the exit process, including the 41 Beauty brands in the transaction with Coty. The S-4 registration statement for the Beauty transaction was filed last week. We're on track to close the deal in the second half of the calendar year.\nIn total we'll exit 105 brands and all the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of fiscal 2013 profit. Going forward, we're anchoring our portfolio on 10 category-based business units and about 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company.\nWithin these core businesses, we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short, mid, and long-term value creation, forgoing bad businesses even when these choices create near-term top line pressure.\nIn Mexico, for example, we made the choice to discontinue low-tier, unprofitable, and commoditizing toilet paper products in favor of very profitable high-tier differentiated products. Sales are down 75%, but before-tax margins have improved by more than 50 basis points, from very negative to nicely positive. It will take a few more quarters for the top line drag to dissipate, and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward.\nIn India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates, but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. The strategic portion of our India business is growing at a high single-digit pace. Sales in the portion we're fixing or exiting have been down more than 30%. This top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up about 700 basis points. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just two years.\nWe're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio, discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches and tablets, and value-tier detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag of nearly a point on the global Fabric Care business, but profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business improves. Combined, these choices are causing about a one-point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of the calendar year and then dissipate as we annualize more of the impacts. As we come out of this, we'll have stronger top line growth that is worth something on the bottom line.\nWe're transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious, but together are significant and important. As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We eliminated overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing and sales professionals in the global business units and market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability. Reflecting this, we changed the name of the market development organizations to Selling and Market Operations, small but very important.\nWe're increasingly staffing leadership roles in the selling and marketing operations with leaders who have significant selling experience. We're changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple, improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to winning.\nConsistent with this, we're dedicating sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets, sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is a change. We're aligning incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and to increase accountability.\nAnother example of the evolution of our thinking on the organization is what David talked about at CAGNY. He said that P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent and that we intend to maintain our develop-from-within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be inside our organization. Going forward, we're going to look at outside hiring more often when we need it to field the best team possible. The bottom line is that we're committed to getting, keeping, and growing the right talent in the right place to better drive business results. Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious, but collectively they are big and important changes for our organization and culture.\nA very important area of transformation is the reacceleration of top line growth. We expect to make progress in all 10 product categories, but we're putting specific emphasis against the four largest categories, Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care, and Grooming; and the two largest markets, the U.S. and China. These four categories represent over 60% of sales and profit. These two countries represent nearly 50% of sales and more than 50% of profit.\nWe're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium priced unit-dosed detergents and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're exiting slower growing, lower-priced, more commoditized product forms where it's more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrates what's possible when we deliver superior value with best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind these efforts, with the category up more than four points on a value basis over the last three, six, and nine-month periods.\nThe same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancers category is growing, up more than six points on a value basis over the last three, six, and nine-month periods.\nOur share is growing. P&G's U.S. laundry detergent and fabric enhancer value shares were each up nearly a point in the March quarter. We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. Seventy percent of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The Odor Defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide Pods, brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect Odor Defense beats, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym.\nNext month we start our learning market on Tide Pure Clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category. Unlocking growth in naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure Clean provides the cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients, and it's produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operating with zero manufacturing waste to landfill.\nWe're launching better performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil, and China. In Russia and Turkey, where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G's share of liquid detergents are up seven points and 14 points respectively. We've increased sampling in new washing machines, a key point of category entry and change for consumers. Last fiscal year, we distributed 5 million samples in washing machines globally. This fiscal year, we'll distribute about 17 million. In calendar year 2016, we'll distribute 30 million samples of our best performing products.\nIn U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs, and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up a point in the March quarter. Pampers' latest Swaddlers and Cruisers innovation, Extra Absorb Channels, was off to a good start in the new calendar year, with Swaddlers and Cruisers share up more than a point in the last quarter.\nWe strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at the point of market entry. Seventy percent of new moms in the U.S. will receive samples of our best products through our prenatal baby shower and hospital programs.\nLast fiscal year marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth for the Luvs brand in the U.S. However, results have been down so far this year following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. We're taking steps to improve the awareness, trial, and consumer value of Luvs. We increasing equity-building advertising, strengthening in-store programs, and have product and packaging improvements slated for launch next quarter.\nBaby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we've strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving our point of market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms.\nIn Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. last quarter. Pantene's new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers Weightless Conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial barrier in the category. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competition in North America, China, and Japan.\nWe continue to strongly support Head & Shoulders, one of our steadiest and strongest growing brands, delivering over 8% compound average sales growth over the past 10 years, even with significant currency impacts. Organic sales for Pantene and Head & Shoulders were each up high single digits in the U.S. in the March quarter.\nGillette has delivered steady growth in international markets so far this fiscal year behind strong innovation, advertising, and sampling programs. Gillette is holding or growing value share in each region outside the U.S. The growth in international markets has been offset by soft results in the U.S.\nTo improve our growth and the growth of the market, we're investing in innovation, new user trial, and improved consumer value. We're expanding our performance advantage at the top end of the market. Our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched last quarter. ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades shields against irritation during every shave. Early consumption results in the U.S. have been tracking ahead of plan.\nWe're supporting a broader range of our product ladder, from our best product, Fusion FlexBall ProShield to MACH3 to premium priced and superior performance disposables, with stronger consumer value communication. We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points, and we will respond to ensure our brands remain a superior consumer value.\nWe've stepped up new trial activities in the U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We have put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men, over 2 million samples last year, a 33% increase over the prior year level. We've now begun sampling the FlexBall razor handle and the ProShield cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies.\nWe're not standing still in the other categories. We've delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. this quarter in the Feminine Care, Family Care, and Home Care categories, all big and profitable businesses for us. P&G continues to be the innovation leader in our U.S. categories. In the IRI Innovation Pacesetters report just published, P&G had four of the top 10 innovations and six of the top 13. Top innovations recognized for 2015 sales were Tide Simply Clean & Fresh, Always Discreet, Fusion ProGlide FlexBall, Venus Swirl, Febreze Unstoppables, and Tide Plus Ultra Stain Release. Overall in the U.S., organic sales were up 2%, in line with underlying market growth of our categories. Organic volume was up 3% for the quarter.\nWe're making progress in China, but there's still more work to do. We narrowed sales declines by half this quarter and expect to improve again next quarter. We recently upgraded our Pampers premium diaper pants to improve fit and softness, and we have new innovations coming soon on mid-tier pants and premium taped diapers. Oral-B Super Premium toothpaste launched in over 700 stores last quarter, reaching roughly a 5% share in those outlets. We'll triple distribution on this item this quarter. Ariel is growing in China following the concentrated liquid detergent launch in January. Gillette Fusion FlexBall has driven male razor system share growth over the past three, six, and 12-month periods. And SK-II continues to deliver very strong growth, with sales for the quarter up nearly 20%.\nSo some bright spots are emerging, but it will take time to get fully back to target growth rates. We are realistic that improvements in top line growth won't happen overnight and they won't happen in a straight line, but they will continue to improve over time.\nLet me move now to the quarter we just completed and to the outlook for the fiscal year. Organic sales were up 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. The impact from the portfolio cleanup efforts I discussed earlier was about a one-point drag on organic sales growth. All-in sales were down 7%, including a five-point headwind from foreign exchange, three points from the combination of Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures.\nCore earnings per share were $0.86, down 3% versus the prior year. Core gross margin increased 270 basis points. Core operating margin increased 300 basis points. This quarter's core earnings per share results included a net FX headwind of approximately $90 million after tax or $0.03 per share, comprised of a negative spot rate impact of about $230 million, which was partially offset by a $140 million balance sheet revaluation impact in the base period that did not recur this year.\nVenezuela continues to be a difficult market and was also a drag on March quarter results. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we announced our decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan operations, no longer reporting sales or profits from products locally manufactured and sold in Venezuela. We continue to recognize sales and profit on products sold to our Venezuelan subsidiaries from non-Venezuelan P&G entities. We highlighted at CAGNY that a disruption in our Venezuelan subsidiary's ability to access dollars to pay for these imports of finished products could have a negative impact on our top and bottom line results.\nWe've been unable to access U.S. dollars in any size since November, and as a result reported no sales or profit for Venezuela in the March quarter. This caused a 20 basis point organic sales growth reduction in the quarter. On the bottom line, the total impact of Venezuela was $0.05 per share or 6% in terms of core EPS. Assuming these financing constraints continue, the bottom line impact on the year will be up to $0.10 per share or minus 3%.\nThe core effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.2%, up 800 basis points versus last year, a $0.10 per share impact on core earnings per share and 11 percentage point impact on core earnings per share growth. The base period tax rate was unusually low due to the geographic mix of earnings and due to audit settlements, and the current period rate was inflated by a valuation allowance against net operating loss carry-forwards. These two items account for about six points of the eight-point change in the tax rate.\nThese three impacts, FX, Venezuela, and tax, were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of 20% this quarter.\nOn an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.97 for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior year. We generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, yielding 105% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned approximately $2.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. In addition, we received approximately $4.2 billion of stock through the Duracell transaction.\nEarlier this month, we increased the dividend 1%, making this the 60th consecutive year the company has increased the dividend. The size of the dividend increase reflects FX headwinds, the cash impacts from streamlining and strengthening the business unit portfolio, and our plans to increase investments in the business to accelerate top line growth.\nMoving to guidance, our outlook for the fiscal year reflects four large factors driving lower earnings in the fourth quarter. First, lower non-operating income; we expect about $100 million less in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. Second, tax; the Q4 tax rate will likely be again about 800 basis points higher than last year due to the geographic earnings mix and audit settlement benefits in the base period. Third, investment levels; we'll have a significant increase in advertising expense coupled with continued reinvestment in R&D and selling capabilities. Fourth, FX; we'll continue to see significant spot rate impacts on both the top and bottom line in Q4 and, unlike the last two quarters, will not have offsets from base period balance sheet revaluation changes. Combined, we expect these four factors to lower Q4 net earnings by more than $800 million and reduce core earnings per share by more than 32% versus the prior year.\nFor the fiscal year, we're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. As I mentioned, our outlook assumes we'll no longer benefit from sales of finished product to our deconsolidated subsidiaries in Venezuela. This will be roughly a 30 basis point drag on Q4 organic sales growth.\nIn addition, the roughly one-point drag from the core portfolio cleanup will continue into Q4. We expect FX will have a six to seven percentage point impact on all-in sales growth for the fiscal year. Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a two to three percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales will be down high single digits versus fiscal 2015.\nWe continue to expect constant currency core earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits for the year. Foreign exchange will reduce net earnings by approximately $1 billion versus the prior year, resulting in a nine percentage point or $0.35 per share impact on core earnings per share growth for the year.\nWith one quarter left in the year, we're tightening and improving our core earnings per share guidance range from down 3% to 8% to down 3% to 6%, which puts the midpoint of the range at $3.59 per share versus last year's core earnings per share of $3.76. Fiscal year earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of 10 percentage points from the combined impacts of Beauty deal expenses, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower non-operating income, and a higher tax rate. Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth, with meaningful growth excluding foreign exchange.\nWe expect the core effective tax rate to be 25% or higher for fiscal 2016, more than four points higher than last year, roughly a six-point headwind on core earnings per share growth. We're raising our fiscal year outlook for free cash flow to 100% or more of adjusted net earnings. We expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and the shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. In addition, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion, in total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges, and share repurchases. We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be up in the range of 46% to 51%.\nMoving briefly to 2017, David is going to join me on our next call, scheduled for Tuesday, August 2, to discuss our plans and outlook for fiscal 2017. We're currently in the early planning stages for next year and will give guidance on the next call, but there are a few things to keep in mind as you review your estimates between now and then.\nWe expect improvements in organic sales growth, though core portfolio cleanup will still be a headwind. Venezuela will be a drag on the first two quarters of the year. If currency exchange rates hold steady through next fiscal year, FX should be much more manageable than it's been for the past few years, but we'll still have a headwind on both the top and bottom line, particularly in the first two quarters.\nLikewise, if commodity costs hold at recent levels, we'll continue to see a modest tailwind in the first half or so of next fiscal year. We'll be increasing investment in R&D, in product and packaging programs, in sales capacity, and in brand awareness and trial building programs to accelerate top line growth in a responsible and sustainable way. We'll defend the relative consumer value of our brands and invest to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint, and we'll continue delivering on our commitment of cash return to shareholders. There will be an EPS benefit from shares eliminated with our category exits, though the exact amount of which will depend on when we actually close the Coty transaction. We'll obviously give more specifics on all of this on our next call, but we thought it might be helpful to offer you these early thoughts.\nTo sum up, we continue to make progress on returning P&G to balanced top and bottom line growth. We're nearing the completion of the portfolio transformation. We have created and are sustaining strong cost savings and cash productivity momentum. We're strengthening the organization and culture, and we're investing to accelerate top line growth.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will available in slides which will be posted on our website, www.PG.com, following the call. Now I'll be happy to take your questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nOlivia Tong\nGood morning, thanks. Jon, you mentioned that advertising was up 120 basis points, and it's been a while since we've seen an increase of this magnitude on the ad line. So is this a level we should expect going forward, or does it still move materially from here?\nAnd then price overall came in, so how much of that was incremental promotion, step up in sampling that you're doing, and things like that? Perhaps you can break out what the impact of price was between developed and developing markets, if you could help us out there.\nAnd then just lastly, you tightened the core EPS range, as you mentioned. But given that there's just one quarter left in the year, you left the full-year organic sales target unchanged, which obviously implies an incredibly wide range for Q4. So maybe can you refine your expectations a bit there and the main factors that impact where you fall within that range? Thanks a bunch.\nJon Moeller\nFirst of all, congratulations, Olivia, on the birth of your child, and welcome back to work. You're coming back strong with four questions in one, but it's great to have you back.\nIn terms of the advertising rates, we were up about I think 130 basis points in the quarter. We expect to be up about 140 basis points on the second half, so there will be some sequential strengthening of that comparison as we move forward. I tried to say eight or nine times in our prepared remarks that we will be investing to grow our top line. We'll be funding that with productivity and bringing to the bottom line with it.\nThere has not been a significant increase in the percentage our business being sold on promotion, nor has there been a significant increase in the depth of those promotions. We have in several markets used sales deducts as a way to adjust pricing back to competitive levels where we took more of a price increase than our competitors ultimately did, so you see that impact. And I would just think about price adjustment and value gap closures as being the explanation for the change in the price component of the top line.\nAnd as for fourth quarter guidance, we just provided it. It is what it is. And I think that the range, you rightly point out, is a wide one. That's the reality of the world that we're operating in, with very significant volatility, whether it's input costs, FX, geopolitical and geo-economic dynamics, and the consumer impacts of things like oil prices. And we're going to be living with that volatility for the foreseeable future.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.\nStephen Powers\nGreat, thanks. Hey, Jon, I think you called out $18 billion in gross-to-net spending, which is close to 27% \u2013 28% of your expected net revenues this year. And so first, can you just confirm that I heard that right? Second, assuming that I did, can you just talk about how that spending rate compares to maybe five or 10 years ago because I think it's up significantly?\nAnd then third, I'm curious how you assess the ROI on that spending. And as you optimize it going forward, how much opportunity do you see to reduce it? And then of that reduction, how much is likely to get reinvested elsewhere in the P&L as we think about the next several years? Thanks.\nJon Moeller\nSo yes, Steve, you got the number right, it's $18 billion. Yes, it has increased over time, driven in part by expansion of modern retailers on a global basis, who have brought that business model with them to other parts of the world that previously were, for example, largely a distributor and wholesaler in markets.\nThere is significant opportunity within that bucket of spend to first and foremost increase its effectiveness, ensuring that we're spending it in ways that drive category growth on a sustainable basis as opposed to short-term pantry loading, for example; shifting spending to our best product offerings, to increase the trial and repurchase rates of those items with consumers, again, not driving so much in some cases the lower end of the portfolio; the vehicles that we use to communicate in store and how those are constructed and utilized in conjunction with our retail partners. So there are just massive opportunities to improve the effectiveness of that spend as we work to reaccelerate the top line growth.\nThere are also efficiency opportunities. And this is one of those unique and wonderful costs, if there is such a thing, where if you're able to reduce it, benefits both the top line and the bottom line. But we'll be very judicious as we do that. Again, really wanting where we have opportunities to shift that from ineffective spend to effective spend is the primary activity in this space. But I'm convinced within an $18 billion spend pool, we have efficiency opportunities.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.\nWilliam Schmitz\nHi, Jon. Good morning.\nJon Moeller\nHi. Good morning, Bill.\nWilliam Schmitz\nCan you just give us some more color on the reinvestment strategy? So you talked about the increases this quarter and next quarter. But how long will the advertising restoration period last? Where are you going to focus? I think you talked about hair care, laundry, and diapers to start. And then what you trying to achieve? Because I think maybe the last two or three years you said market share is not a primary driver of the business. It's really about growing the categories profitably. But does that change as you feel more pressure to close the gap in organic growth versus your peers? Frankly, I think the scoreboard you have is organic growth, right? And so I think that's obviously really important.\nAnd then really quickly, just a housekeeping item; I know you don't have the exact numbers. But can you give us a rough cut at what you think the earnings upside is from both the Duracell and the Coty divestitures?\nJon Moeller\nYou asked a very important question, Bill. How do we think about top line growth and what are we trying to achieve there, and how do you think about the different metrics, whether it's category growth, organic sales, or market share? First and foremost, we need to accelerate our top line growth rate, and there's no debate about that.\nThe reason that we've talked a little bit about not following share out the window, we can be gaining shares in categories that are declining, and that's not going to grow our top line. What we need to be doing as innovation leaders in our categories is getting the market growing through that innovation and gaining a share of that growth. That's exactly what we're doing in Fabric Care in the U.S., for example. And it's taken a while, but it's worked extremely well. And the category is growing 4%. We're getting a disproportionate part of that growth. And that's what we are looking to do across our product categories. So it's bringing innovation to the market, which grows categories for the industry, for our retail partners, and allows us to gain a little bit of share in the process. And look, we need to be growing at the rate of the market or better, but market growth is an important element of that in terms of how attractive that growth ultimately ends up being. So it's all of the above.\nIn terms of earnings per share upside from Duracell and Coty, I think we've talked before that we plan to be non-dilutive from day one. We've been working for two years on the stranded overheads that are going to be created as a result of this. And we also expect that the portfolio that we're going to be left with is a healthier, stronger portfolio that will grow and will grow more profitably.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman\nThanks, good morning. I'm not sure if you fully answered what Bill had referenced in terms of the reset on advertising spending, so I'm guessing he's still looking for some color on thoughts around reinvestment and maybe extending beyond just it being about advertising, but also the investments in product quality and packaging and timeline for that.\nI also wanted to get color on your comments on consumer value investments, particularly in Gillette in the U.S. and Baby in the U.S. Just in Luvs, I wonder about how you think about Luvs pricing versus private label and positioning. And then for Gillette, it seemed like you were talking about the lower end of where you compete in the shaving category. But anything else you can share there would be great. Thank you.\nJon Moeller\nThanks for the save for Bill there, Lauren. Sorry, I did miss that. As I said in the earlier remarks, we're reinvesting in not just advertising. I went through three examples of sampling to generate trial, getting our best products in the hands of consumers. That's a significant portion of investment. I mentioned as well expanding our sales capacity. That's happening across some of the newer channels, but also in our existing channels, dedicating sales coverage to individual categories and sectors, which has required and will require some investment. So it's broad-based. You mentioned package. There are clear opportunities to continue to improve our first moment of truth, which is a lot about the package, and we'll continue to do that as well.\nIn terms of specific numbers for next year across those buckets, we're in the early stages of putting our plan together for next year, but our intent is clear, I think. And as I said, we'll continue to work to fund those investments through continued productivity savings as well.\nOn value equation, there's really no change here in terms of our intent to be competitive across price tiers on big businesses that matter and big markets that matter. And clearly that involves Grooming in the U.S. You mentioned Baby in the U.S. I'm not going to get into specifics about the pricing moves that will be made. I'm not allowed to do that by law. But we'll be competitive. I don't think \u2013 in fact, I'll leave it there.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.\nJohn Faucher\nThanks. Jon, you mentioned improvement in profitability, I think it was in India, over the past several years, mostly coming from I think improved manufacturing logistics in local markets. Can you talk about the state of that process? And are there still markets in emerging markets where you're losing money where you could benefit from moving that?\nAnd then I guess on the flip side of that, volumes have been weak generally. And so how do you deal with some of the stranded manufacturing capacity in some of the major markets where you've been producing this product, and is that a piece of the productivity we've been seeing for the past couple of years? And then how long do you think it takes to get to a more sustainable operating margin in some of these emerging markets on a broader basis? Thanks.\nJon Moeller\nOn the broad question of developing market margins and steady states, I can't answer that without getting into, unfortunately, FX. The answer to the question involves what happens to foreign exchange rates going forward.\nFor perspective, we've been growing constant currency earnings in developing markets well ahead of constant currency sales, going back three years ago 2x, the year after that 4x, last year 8x, this year 8x. And that reflects the things that you're describing in terms of the supply chain. It also reflects the overall productivity program and its benefits in the developing market, and it reflects a lot of work that we've been doing on our portfolio, as I described in our earlier commentary. The biggest driver of the really nice profit improvement in India has been that portfolio work. So it's all of that.\nIn terms of volume and the impact that it's had on our fixed cost rates, if you will, in the supply chain, it's definitely had an impact. The good news is that we're right in the middle of the supply transformation, and that's going to be multi-geography in nature. So that gives us an opportunity, where we need to, to rationalize that fixed cost infrastructure. At the same time, hopefully the main benefit going forward in terms of that is reacceleration of volume and sales.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi\nThanks. Jon, can you provide some context on where within the P&G organization are the pricing decisions made? And have those decisions changed, or are you planning to change who dictates local market pricing for new innovation and the core portfolio? Any context on that would be helpful.\nJon Moeller\nSo there are two forms of pricing decisions, if you think about it. One is what I'll call strategic pricing choices. That's the establishment of the pricing strategy, the price corridors you want to hold between markets, the price corridors you want to hold between competitors, whether they be branded or retail competitors. And those choices are made by our global business units, who have representation in both regions and countries, more representation in regions and countries than at the global headquarters. These are people who are very close to what's happening in the marketplace in terms of consumption, in terms of trade customers, in terms of competitors and consumers.\nAnd then there are tactical adjustments that occur on a routine basis as each day and week unfolds. And we're trying to give more flexibility to resources located closer to the action, to manipulate \u2013 or to move agilely there as they need to. So we're going to hopefully achieve the best of both, and we'll see how that works going forward.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.\nWendy Nicholson\nHi, good morning, two questions. First of all, can you talk a little bit more about China? I know you said that your business is showing some signs of improvement, down not as much given some of the premium price innovation you're doing. But how confident are you in the strategy of pursuing what sounds like almost exclusively premium price innovation? Because it does sound like from some of the other competitors out there that there is also price-based competition going on in some of your big markets. So if you can talk about China more broadly and the strategy there, that would be great.\nAnd then my second question has to do with your comment that I think we've heard. I think we heard it from Bob McDonald a few years ago that P&G was increasingly open to hiring from the outside. And I know we've had certain partnerships in R&D stuff. But in terms of actual physical new hires, outside of legal and tax and HR, I can't think of anybody on the business side who you actually have brought in from outside. So given that you've been saying that for so long, are there particular areas where you think that that is a priority? Is it marketing? Is it something in specific businesses? And why say it for so many years and then not have it actually happen? Thanks.\nJon Moeller\nSo first on China, I'm glad you asked the question you did, Wendy. That big middle of the portfolio is very important, and we're not losing sight of that. We have fantastic positions in that portion of the market which we intend to maintain and build. But we also want to take advantage of the higher growth portion of the market, which is currently the premium tiers. Fifty percent of consumption is currently in those tiers across our categories. They're growing at high single to double-digit rates. And we obviously want to participate in that, not only for the sales and volume benefit, but also for the equity halo that it provides to our brands. So it is clearly an \"and\" strategy, not an \"or\" strategy.\nYour question on our approach to bringing in talent from outside the organization, I think David was very clear about that at CAGNY that we are going to maintain broadly our promote from within and develop from within, most importantly, program. But we are going to put the right people, the best people in jobs across the organization. And when that requires that we go outside, we'll do that. We have, for example, hired a number of experienced salespeople. I mentioned building our sales capacity. As we're dedicating selling organizations to categories and sectors, there are cases where we can find more experience outside the company, people who have had 10 years' experience in a category where we may be underrepresented, and we're bringing those people in.\nThe whole area of digital marketing and media, where we need resources, we're either partnering with agencies who have that capability. In some cases, we're bringing it in. I don't think that's limited to any portion of the organization. That includes line management. But we're going to approach this deliberately. Having someone come in just for the sake of having them come in and being able to say that we're making progress there is obviously not something that interests us very much. But having the right people in the right jobs, bringing mastery to help us win across the board, we're definitely committed to.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian\nHi, good morning.\nJon Moeller\nHi, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian\nJon, as you look out to fiscal 2017, are you expecting to be able to recover some of the net negative historical gap between FX and pricing from the last couple of years through pricing? Or with the lower commodities and at least less onerous FX, is pricing not expected to be a large factor next year?\nAnd then also, I was just hoping for some commentary on if you're confident that you'll see an equivalent level of volume rebound going forward as the overall level of pricing decelerates. Thanks.\nJon Moeller\nThanks, Dara. I would expect pricing to be less of a dynamic next year than it has been the last two years, simply because at current spot rates FX would be less of a dynamic next year than it has been the last two years. I also mentioned that in some cases where we've had large gaps emerge, we'll be working to close those. But we're still seeing significant devaluation in some markets. There are still situations where we're going to be taking additional pricing where we feel that that will be matched. So it will continue to be a dynamic, but a little bit less going forward.\nOn the volume piece, I certainly don't have a crystal ball. But if I look at what's happened historically, that volume has come back over time. Sometimes it depends on the market, but volume reacceleration in markets like Latin America has been fairly quick. In other markets, for example, Russia, the last crisis it took us three years to get back from a volume standpoint. So we'll have to see.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.\nWilliam Chappell\nThanks, good morning, just two things. One, on the U.S. shaving business, can you give us a little more color? It's a focus area, both the U.S. and shaving. You've had new innovation. But do you see signs that as we move through the quarter, as we move into next year that the growth dynamics can change and maybe follow more like laundry?\nAnd then also maybe for a bigger question, I understand that next year is still a transition year and you're stepping up advertising and marketing. How long does it take to get to your kind of growth algorithms excluding stuff like Russia or a global crisis per se?\nJon Moeller\nIn terms of Grooming, this is really primarily driven by two things. One is the market, as you rightly point out, and the other is some of the promotion at primarily the lower end of the portfolio. If you look at the past three months, market consumption in tracked channels was down 4%. That's largely due to lower shaving incidences. And also that number, just the math of that number, doesn't pick up the volume from direct sellers, and that's had some impact on that tracked channel number as well. We estimate that total market growth inclusive of e-commerce sales is flat to slightly growing versus year ago, and that's an improvement versus where we've been.\nThe top end of our portfolio is doing very well. ProGlide cartridges sales grew 18% last fiscal compared to a 7% decline in the overall market, and those kinds of trends are continuing. As I mentioned, we need to do more work on the lower end of the portfolio. We also need to be more present than we are in the direct-to-consumption e-commerce channels. And we need to bring innovation equally across the portfolio and marketing equally across the portfolio, which we're committed to do.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.\nJavier Escalante\nGood morning, everyone. Jon, I think that it would be helpful if you gave us a sense in a very top line way, volume and pricing between developed and emerging markets. I know that the U.S. was up 3%, but I would like to know what's happening with Europe as well. And how was the aggregate growth in emerging markets?\nAnd in emerging markets, how much of that has been \u2013 continues to be destocking in China, or are there any other one-time in terms of wholesalers' dynamics that is impacting your growth in developing markets? And again, in China, why is destocking so protracted? Shouldn't you be better off to just purge the wholesalers' inventory and just starting to roll out whatever innovation that you have? Thank you.\nJon Moeller\nSo in terms of the breakdown between developed and developing, Javier, volume in developing was down 5%. In developed it was up 3%, which is really strong, by the way. Organic sales growth in developing was down 1%. In developed it was plus 2%. And so obviously price/mix then deductively was plus 4% in developing and minus 1% in developed.\nIn terms of the trade stocking issue in China, we're making progress. As I said, our rate of decline was halved in the quarter, and in many categories we've returned to growth. And we're doing everything we can to bring that back in a responsible way, and we'll continue to do that.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan\nThanks and good morning, everybody. I know you don't want to give too much detail on fiscal 2017, but you talk about expected organic sales growth to improve in the year. I guess given FX headwinds in the first half and your prior commentary about not focusing on market share given FX headwinds, is it fair to say that any share improvement then would be back-half weighted?\nAnd then more broadly, how should we all think about reinvestment required to return the business to top line growth? You talk about all this reinvestment on a go-forward basis, but if there's some way that we can quantify it or measure it not just in terms of what the advertising spend is on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But is there some sort of bogey out there or benchmark that helps us figure out basically where you're headed?\nJon Moeller\nFair question, Mark. Unfortunately, I have a difficult time answering that as we sit here today. We're literally just beginning the process of putting our plans together for next year. To give you some insight into that process, though, we're going to go through each of the large category/country combinations and ensure that we're efficient in terms of our investment to change the growth profile and ideally to grow at the market, and then as we go through the year try to improve that. I'm not going to call a quarter in which that's going to happen. It's going to take time, as I said in the prepared remarks. It's not going to be a straight line, but I think we'll see improvement over time.\nAnd there's no bogey in terms of a number related to investment. This is strategic planning at the category, country, and brand level that we're just beginning to do. You've seen the increased investment profile in the back half of this fiscal year. That's the only one I really have real insight into at this point. And I certainly wouldn't expect the investment levels to be lower as we go forward into next year.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.\nJoseph Altobello\nThanks, good morning, guys. First question, in terms of the 1% organic growth, can you tell us how that compared to consumption? I know it was a deceleration from last quarter, but last quarter you shipped a little bit ahead of consumption, so I was curious if that evened out in this quarter.\nAnd then secondly, just going back to Bill Chappell's question for a second, what is P&G's long-term algorithm right now given the changes in the portfolio, and how quickly can you get there? I imagine 2017 is probably too optimistic, but could we see a return to that by fiscal 2018? Thanks.\nJon Moeller\nIn terms of the relationship between consumption and shipments, you're right. We had said in January that for the December quarter there was a little bit more sell-in than consumption and you see that reflected in the third quarter, and that's where that's really reversed itself and evened out. So I think we're in a steady state at this point in the process. I think that's also an important point in understanding the difference between the 2% last quarter and the 1% this quarter in terms of organic sales growth. That and Venezuela really explain all of that change. So thanks for asking that question.\nI think it would be \u2013 in terms of the long-term algorithm that has not changed. We want to be growing with the market to slightly ahead of the market. And we believe that with continued productivity progress, that should translate into mid to high single-digit earnings per share growth. I do think that getting back fully to that algorithm next year would be difficult, but again, we're just beginning to put our plans together.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English\nHey, good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in. There we go. Can you hear me?\nJon Moeller\nYes, Jason.\nJason English\nAll right. I'm going to ask a multipart question as well. First, coming back to top line, you mentioned category growth slowing from I think 3% to 4% to roughly 3%. How much of that is volume-related versus price-related? And per your comments on the forward with FX if it holds, commodities if they hold, potentially price abating, should we expect global category growth to slow even further?\nAnd then the second question was on the savings target. This could just be a matter of semantics, but I heard you say up to $10 billion. So should we consider $10 billion as the cap and a bit of a stretch goal that may not be achieved? And also on the supply chain side, you mentioned upfront investment, savings will build in three to four years. Should we be thinking about the delivery against those savings as being further out, so a bit more protracted than what we've seen over the last $10 billion?\nJon Moeller\nGreat. So if I just look at the difference between value growth and volume growth in the markets, to get at your question of how much of it is pricing, in developed markets, if I just look over the past year basically, volume growth has actually accelerated a little bit, gone from zero to 1%. Value growth is unchanged at about 1%. And in developing markets, value growth has gone from 9% to 6%. Volume growth has gone from 2% to 1%. So I think with that set of numbers, you can put the picture together that you're looking to put together.\nIn terms of the savings target and the semantics around \"up to\", those are the words we've used since we first started talking about this back at CAGNY, and that doesn't imply a cap. There's no reason to cap, but it does imply a range of outcomes. And last time we said $10 billion, we over-delivered that. So again, there was no cap. I think $10 billion is a good number to shoot for, and I'm sure we'll get somewhere close to that, if not there. You may recall a conversation that some of us were having four years ago on this topic, and there was a lot of concern about whether we would actually get to $10 billion. And I said again, that's the right number to shoot for. And if we only get to $9 billion, I'm going to be pretty happy. And I look at it the same way this time around, so really no change there.\nOn the supply chain transformation, that particular portion of the savings will come later, as we've indicated since we started talking about supply chain transformation. I wouldn't take that as indicative of the entire program. Last time around, it was pretty evenly paced across the fiscal years. That's not the design intent. That's just how it fell, and I don't see a reason for it to fall significantly different from that this time. Remember, though, and I know you know this, we are going to be reinvesting a lot of these savings. And on a relative basis more of that investment acceleration, if you will, will occur in the early years. And then as that gets fully in place, it will obviously have less of a year-to-year impact.\nOperator\nYour final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.\nAli Dibadj\nHey, guys. I actually appreciate the tradition of always giving me the last word on the call. I hope it's a sign of respect for our work. So two things, one is I know you're pretty reluctant to talk about 2017 guidance on this call, but it would seem that analysts and investors have at least been interpreting some sort of message from you guys, given many EPS numbers have come down over the past month or so, and significantly more negatively, it would seem then, Jon, some of the messaging you've talked about at least on this call. So I'm trying to get a sense, especially with the Coty benefit or the share retirement benefit. So I'm trying to get a sense of a recap of your thinking on 2017 in terms of reinvestments and returns because clearly there are some messages being interpreted out there. And if you can balance the \"continued progress\" that your CEO says versus the not straight line that you mention and give us a little bit more color, I think it would be appreciated because there is some message getting out there, clearly.\nThe second question is, Jon, you joked a few years ago that you wouldn't want to be CFO of P&G at a time where the dividend didn't grow. And I think we're all collectively glad that it did grow. But can you give us some more color on the 1% dividend increase? Shareholders have been waiting around for you guys for quite some time. You've had some very challenging times. The macros have been very challenging. Others in your peer group suggest that they increased their dividend a little bit more aggressively than yours. And I get your dividend yield and I get your payout ratio. But what would in the end be the true cost of a slight ratings downgrade here to reward shareholders a little bit more aggressively? Thanks for those two.\nJon Moeller\nIn terms of the message that's being interpreted externally, I personally have a hard time sorting through that simply because of the very wide range that exists in estimates right now. So I'm not sure what message is being received. In terms of the message we're providing, it's very much the one you ascribed to David just a minute ago, which is continued progress on both the top and bottom line as well as our cash flow. And obviously, we want to accelerate all of that as quickly as we're able, but do it in a sustainable, responsible way. And as I indicated, we're just putting our plans together for next year, and we'll see what amount of progress we make.\nOur competitors don't sit still. Markets are volatile, and so that's where the not straight line comment comes in. I just think that's a reflection of reality. The Coty benefit in terms of the share retirement will depend on exactly when those shares get retired, but there should definitely be a benefit associated with that, and we view that as part of the overall equation.\nIn terms of the dividend increase, as you know, we're very committed to the principle of cash return to shareholders. Over the last 10 years, as I mentioned earlier, we've returned $118 billion. This year between dividend and share repurchases and share exchange, we'll effectively return $15 billion to $16 billion.\nThere is not a lot of juice, if you will, to the amount of cash available from a borrowing standpoint between our current credit rating and one or two notches down. So to do that to the credit rating for a small amount of additional dividend increase is not something that made a lot of sense to us. We were very happy to increase the dividend. We remain committed to cash return to shareholders, but we also need to reflect reality in our dividend planning, significant FX headwinds. We are creating a smaller company, and our earnings per share are below year ago. And we have a responsibility there, as you'll appreciate as well. So it's a balancing of those two things. I completely get and understand the question. It's a very fair one, but that's where we net it out. I'll leave it there.\nJon Moeller\nThank you, everybody, for questions this morning. We'll be available for the balance of the week to talk through any of this with you. We're very happy about the progress that we're making, but we clearly understand we have more to do. Thanks a lot.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.\n\n",

Welcome to the QEP Resources Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to your host, William Kent, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nWilliam Kent\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the QEP Resources' Second Quarter 2019 Results Conference Call. With me today are Tim Cutt, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Doleshek, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. If you've not done so already, please go to our website, qepres.com, to obtain copies of our earnings release, which contains tables with our financial results along with the slide presentation with supporting materials.\nIn today's conference call, we will use certain non-GAAP measures, including EBITDA, which is referred to as adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release and SEC filings, and free cash flow. These measures are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release and SEC filings. In addition, we'll be making numerous forward-looking statements. We remind everyone that our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe refer everyone to our more robust forward-looking statement disclaimer and discussion of these risks facing our business in our earnings release and SEC filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tim.\nTimothy Cutt\nThank you, Will, and good morning, and thank you for joining the call. Today, I'll begin the call with an update to the strategic alternatives process before providing a brief operational update and a first-look into our 2020 business plan.\nAs you read in our second quarter earnings release this morning, we have concluded our comprehensive review strategic alternative and the board has determined the best value for shareholders is to move forward on a same-loan basis. As you are likely aware of the current market conditions have significantly impacted the ability of many kind of parties that transacted these levels that would deliver our appropriate value for our shareholders.\nWhile I would primarily focus today's commentary on our performance and go-forward strategy, I will first share a few remarks about the review process itself. Upon receiving an unsolicited proposal to acquire the company in January, we engaged in a review of a wide range of strategic alternatives in an effort to maximize value for shareholders.\nWithout getting in the granular detail, since we launched the strategic review process in February 2019, our Board of Directors met numerous times and with the help of the team of experienced financial and legal advisers reviewed a range of potential transactions. Ultimately with today's market dynamics coupled with a strength of our operations both in the Permian and the Williston basins, our board determined that the best path to create long-term value for shareholders is as a standalone company executing our new strategic plan.\nAs we evaluated opportunities, it was apparent but none of the potential transactions recognize the intrinsic value of our assets and we believe that with our new strategy, we can optimize these assets to deliver long term value to our shareholders.\nWith that, let's talk about the go-forward strategy. As a standalone company, we are laser-focused on generating free cash flow, strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. We are confident in our ability to deliver on this commitment as a result of the improved performance and deliverability of our high quality oil-dominant asset-base -- a significant decrease in drilling completion of facility costs, as well as the successful and sustainable reduction of corporate overhead in the first half of 2019.\nSince coming on board with QEP in January, I've been keenly focused on reducing corporate overhead and the capital intensity of the business. As a result of actions taken during the first quarter, G&A expense dropped by $32 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 50% compared to the first quarter, keeping us on-track to deliver on our goal of reducing normalized expense by approximately 45% between year-end 2018 and 2020.\nWe have implemented the majority of the plan reductions to G&A expense and are confident that we'll be able to deliver our sub $3 per BOE target for 2020. Despite these significant reductions, we believe that we have retained a highly-talented technical business and operating team as well as the necessary systems, controls, processes and infrastructure to successfully execute our future plans.\nOur operations team continue to deliver continuous improvement on both cost and efficiency front, which is positively impacting cycle time and capital efficiency. As a result of those work, drilling completion and facility cost have continued to decrease and we have confidence in our ability to deliver producing wells for approximately $1.5 million less than in 2018 in the Permian basin.\nOur average drilling complete cost is now below $6 million per well per 10,000 foot lateral, with drilling time from spud to TV [ph] averaging less than 12 days. Our ability to treat produced water and deliver high-quality frac water at low cost represents another opportunity to create value for our shareholders through the generation of additional cash flow from third parties. We're in a process of evaluating partnerships, opportunities and work with water companies to recover investment capital and leverage their water-gathering expertise. We expect to provide some clarity on this in our next update call.\nWe expect to further reduce overhead and operating cost moving forward by leveraging the continuous improvement mindset that the organization has adopted. Given the reduction in G&A, improvements in capital efficiency and our improving well and DSU performance, we now have a clear line of sight to a runway of free cash flow generation going forward. I will now turn my comments for our operations in the quarter and a brief look into 2020.\nI'm pleased to report that operational performance during the second quarter in all categories was in-line with, or better than guidance. Oil and condensate production in the Permian basin increased by 12% quarter-over-quarter. Permian GAAP sales were also higher than forecast due to the addition of midstream facilities, primarily compression, which improved our ability to capture natural gas from the wells that reduced the need to clear. QEP remains confident that the tank-style development is the best method to develop our acreage Midland basin. While the EMP industry continues to debate the best development approach, we believe that our results confirm that this methodology is the most effective and efficient way to develop our acreage when implemented using proper spacing assumptions and completion techniques. The DSUs completed in 2019 drilled our go-forward's basing assumptions are currently producing on or above their predicted production profile, enabling us to stay slightly ahead of our volume plan.\nWe have released the third rig in the Permian and plan to move forward with a two-rig program into 2020. Our future development plan initially develops the issues in the derisked areas of County Line in 2020 before returning to Mustang Springs in 2021. We expect to complete between 60 and 65 wells in 2020. The two-rig program allows to grow old production between 2019 and 2020 by approximately 8%.\nOur plan develops from approximately 6% of our inventory in 2020 and delivers a compound annual growth rate over five years of greater than 5%. Under this plan, the Permian generates cash flow moving forward above $50 oil price. Although current market conditions are not supported, the plan retains flexibility to grow the Permian by up to approximately 15% per annum with a full rig program.\nFinally on the Permian. We are very encouraged by the results of recent offset operator activity around the Robertson Ranch acreage and we're looking forward to developing this area in the future. Now onto the Williston. Our Williston basin assets continue to provide cash flow during the quarter despite the anticipated declining production. We expect the forecasted quarter-to-quarter production decline will be reversed when the seven new Vegas wells are put on production early in the fourth quarter. Drilling activity in the Vegas bed is now finished and we will begin completing these wells in early August.\nAs we have continued to evaluate the performance of our refracs in the Williston, we have changed our philosophy regarding drilling in-field wells on South Antelope. We now believe that refracing existing wells is the most economical way to develop the remaining reserves on South Antelope while accommodation of new wells or refracs on our acreage on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation is the best way to perceive there. We have identified approximately 100 remaining drilling locations primarily in Fort Berthold and more than 100 high quality frac candidates particularly between South Antelope and Fort Berthold, all delivering strong economic returns down to a $50 oil price.\nIt is also important to note that there are significant upside to this inventory channel, depending on commodity and price environment. We're excited to execute a balanced refrac and drilling development program over the next several years and we expect the Williston to continue to be a strong cash flow generating asset for the next 10 plus years. The Williston basin 2020 development plan will allow us to maintain a flat annual production compared to 2019. We anticipate being able to maintain relatively flat production for the next seven years with an annual capital budget of approximately $135 million to $165 million per annum.\nWith that high-level overview of recent performance and our forward plans, I'll turn the call over to Richard to discuss our financial performance.\nRichard Doleshek\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'll quickly give you some color on the second quarter results, a better 2019 guidance and have conditional [ph] thoughts around our 2020 plans before we open up the call for Q&A.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we generated $166.5 million with just EBITDA. The higher adjusted EBITDA compared to the first quarter is reflected among other things: lowered G&A expense, LOE transportation and taxes and higher fuel level [ph] prices which were up $3.69 per BOE compared to the first quarter.\nFor the second quarter we reported net income of $49 million, driving that income was a $55 million unrealized gain associated with our commodity derivatives portfolio, at the end of the second quarter, the derivatives portfolio with the net liability of $1 million compared to a net liability of $55 million at the end of the first quarter.\nIn addition, we reported an $18 million down sale primarily related to the Haynesville Cotton Valley. We continue to invest in commodity, derivative contracts during the second quarter and as of June 30, we hold contracts excluding basis swaps totaling 14.6 million barrels of oil which covers about 67% of forecast in 2019 oil production and off 31% in the forecast of 2020 oil production.\nWith regard to our balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, total assets were $5.5 billion, shareholder equity was about $2.7 billion. In total that was approximately $2.1 billion, all of which was our senior notes. We had nothing outstanding our revolving credit facility and had $97 million of cash at the end of the quarter. Excluding cash, we have the ability to incur about $550 million for the additional investment at the end of the second quarter.\nIn terms of 2019 guidance, there are several updates. With regard to overall production guidance for the year, based on better recent low results to improved gas recoveries in the Permian basin in the first half of the year, we are increasing our overall collection guidance to a range of 29.9 million to 31 million barrels of oil equivalent, a 4% increase at the midpoint of our previous guidance. We are increasing these oil guidance for the full year to a range of 21 million to 21.5 million barrels, an increase of 250,000 barrels at the midpoint just like the divestiture of several non-core asset in the Williston basin that were forecasted to contribute approximately 150,000 barrels for the last seven months of 2019.\nWe are increasing our guidance for natural gas lines for 2019 to the range of 28 to 30 DCF, a 9% increase at the midpoint of our previous guidance which reflects our improved natural gas capture rates in the Permian basin.\nFinally, our guidance for NGL volumes for 2019 is increased to 4.25 million to 4.5 million barrels and leverage then increase at the midpoint from the previous guidance. The team's significant stride [ph] in cost reductions and improved efficiencies position us to lower our 2019 capital guidance by $50 million at the midpoint. In addition we are lowering our 2019 G&A guidance by $5 million at midpoint. There's additional details at our guidance in our earnings release.\nAs Tim mentioned, the company's 2020 plan is structured to being cash flow positive at $50 oil. We expect that the development plan will deliver approximately $120 million of free cash flow with a $55 oil and approximately $185 million of free cash flow at $60 oil before the expected tax refund of $37 million. At $55 oil, our free cash flow yield is expected to be around 10% based on a $5 share price.\nOur ability to generate free cash flow enables us to improve our balance sheet and complementary capital shareholders. We're extremely pleased to announce the reinstatement of the quarter dividend at $0.02 per share which represents a dividend yield of 1.6% based on a $5 share price. In addition, we expect to fund the $52 million of senior notes that mature in March 2020 with cash in the balance sheet.\nClearly, the extent [ph] of free cash flows generated will be dependent on the price of oil, but even with the dividend came and our senior notes we're paying next year, we have sufficiently decreased our cost structures such that we expect a cash flow positive in 2020 at $50 oil price, allowing us to further strengthen our balance sheet.\nI will now turn the call back to Tim to provide a brief summary before opening the call for questions.\nTimothy Cutt\nThanks, Richard. In summary, we're committed to delivering a low-cost, highly competitive investment opportunity through our high-return development program in the Permian basin and the execution of a selected drilling and refrac program in the Williston basin. We believe that the combination of our high quality assets with the strength of our operations teams will allow us to deliver on this commitment. Our concerted efforts to reduce corporate overhead and fair level expenses of soundly position the business to deliver a free cash flow with a competitive yield to our investors and return capital to shareholders through a dividend program and payment of debts.\nOur teams have delivered outstanding performance during the past six months while we have been reviewing the strategic alternatives and I want to thank each of them for their patience and commitments as we work through this process. I'm enthusiastic about our product future ahead and look forward to sharing our ongoing progress on the execution of our new strategy and results in the months ahead.\nWe'll now turn it over to questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Gabe Daoud with Cowen & Company.\nGabe Daoud\nHey. Good morning, Tim, good morning, everyone. I was just maybe curious on the dividend and kind of how you balance that with leverage and then all sorts of the longer term plan through 2020 with the commodity still being kind of volatile. I guess maybe just discuss a little bit about your comfort level and reinstating the dividend and then how you balance that with the plan through 2021?\nRichard Doleshek\nHey, Dave. It's Richard. I think the dividend is the tangible demonstration of our confidence and the ability to generate free cash flow and our credit that we turned to capital to shareholders. You're right, the commodity is volatile and that's 70% of our production coming for the rest of this year about 45% covered so far for next year that gives us solid foundation to generate that free cash flow. It just felt like it was the right thing to do in terms of again, a tangible demonstration of our confidence in generating free cash. You've got claiming cash to fund the maturity that's coming due in March and we'll continue to 'organically' delever even if we don't do anything on the liability management front.\nGabe Daoud\nGot it. Okay, thanks, Richard. That's helpful. And then I guess the review process complete, how does that impact your thinking just in terms of the Permian water infrastructure asset? If that still potentially represents a divestiture candidate? And then also I guess just taking to the Permian. The water asset question and also just sticking to the Permian in terms of spacing some of the issues that you highlighted, does that represent the appropriate spacing as you think about development moving forward?\nTimothy Cutt\nI'll take the last one first. The spacing, I think we're dialing in not only in Mustang Spring, but also over in County Line, so the spacings we represented there or now or what we believe are appropriate. Good news is some of the other saying like the [indiscernible] are some of the very positive results and so I don't want to proclude going through a little more downspacing in some of those, but one of the main bodies of the Will Camp A and Will Camp B in the Spraberry Shale, I think we're getting that plus or minus about right.\nOn the water infrastructure, we're pretty excited about that. For a fairly small company, we got a good solid infrastructure. We're processing water lower than most, so there's a big margin there. You can bring more water in the system, upsize a little bit and then turn it back out and settle back clean frac water back out in the market. I think there's a good cash flow opportunity. So we're looking at the best way to leverage the asset. Those infrastructures are selling for a pretty high premium, so we'll obviously take a look at that, but we think the balance between keeping a very low LOE, keeping our frac calls down and doing all that maintains some control in there, but partnering with a company that's much more skilled at governing water and signing up those contracts, working with us, we can process it and we can move it. But I think that may be ultimately what we decide to do. We hope in the next quarter, we get all that buttoned up and we're able to get an update in the next quarterly update.\nGabe Daoud\nOkay, great. That's super helpful. Thank you. Tim, I'll sneak in one more if I could. Just on the rig allocation in 2020, just I guess with the focus on County Line. Is there any particular reason why maybe moving away from Mustang Springs and then what about the Robertson Ranch acreage block? Is there any thought on when development could start there?\nTimothy Cutt\nYes. On County Line, the only reason we're going over there is we do have some obligation drilling with the university lands. We're excited to get back there. The Spraberry Shale in County Line is probably one of the best horizons we have to develop, we can develop that a bit higher density and we look forward to getting October [ph] there. We're in a really good stopping point. If you look at our maps, we finished the tank at the end of the row with the issue 12, so it's a really good stopping point. This will give us a chance to look back at all the data, come back in a year and get after that again.\nRobertson Ranch is pretty interesting. Obviously were super excited about when we bought it, now we have a lot of operations going on and each of the horizons are really showing really strong results. So we're going to be gathering all of that offset information and we're anxious to get down there. We got a pretty big inventory. It takes us a little while to get down there, but we're contemplating doing individual test wells and potential DSU tests in the future. But we're probably a couple years out from being down.\nGabe Daoud\nOkay, great. Thanks again, Tim.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Neil Dingman with SunTrust.\nNeil Dingman\nGood morning, guys. I'm just wondering, Tim, if you could address. You guys are doing a nice job with cost and efficiencies getting closer to free cash flow. So my question would be how you address the sustainability of the free cash flow given the tank style development that you all plan with the Permian?\nTimothy Cutt\nYes. I think that really does have to sustain it. When you look at our drilling completion cost and speed of drilling, it's really nothing with the tank-style. We can get these things in place, a low-cost and cheaply. Where we have a real advantage on the tank-style from a cost perspective is on our facility. So we're no longer going to complete these to where we go across the road, turn the corner and come back; we're going to do this more in a doing instead of the issues across, coming back to the other side and going across.\nAs we do that, we're able to use the facility as we've developed on the previous DSUs when we come back just below it. One of the issues recently, we had up to 57 wells that we're able to access the single DSU facility. I think that's a very efficient way to do that. I think the tank-style actually helps us maintain that efficiency to keep the cost down and we've done a lot more the last seven months. I think there's more to come when things are motivated. Everybody understands the need to deliver the cash. So I think the tank-style just enables us to carry forward. I think Richard has some...\nRichard Doleshek\nNeil, as a follow up, if you go back to Tim's comment about the well cost at $6 million in the Permian, that's around the numbers of about $1.5 million drilling before. If you think about 60 wells, $1.5 million cheaper, that's $90 million of incremental free cash right there. The G&A reduction that's round the numbered $70 million, that begins to tell you how sustainable that free cash flow is. We're very confident during free cash flow. As we've said in the prepared remarks, we're down at $50 a barrel. It's through a combination of what we've done with regard to the drill bit as well as what we've done to the organizational structure. So from a sustainability standpoint, we feel very, very good about, it's just not flash and a pan.\nNeil Dingman\nVery helpful, guys. And then just lastly a little follow up on the Bakken. I know you've got plan with the one rig and the seven wells. Just wanted to sort of address the depletion that you have there. In the past you've mentioned -- I forget, the number was three or four -- or what you've thought was an optimal level to really attack that area. I'm just wondering now that with the plan finished, any new thoughts or color you could just talk about attacking the Bakken? Thanks so much.\nTimothy Cutt\nYes. I think we've got a good detail in the pack, but we've studied the Bakken hard and we just kind of looked at over the next five years and said that's what matters most for now. We have quite a large inventory that you can develop at higher prices, but if you think about a $50 to $55 price, we've got a really solid inventory of about 100 refracs and 100 drill well. The drill wells are primarily in Fort Berthold and then the refracs are split evenly between South Antelope and Fort Berthold. The South Antelope refracs that we completed in 2018 are continuing to deliver very well, the economics are strong, the lightest ones we did with the best technology, you have an F&D cost of kind of $8 to $10, and so we're going to do probably a bit more early on, just proportional share of the refracs versus drilled wells and then carry that on at about plus or minus $150 million a year. We can maintain production flat for basic line on the Williston at about 30% per annum and that's a pretty typical decline and we're able to maintain through work over our activity and such that the decline -- all of that activity I'm talking about, the refracs and occasional wells are enough of an upside wedge to keep that production flat for a long time. And the final thing I'd say is that's a very casual cause of asset and we can maintain that as cash flow positive very easily for the next 10 years, we believe.\nNeil Dingman\nGreat. Thanks so much, guys.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Kashy Harrison with Simmons Energy.\nKashy Harrison\nGood morning and thank you for taking my questions. The first one for me, when are you going to use the incremental free cash flow in excess of the dividend to do in 2020?\nTimothy Cutt\nI'll start off and then turn it over to Richard. We did have a $50 million debt maturity coming due -- that will be paid off and then obviously we have additional debt maturity coming the following year. I'll turn it to Richard to build that out.\nRichard Doleshek\nYes, Kashy, it's going to be the combination of managing the balance sheet, the dividend in total if it's not increased on annual basis is up $20 million. Tim mentioned the $50 million maturity, so that's $70 million right there, the $120 million. The remainder, we'll figure out what to do with it with regard to the balance sheet or other -- there's pretty little bit more money into the Permian water to get it through where we want it to be, comp and monetization. So it's really more through a variety of things.\nTimothy Cutt\nBut our team is not to increase our activity. We have spent a lot of time over the last six months looking at the activity levels and quite frankly when we talked in April, I thought we were going to have a higher volume and a $60 oil price to deliver this cash flow with all the significant reductions we can now deliver at this. So you think about only working off for the next few years, 5% or 6% of our inventory for the year, that gives you a long life. You're not pressed against the wall on inventory and you're delivering a very positive cash flow. So I'd say stability is key. We're going to do a smart thing. We'll be opportunistic, but we really are focused on this level of activity to raising the Permian, fracing periodically, drilling periodically in the Williston and that's the only way we're going to have confidence of delivering a very consistent cash flow.\nKashy Harrison\nGreat. And then maybe two quick ones for Richard. How should we think about maintenance CapEx to hold your Q4 oil rates flat into 2020? And how should we think about the oil price at which your program is cash flow neutral in 2020 and 2021?\nRichard Doleshek\nKashy, I don't have the exact number. We're still cash flow positive, $50 a barrel and of course some of that supported by the drilling program and if I had to use ballpark, I'd say we're probably cash flow neutral in the high 40s. At 45 we're not cash flow neutral in 2020, we don't have any derivative position on for 2021 yet. We will waive through sort of recovery before starting to putting those derivatives on. That's kind of a quick guess at the cash flow neutrality price. The first part of your question was what, Kashy? Sorry.\nKashy Harrison\nThen the maintenance CapEx to hold the Q4 rate.\nRichard Doleshek\nIn Tim's prepared remarks we talked about the Bakken. The Bakken is going to drill about 8 million barrel of oil this year, keeping Bakken flat at 8 million to 9 million barrels. This is $130-ish million range. But flatten the Permian, it's probably $300 million to $350 million so that incremental capital that we're spending for infrastructure et cetera, it only grows the Permian by about 10%. I think if you look at our capital for next year, there's probably $100 million to $150 million that's growth driven grosses the remainder used to sort of keep production flat.\nTimothy Cutt\nThe only thing I've built on the derivative position is typically we would end the year about 50% covered. We're already at 46% and the average price is 58% to 85%. So we feel good about the position we're in now. We think a lot of other opportunities hopefully before year end and certainly into next year to build that up to closer to 70% plus. We feel good about what we've done to secure our ability to carry on through this year and carry it all the way in through 2020.\nKashy Harrison\nGot it. If I could just sneak one more, creep one in, could you remind us or could you tell us what the cash flows associated with the Permian water infrastructure assets were during the second quarter?\nRichard Doleshek\nYes Kashy, we don't break it out and it's all inter-company. It wouldn't be reflected as if we had charging ourselves $1 a barrel or $1.50 a barrel for water. So we don't get the number and then get the internal. It's not going to be as we did give you the number. I told you it was $2 million of EBITDA to QEP. I think that gives you the wrong idea that, 'Oh, that's only worth $100 million with a 10x multiple because we're handling ourselves'. As we get closer to trying to do something with that, if we decide to do something with that, clearly we'll get more visibility as to what that system would do if it were to standalone on third party system.\nKashy Harrison\nAll right. Thank you.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Tim Rezvan with Oppenheimer.\nTim Rezvan\nGood morning, folks. Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping to follow up a little bit on that last question, just trying to understand Williston basin production. Richard, you said $8 million barrels of oil this year. If we assume that 60% oil cut, that gets you to about 32,000 barrels a day. Is that roughly how you had thinking about that maintenance production level going forward for the Williston?\nTimothy Cutt\nThat's exactly right. I think you got your numbers just about exactly right and I think what we quoted on our script is 135,000 to 165,000 depending on the year and depending how much infrastructure you have to put in, years where you're doing primarily refracs, leveraging the infrastructure is going to be closer to 135,000. Years where you have to put facility infrastructure associated with drilling the new wells. It will be a little higher. But overall, over the next seven years, we feel confident with that level of activity, we keep the numbers flat about what you quoted.\nTim Rezvan\nOkay. Thank you for that. And then I was hoping to get more clarity on comments you gave in your prepared remarks on the Midland basin. Did you say that 8% oil growth in 2020 from the Permian would come from developing 6% of your inventory? Was that the comments you gave?\nTimothy Cutt\nYes. In 2020, County Line, when you look at the 60-65 wells or drilled, that develops about 6% of our remaining inventory and we get about an 8% year-on-year growth.\nTim Rezvan\nOkay. Just to extrapolate that, then you're looking at about 1,000 locations is what you believe in your inventory?\nRichard Doleshek\nWe kind of guess you might do that. 60 to 65, that gives you 1,000 to 1,100. We're in that area code. Obviously when we look at the other zones like being -- giving us extraordinarily good results right now [indiscernible]. We're looking all the offset activity around Robertson Ranch. That number will continue to change with time, but we're feeling good in that area.\nTim Rezvan\nOkay. Thank you for that. And then if I could sneak one last one in, just to hit on the dividend again. I was wondering if you could talk about if there's a tactical element to this to defend the equity given it's been under pressure? The reason I asked is interest expense for the company is almost $4.50 of BOE and if we annualize first half of 2019 EBITDA, we see leverage lurking around 3.5x. So can you talk about why you felt the need to do this now as opposed to when you're in a little more of a stronger position?\nTimothy Cutt\nTim, I think it's a combination of all of those things you just mentioned. I think it is tactical. I think it is a tangible -- like I said earlier, tangible demonstration, our belief in our ability to doing free cash flow. I think it also is reflective of what we think our cash position is going to be on a go-forward basis and how we're going to manage that leverage on a go-forward basis. We don't have anything drawn in the revolver, we don't forecast what need to be drawn on the revolver for the foreseeable plain drives, and then how we manage the $50 million that's due next year, the $400 million next due in 2021. We're just balancing how we're deleveraging that with comparisons to what we're going to do with the cash.\nI think the first half of the year is challenging. The $119 million need to be in the first quarter, it was third with over $60 million of G&A as a result of restructuring cost. If you annualize the second quarter or more importantly the second half of the year, your leverage is pointing well south of 3x we forecasted to be by the time we get to let's call it midpoint of 2020 to be plus or minus 2x and the goal would be down into 1.5x and we'll be opportunistic about how we manage that deleveraging, but certainly the free cash flow generation of the company, what we can do with that money relative to the $19 million or $20 million of dividend, it seem like a good balance.\nTim Rezvan\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Betty Jiang with Credit Suisse.\nBetty Jiang\nGood morning. I just have a quick question on 2020. It seems to me that CapEx is roughly flattish the next year while you're doing a high level of activity just by couple of wells in the Permian and also a much higher frac activity in the Bakken. Is there incremental cost savings that's being assumed in 2020 or outlook that's not in 2019? Just trying to understand what's been captured and what's not.\nTimothy Cutt\nIf you look at the deck we talk about where we save money on drilling completions and facility cost, we've been bringing those cost down all year what we predicted forward and there is kind of a mid-year '19 forward. So the activity at the beginning of this year was at the higher dollar amount. We're bringing that down, we're continuing to bringing that down into a run rate that we feel we're pretty close to, about $1.5 million to $1.7 million per well delivered and that includes all facility cost, lifting cost, drilling and completions. So yes, when you do the math and you run that through and you also look at what we're trying to do is leverage existing facilities and lower that capital intensity, all of that is coming together to lower the intensity for wells. So I think you're right, we could certainly help you out plan with some of the most detailed map [ph].\nBetty Jiang\nGot it. But generally fair to say it's reflecting your current cost structure in both ways?\nTimothy Cutt\nAbsolutely.\nBetty Jiang\nOkay. And then a follow up on a debt. Is it fair to assume that the base case has put the $450 million maturity on the rip over the next two years? And then could you remind me, does the current revolver reflect sale of Haynesville?\nTimothy Cutt\nYes. The $550 million incremental debt capacity under the covenant does perform out the EBITDA contribution of the Haynesville assets as well as the PD9 contribution of the Haynesville assets. So the incremental debt capacity that we quote is pro forma for everything that we've sold in the last trailing 12 months. The 450 debt maturing is $52 million next year and $397 million in 2020. We do not introspect putting all that or even half of that on the revolver if we were just to let those mature as they're forecasted to ensure they're scheduled to mature just because of the cash balance that we expect to have, the combination of $75 million tax refund that were forecasted in the fourth quarter as well as the free cash flow that's generated by the operations next year, the combination of cash available to us from operating activity and other sources. We're projecting that we're actually not going to put the bulk of that $400 million on the revolver when it matures.\nBetty Jiang\nGreat. Thanks for that.\nOperator\nWe have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Tim Cutt for closing remarks.\nTimothy Cutt\nThank you very much and thanks for joining the call today. We're excited about the competitive position we have today and the substantial opportunities ahead of us. We look forward to continuing the dialog with all of you in the coming days and weeks. Have a good day. Thank you very much for joining us.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\n\n",

Thank you, everybody for joining us this afternoon. I'm Aaron Rakers on the IT Hardware and Semiconductor analysts here at Wells Fargo. I'm extremely excited to have with us Keith White, the General Manager of HPE\u2019s GreenLake Cloud Services offerings. First of all, Keith, thank you so much for joining us. It's going to be a great discussion, given the importance of Green Lake and HPE.\nBut before we go to you, I've been told that you know, let's pass it over to Marcus Kupferschmidt, to kind of run through a quick, this Safe Harbor.\nMarcus Kupferschmidt\nThanks, Aaron. Before we start, let me take a moment to read our disclosures. You'll hear some forward-looking statements in today's discussion. These are based on risks and assumptions that are described in our annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Our actual results could differ materially, and we assume no obligation to update. More details can be found on our website investors@hpe.com, and our recent Q4 earnings announcement, press release dated December 1.\nWith that Aaron, let me turn it back to you.\nAaron Rakers\nPerfect, Marcus, you nailed it. That was great. So Keith, let's, you know, first of all, again, thank you for joining us. Again, your role as Senior Vice President and General Manager of HP Enterprises, GreenLake efforts [ph] For those in the audience that aren't familiar with Keith, I'd love for him to go back, maybe take one step back and go, you know, through his background, I think you joined from Microsoft back early part of this year. And in that context, I'd love to understand of what, you know, maybe your experience of Microsoft kind of brings to HPE as they go down this journey with GreenLake.\nKeith White\nNo, no, it's a great question. And you know, frankly, yeah, I was at Microsoft for 25 plus years, had the fit of doing a phenomenal set of different jobs and careers there I ran. The Office business for a period of time in the United States, I ran our embedded and appliance business before we were putting Windows on phones.\nI was also leaning up our public sector business. And that was really targeting sort of government, healthcare and education. But my last role at Microsoft was basically leading the Intelligent Cloud business. And so that, as many of you know, is our sort of Azure Windows Server, SQL Server, Dev Tools, sort of back office type scenario. So I did that for about the last seven or eight years of my time at Microsoft. And so super fortunate to have the opportunity.\nAnd my portion of that was not engineering and was not product management. But I was the lead on our - what's called our solution area side, which is all the sales, go to market, partner ecosystem development standpoint, for that - for the Azure business.\nAnd, yes, I joined HPE in January of 2020. And, you know, frankly, I had been talking to customers for quite some time about how they are digitally transforming, modernizing their environments, and how the industry has really accelerated to what I'd call a hybrid and multi cloud world to meet their needs.\nAnd, you know, so I had that background with Azure. And what we were doing at Microsoft from a public cloud standpoint, and from our customers from a hybrid standpoint, with the Windows Server, SQL Server side.\nBut at the same time what was really compelling with respect to coming to HPE is that, Microsoft went through a pretty significant transformation, if you will. You might recall, they were on a three year enterprise agreement approach with their customers. They were selling Office and Windows, traditional transactional type partners that they had in the Disti and Reseller\u2019s.\nAnd customers have really sort of pivoted to digital transformation, workloads and vertical solutions, consumption based, usage based IT, customer success, and really selling through and with a much broader partner ecosystem. And so - I was firsthand at that at Microsoft. And frankly, it's the exact and very close to the exact same thing that we're going through here at HPE. And so being part of that, and getting the chance to lead that transformation here as well, is really an exciting opportunity.\nAaron Rakers\nThat's a great overview and great background to bring to HPE. Let's start from there and a discussion of, you know, for those that aren't as familiar with what HPE is doing with GreenLake. How much that's expanded within a strategy at HPE, where we're at today, where kind of we're going, if you kind of put your forward looking hat on, you know, over the next whatever timeframe you want to think about, you know, from a portfolio perspective?\nKeith White\nNo, I think that's great. And first off, as you're probably aware, we did highlight that HPE GreenLake is one of our fastest growing businesses, especially as we're seeing this significant shift in the market to a consumption-driven model for IT.\nAnd so yesterday, we announced our Q4 results. And the fact of the matter is our ARR was up 20 \u2013 I am sorry, 30% year-over-year, around 585, which was fantastic to see. And as you know, GreenLake makes up the majority of that.\nBut if you think about the sort of customer set, the rapid growth of the public cloud has really driven a strong set of what I call customer expectations about and how they want to consume and simplify their IT going forward.\nAgain, they're digitally transforming, they're modernizing their environments, and they want that cloud experience. And when I think about that, I think about automated, self-serve capabilities, they want the cloud economics, so they want it pay as they go, they want capacity available to them very, very quickly.\nAnd they want the cloud management piece of it as well, right? They want the ability to have someone manage it all for them on the back end, updates, keeping it always up to date and available. So that they can free up valuable resources that they have to really focus on business critical needs.\nAnd so GreenLake what that does for folks is it brings this modern cloud experience to customers apps, data and workloads in their location. So on-prem, so in their data center, in a co-lo or at the edge. And we do this in an automated, self-serve, pay for what you use, scale up and down. And we manage it all for them through HPE and our partners.\nSo you know these solutions are workload optimized for the customer. So we're leveraging the best of HPE across our hardware, our software, third-party components and software and then of our point next services in our HPE financial services organization to bring this all together, so we take the best of that, and deliver these to customers in as little as 14 days to really meet the customer's needs. And so you asked like - yeah, go ahead.\nAaron Rakers\nGo ahead. No, okay, keep going.\nKeith White\nYeah, I was going to say, IDC, expects about 70% of current and future workloads to stay on-prem. And if you listen to AWS in their keynote last, I guess, is earlier this week, they talked about even the 90% scenario that they're seeing with their customers. So the reality is, is it's a hybrid world, and it's going to be a hybrid scenario.\nAnd those are happening for very specific reasons, right? Data, gravity, data latency, security, compliance, and regulatory scenarios, existing apps that are connected and entangled. And so GreenLake really gives that cloud experience without a cost risks are time to move all that stuff to the cloud, as well as it helps free up capital for customers, and boosts their operational and financial flexibility, because they're paying for what they use, and again, freeing up that talent for what they need. And so our goal is to make sure that we're a key part of that hybrid solution for that 70% to whatever percent with GreenLake.\nAaron Rakers\nAnd I think the company is been pretty clear like this, this strategy is going to proliferate across the product portfolio. And I think you recently came out with support for cloud, you know, VDI\u2026\nKeith White\nYeah.\nAaron Rakers\nWhere do we stand, as far as the GreenLake umbrella that has a service umbrella, kind of going through or across entire product portfolio for HPE later?\nKeith White\nYeah, perfect question there. And, you know, in essence, we've delivered what we call a set of cloud services. So again, these are automated, they're self-serve for the customer point-and-click, they're metered. And specifically, we've launched this year, cloud services around sort of the core foundation, if you will, so compute, storage and networking, which makes up most of everything. And then we've brought this cloud service capability also to virtual machines, and to containers. So those are becoming obviously much more prevalent as we go.\nAdditionally, to your point, we've delivered a set of core workloads. So one of the big things that's happening out there, you know, data is becoming such a critical part. So we've delivered machine learning operations to help data scientists and analytics type scenarios, if you will.\nWe've delivered this VDI, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure that you mentioned. A lot of growth with respect to everyone working from home, companies wanting to ensure a secure desktop and a secure connection, so that customers - their employees can be productive in that sense.\nAnd then you might have noticed, we also announced a partnership with SAP earlier this year. So GreenLake is now - HP GreenLake is now part of the Hex Customer Edition. So this is they're migrating a number of their customers to SAP HANA. And what they found was a lot of people wanted to keep that on-prem, again, because of security latency, the apps that they had built, et cetera. And so we're excited to partner with them on SAP with GreenLake.\nSo going forward, yeah, go ahead\u2026\nAaron Rakers\nKeep going, Keith.\nKeith White\nYeah, going forward, we're going to continue to develop more of these horizontal workloads. So you'll hear us talk about a variety of things around our sort of core compute, storage and networking, but manifesting those into workloads that customers care about.\nAnd we're also engaging now deeply with a number of the vertical vendors, if you will, you know, folks like Splunk, Epic, a few other folks to ensure that we're also providing these vertical workloads in this optimized format to our customer base.\nSo think about FinServ, Hub Stack, Defense is obviously big, Healthcare, Automotive and Manufacturing. And in fact, we're going to announce a few of these next week. So you'll hear more news on the 9th.\nAaron Rakers\nOkay, that's great. And let's talk a little bit about the business, right. I mean, you've touched on $585 million of ARR. I think last night, we talked about 20% order growth, I think the prior quarter was 82%. So you've seen some good, solid, double-digit growth there. And the companies continue to emphasize and reiterate that you see this business growing at a 30% to 40% CAGR over the next couple of years.\nSo in that context, underpinning all of that, I'd love to understand if you could help us appreciate some of the customer metrics, like when you're engaged with a large enterprise customer, what percentage of these customers today are really deciding to look and engage on that as a service type model? But let's start there.\nKeith White\nYeah. No, I think it's great. So in essence, as I mentioned, the value prop for GreenLake is really resonating with customers, right. The world is hybrid, it's multi cloud. And interestingly enough, what's really happening is they're looking for a partner in this modernization, digital transformation type scenario, right. So it's really getting away from being just a vendor, and a provider of technology to really being their partner.\nAnd then with COVID hitting, you're now seeing customers looking for a much more cost effective spending scenario, right. OpEx versus CapEx, not having to write big checks up front, maintaining that free cash flow that we know is so important.\nSo you see the metrics that we look at, for example, the number of customers. So in FY \u201817, when this all started, before I got here, we had about 350 or so customers. Today, we're at over 1000 customers worldwide. And this is in 50 countries, a number of the Fortune 500, as well as a variety of the industry, some of that I talked about, and others as well. And that total contract value has more than tripled to over $4 billion of where we're at today.\nAs you know, there is a lot of new customers that we're getting. A great example is you all at Wells Fargo we announced the work we're doing with you, and Splunk, at our Security Analyst meeting in October. We're basically taking and creating a unified data repository that all the groups inside of Wells can use, because there's a ton of machine and telemetry data that Splunk captures every day that folks need to leverage to do their jobs more effectively. And we're seeing that consistently around.\nWe also announced LyondellBasell, they are a large chemical manufacturing organization. They wanted to get out of the data center business, but they didn't want to move things to the public cloud, they still wanted control. So they wanted to modernize and migrate their data center to a co-lo.\nAnd so they've done that with GreenLake. It's a scenario where we managed that fully for them. We help them with the migration itself. And they get the benefit of no longer having to manage that, no longer having to worry about you know, how much power comes to this or coolant [ph] that or space real estate this, they get all that taken care of for them. And as well as the footprint, from a sustainability standpoint gets addressed as well.\nSo these new customers are really critical for us to exceed the continued growth that we have. And so they're coming to us and saying, hey, we're looking for a solution, we're looking for consumption based, but we want to keep it on-prem. And so that's really key.\nAt the same time, there's this whole growth, the motion is sort of, I would say land and expand because what happens is once a customer gets on GreenLake, we're seeing a vast majority of our pipeline be from existing customers as well. So they're taking in, they're growing their usage, plus, they're also adding on the next project and the next project.\nAnd so you look at someone like Nokia, they're now using GreenLake for their entire DevOps operations for when they build new applications. Our friends at Danfoss were using GreenLake for their SAP implementation. They've now gone to a private cloud on a worldwide basis using GreenLake as well.\nAnd then you're seeing government agencies like Kern County. They started to use GreenLake as a way to get their arms around their data state to get everything in a central place, similar to what we talked about with Wells. But now they've standardized on GreenLake across their 40 different departments to have a standard approach to IT, again, to simplify and free that up. So, huge opportunity ahead from that standpoint.\nAaron Rakers\nSo it kind of brings me to a question that just kind of popped in my head is that, you know, we all know that HPE has the infrastructure, right? You've got not just you know, traditional compute x86, you've done this last night's results on HPC and MCS side was very strong storage, et cetera.\nBut that ability to have that abstraction, that metering capability, because I guess where I struggle a little bit is that there's a lot of companies that talk about as a service today. So can you talk a little bit about what makes HPE capabilities just architecturally competitively different?\nKeith White\nNo, I think you nailed it. And in essence, when you think about sort of what other companies are doing, in essence, there's sort of six key areas that I think we really differentiate ourselves from.\nSo first off, you mentioned this up-front, but this edge to cloud portfolio that we provide, really delivering truly optimized systems. So because we have the edge components, such as Aruba, all the way up to the largest computers, with Cray, as the acquisitions that we've made, and everything in between, with compute, storage, and networking, we really can take from the best of the best.\nAnd so in essence, you have that piece of it. Combine that with our software portfolio, the work we've done around AI and Analytics, the HPE Ezmeral software portfolio that you've probably heard about, it really puts us sort of years ahead of the competition, and it really creates this true consumption based scenario.\nThe other thing, as I mentioned up-front is, we're really delivering cloud services on-prem. So not just the usage capability that I think a lot of our competitors are doing, but true cloud services that are automated and self-serve. And I have mentioned, you know, virtual machines and containers, and ML Ops and a variety of other workloads.\nAnd this really basically allows customers to bring solutions to market about 75% faster than they would in these traditional CapEx. And you nailed one of the key differentiators that we have is, we do true pay per use on-prem charging for our customers, right. So in essence, they only pay for what components of the system that they actually use.\nSo we do true metered usage. And our competitors are really just doing a leasing program that's disguised as a consumption scenario. But again, this is where we're seeing folks free up capital, from expensive over provisioning. And this is averaging in the 30% to 40% range from a saving standpoint. And then key with the public cloud is we don't have a data egress charge. So anytime you put data up in the cloud, to pull it back down, you get charged for that. And this can turn into millions of dollars of cost just to get your data out. And so significant savings on that front end.\nAaron Rakers\nSo are you able to go into an existing HPE customer and engage on this front, even with their existing footprint of infrastructure and take over that that data center environment and layer it or enable them to just move this, you know, move over to this GreenLake offering strategy?\nKeith White\nYeah, that's a great question, because as customers want to see this, so we have a few options for those types of customers. So we do something called buyback. And we'll do this not just for HP equipment, but we'll do it also for non-HP equipment. And this is done through our HPE Financial Services. You know, they're one of the industry leading, asset light - asset lifecycle management, and drivers of this consumption based business. And so we'll actually do buybacks and then update the customer with the full GreenLake scenario, if that's what they'd like to do. So we can absolutely do that.\nWhat's happening with these customers is they're basically making decisions on every workload, and every solution. And as I mentioned, hybrid, multi cloud world, means that they're always looking for the best implementation of that. And so sometimes a CapEx scenario might be most beneficial for them from an accounting or financial standpoint, sometimes the public cloud might be the best for that specific workload. But as I mentioned, we're seeing about 70% of apps and data really stay on-prem. And these workloads are ones that then GreenLake becomes very compelling to them from that standpoint.\nAaron Rakers\nI want to go back to the competitive differentiation a little bit, because I feel and again, you can kind of add context or just tell me if I'm wrong, if I'm wrong. But the metering capability right, versus a lease model is that - help me understand the components of that, is that - how is that competitively different? Is that something that HPE built itself, is that\u2026\nKeith White\nYeah\u2026\nAaron Rakers\nOr something just because - because to me that is truly an important competitive piece of the equation?\nKeith White\nNo, great point. And I probably should have articulated that. So yeah, we did acquire a company called Cloud Cruiser about 3 years ago. And they're the ones that we get all of our metering capabilities from. And so what we do is we're tracking on the system, how many gigabytes of storage you're using, how many of the cores or the CPUs are you using. And again, we would have something that has a lot of capacity. And if the customer is only using a portion of that that's what we were charged them for. And so we charge a, you know, a cost for that unit, if you will, for what the customer uses.\nSo it really means that, hey, instead of me buying a system that's way over provisioned for what I need, or is much more horsepower than I maybe won't ever use, I get that that true benefit. And so you're right. Most of the other - our competitors don't have this type of technology or capability. It's really unique to us through that acquisition. And we've really sort of continued to build on that to provide a lot of insights for customers.\nSo we'll actually even take that data and we put it into our cost analytics environment. So we can see, hey, how much am I spending on GreenLake, in what scenario? Where am I spending it and in which location, but we've also extended that out to Azure and AWS.\nAnd so as a CFO, I can look at my spend across public and GreenLake cloud spend. And then we provide a set of analytics machine learning models to do cost benefit analysis to say, hey, where's the most effective place for you to run this? Where can you save dollars? And so we have a lot of value add on top of it, as well. But yeah, that Cloud Cruiser Technology, the fact that we meter things down to each individual component, and that's what we charge customers for. And we can also do the - understanding of what's being spent where, as well as the cost analytics to provide them with cost savings is significant.\nAaron Rakers\nYeah. And the importance of HPFS wrapped around that is really a key component as well.\nKeith White\nYeah.\nAaron Rakers\nSo, kind of same question as Ezmeral. Talk a little bit about what that is, how that fits into the GreenLake strategy, why that's important?\nKeith White\nNo, it's a really good question, because, in essence, we have made a couple other acquisitions. So I'll start there, so that you can - we can flow into that. We purchased MapR, which is a world-leading file system, and BlueData, super deep on data and analytics. And based on those technologies, we came out with our HPE Ezmeral Container Platform.\nSo this is a full what we call CNCF-certified, using 100% open source Kubernetes. It's optimized for multi-tenant, multi-cluster management. And it's suitable for cloud-native apps, non-cloud-native apps, legacy applications. And we can run it not just in GreenLake, but on other HPE hardware, in the public clouds, as well as on non-HPE hardware. So it really provides that capability.\nAnd as part of that, we made an acquisition called Cray [ph] as well. And we've taken that cluster management capability to again enable administrators to easily create these clusters, add policies and permissions and allocate clusters to groups for developers or analytics, if you will.\nSo this Ezmeral Container Platform is really sort of geared towards these high-end, data capabilities, and the opportunity to containerize these applications and simplify that over time. And that's becoming a much more key piece of our all up GreenLake solution offering. I had mentioned the internal software that we're using, that's a core component for our ML Ops, for our container as a service offering that I talked about, as well. So yeah, we're really excited about the great work that's happening there. And Kumar Sreekanti and his software team are doing fantastic work.\nAaron Rakers\nThat's, a great overview, and not to go back to the finance. Well, to go back to the financials. I think it was in the July quarter with 82% order growth in GreenLake. It was also noted that North America was growing, I think it was 5x, year-over-year. So that is a big number on a growth basis.\nCan you talk about the geographical expansion that you've seen? Is this still predominantly North America? Is it - any kind of metrics you can get around a geographical expansion would be great\u2026\nKeith White\nYeah. You bet. You bet. No, I think it's a great question, because, yeah, we did see significant growth in North America. And frankly, as with most businesses, this was similar at Microsoft. There's a large percent of the business that does it in North America.\nThat said, I was pleasantly surprised to see significant growth in other areas as well, I think I mentioned up front that we have over 1000 customers, we're in 50 different countries worldwide. And, we saw a fantastic growth in EMEA, as well as in Japan, and our APAC region.\nAnd so the nice thing is, is we're seeing a nice balance of it. So if you think about a country like Japan, they don't have a lot of internal IT scenarios. And so - and they don't, aren't doing a lot with the public cloud. And so for them on-prem, managed for you, and then the benefit of being able to pay for it for a consumption basis is super compelling.\nAnd then, as I mentioned, APAC in areas like Australia, and Korea, and then in Europe, we're seeing really strong growth in the northwest Europe scenario, as well as in our Germany and UK regions as well. So - and frankly, it's moving down into EMEA also.\nSo I'd say this, geographically, we're getting fantastic traction across the board. And, again, it goes back to where we're seeing a need, where people have the security requirements, the data sovereignty requirements, the regulatory type scenarios, and again, when it's 70 plus percent, there's opportunity worldwide. And that's why we see this. I think we mentioned it at SAM the $22 billion market opportunity in FY \u201823.\nAaron Rakers\nYeah, and that's perfect. And on that same kind of topic, or customer engagement. I know it's probably hard to answer this, because HP is a very broad, diverse company from a customer standpoint. But how have you seen GreenLake resolved itself in engagements with new customers or new opportunities?\nKeith White\nIt's been a fantastic door opener for us. And, in essence, to your point, we have a lot of fantastic relationships. And I think one of the benefits when I came into HPE, that I saw was, wow, you know, very strong enterprise name, our Pointnext Services, world class in providing, support, advisory and professional services and all that capability. As you mentioned, HPE Financial Service really helping customers in that front, and then, you know, strong solid market share across the different products.\nBut what we're seeing is, as customers are going through this digital transformation, they're also looking for new business models. So when you think about something like GreenLake to be able to charge as a service, we're seeing a lot of managed service providers being very interested in what we're doing. And we're seeing sort of new ideas.\nSo I've mentioned at SAM a little bit about what we're doing with ABB, one of the top manufacturing companies in the world, where we've been partnering with them on their factory of the future. And so in essence, they're promoting scenarios like robotics as a service, where because the precision of a robotics arm is so critical on that manufacturing floor, everything has to be done locally, right, you have to do the computing, the analytics, the precision of getting that manufacturing component just right.\nAnd they're providing that now as a service to their customer base. So in essence, they're selling GreenLake through into what they're providing to their customers. And so we're seeing a lot of new growth with a lot of these partnerships like the SAP scenario.\nAccenture runs their Accenture hybrid cloud all in GreenLake. And, and so it's interesting, we're getting that through the pull of these solutions from our partner base. But at the same time, as people have sort of played with the public cloud, they're seeing opportunities to again, have that hybrid scenario and they want that similar experience. And so that's why I say GreenLake certainly [ph] to open up that new set of opportunities for us.\nAaron Rakers\nThat's perfect. I think Keith, we're right up against our time window. I really approved as quick 30 minutes. I appreciate you spending time with us and walking us through what seems to be a very good ramp in the GreenLake strategy.\nKeith White\nAnd thank you so much for having me. Anytime really appreciate the opportunity and happy to join anytime if there's an opportunity again. Thanks.\nAaron Rakers\nOkay. Thanks, Keith. Bye.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nEnd of Q&A\n\n",

HP delivered another strong earnings quarter, reflecting the strength of our innovation and execution, the progress we\u2019re making against our strategic priorities and the multiple value creation engines across our company.\nIn Q4, we grew revenue 2% in constant currency. We grew non-GAAP operating profit dollars 5%, and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.60, an increase of 11% and above our guided range. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter, where we have grown revenue, non-GAAP op dollars and non-GAAP EPS.\nThe fourth quarter capped off a very solid year in which we exceeded our targets for non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. Our strategy is working and we are confident about our business outlook heading into fiscal year 2020.\nFor the full fiscal year 2019, we grew revenue 2% in constant currency, our third consecutive year of growth. We grew non-GAAP EPS 11%, with double-digit increases for the last two years. We generated $4 billion in free cash flow above our full-year outlook and we returned 85% of that to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nWe continue to lead in our core market with strong disciplined execution, finishing the year shipping roughly one in every four PC units and two out of every five printing. These results demonstrate that we have multiple levers to drive operating profit dollars and create shareholder value. And I want to be very clear, our focus remains on creating value for all of our shareholders and delivering for our customers, partners and employees.\nI have great confidence in the strategies that we shared at our Securities Analyst Meeting. It is confirmed by the progress we have already started to make in the five key strategic moves I laid out.\nLet me recap each of them and share initial examples of the progress we are making. The first move is implementing a new operating model and driving digital transformation. On November 1, we went live with our new operating model and the creation of a single commercial organization to simplify our go-to-market structure. We have taken out the regional layer of the organization. This helps us to reduce costs, accelerate decision-making and be closer to customers. We have also introduced a new business management system to streamline accountability.\nSecond, we are delivering new compute experiences. HP is delivering the best innovation in the market. Recently, we launched our latest commercial notebook, the Elite Dragonfly. With an ultra-bright screen and HP Sure View privacy, this device is purpose-built for the modern workforce, which demands flexibility to work anywhere. It is also the world\u2019s first laptop made using ocean-bound plastic, reflecting our continued commitment to environmental sustainability. It\u2019s another example of how we continue to set new standards in the PC category.\nIn addition, we continue to strengthen our commitment to security with acquisition of Bromium, an innovator in endpoint security. Our belief is that every device decision is a security decision. With Bromium, we will be able to provide comprehensive protection against the most sophisticated malware and enhance our firmware and BIOS security players.\nThird, we are evolving trained business model. Our contractual business continued to grow with NPS and Instant Ink is up double-digit. And with over 5 million subscribers, their momentum in Instant Ink continues to build. At the same time, our big ink and big toner products extended their roll out launching in Latin America and Central Europe.\nImportantly, the new transactional business model we introduced at SAM with Office customers either flexible or a full into an HP system is on track to launch new products by the end of fiscal year 2020, and remember, this model will evolve over time.\nFourth, we are expanding our industrial businesses. In graphics, we see steady growth in pages printed. In fiscal year 2019, in 3D and digital manufacturing, we more than doubled the number of parts produced with over 18 million final production parts across a widening range of applications.\nWe remain on track to double the number of parts by the end of fiscal year 2020. And we just help Volkswagen produce 10,000 precision metal parts in just a few weeks to support the launch of their ID.3 electric vehicle.\nAnd finally, we are executing on our restructuring. We have initiated a voluntary early retirement program in the United States, and the take rate increases my confidence in our ability to deliver on our savings goals.\nLet me know make a few comments on our business segment performance. In Q4, personal systems delivered another strong performance of revenue, operating profit and share growth. Revenue grew 5% in constant currency and operating profit increased 48%. These results reinforce the strength of our innovation and disciplined execution against our strategy.\nWe continued to outperform the PC market with broad-based growth across all regions and product category. In calendar Q3, we grew faster than our competitors gaining 1.2 points of shares. While we are proud of these results, share gain continues to be an outcome, not an objective.\nWe are delivering these results, despite the ongoing industry constraints on CPU capacity, which are now expected to continue into the first-half of 2020 and to be more impactful in Q1.\nTurning to print. We continue to execute our strategy. In Q4, total revenue declined 5% in constant currency. As we had anticipated, supplies revenue remained soft. We\u2019re executing against both the operational and strategic plans we laid out in prior quarters. And as we said into fiscal year 2020, we expect our new commercial organization will drive better global best practices and consistency in supplies execution.\nIn fact, elements of the design and implementation of the new commercial organization are extremely focused on addressing some of the operational issues and leadership changes in EMEA.\nAs always, maximizing the value of our installed base is our core objective. We are driving preference for HP original supplies with targeted marketing campaigns that ensures that customers understand the quality, sustainability and security benefit of HP original supplies compared to the alternative. We expect the combination of these actions to show improvement as we get further into fiscal year 2020, and we remain focused on maximizing the value of our installed base.\nIn graphics, we recently closed another key win with ePac Flexible Packaging for an additional 24 HP Indigo digital presses, as they continue the disruption of a global flexible packaging market.\nLooking at CD and digital manufacturing, we finished the year strong. Our business continues to grow and the market acceptance of our new industrial 5200 solution has been positive. We are expanding our alliance ecosystem and building in production applications across key verticals, including automotive, industrial, consumer and healthcare.\nI\u2019m pleased with our progress and look forward to delivering even more disruptive solutions in fiscal year 2020.\nIn closing, we delivered another good quarter, demonstrating our track record of execution. These results and the progress we are making give me confidence in our strategy and the upside opportunities HP has for even greater value creation.\nOur plans to advance, revamp and transform provide us with three powerful engine of value creation and support a clear and compelling investment thesis. We believe that a powerful combination of our scale generate an incredible brand, combined with our track record of execution and innovation, will create significant value for our customers and our shareholders.\nNow, before I turn the call over to Steve, let me note that we will not be expanding on our previous public comments with regards to Xerox proposal. Accordingly, we ask that you please keep your questions focused on the business and our results during the Q&A portion of this call, as we will not be commenting on Xerox or its proposal.\nNow, I will turn it over to Steve to go through more details and provide our financial outlook.\nSteve Fieler\nThanks, Enrique. Q4 was a solid finish to FY 2019, where we once again demonstrated our ability to consistently deliver company results, posting growth in revenue, non-GAAP operating profit and EPS.\nBefore diving further into Q4, let me quickly recap FY 2019 for the full-year. We grew revenue, we grew non-GAAP operating profit dollars faster than revenue, and we grew non-GAAP EPS even faster. These results show the strength of our financial model.\nFor the full-year, constant currency revenue was up 2%. Non-GAAP operating profit dollars grew 3%, with operating margin rate expansion in both print and personal systems. Print grew margins by 10 basis points to 16%, while PS grew 120 basis points to 4.9%, both within our guided ranges.\nWe delivered non-GAAP EPS of $2.24, an increase of 11% and above our guided range. We generated $4 billion of free cash flow, ahead of our full-year outlook of at least $3.7 billion, and we returned $3.4 billion, or 85% of free cash flow to shareholders. Importantly, we delivered these results, while investing in our business for future growth and efficiency opportunities.\nOur foundation is strong, including our balance sheets, and we have multiple levers to create value for our shareholders. This is what we said at our Security Analyst Meeting and this is what we intend to do. Overall, we are pleased with our full-year results, despite more challenging industry, macro economic and geopolitical dynamics.\nNow let\u2019s look at the details of the fourth quarter. Net revenue was $15.4 billion flat year-on-year, or up 2% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, APJ grew 7%, Americas grew 1% and EMEA was flat. Gross margin was 19%, up 1.4 percentage points a year-on-year, driven primarily by disciplined execution and improved rate in personal systems, as well as improved rate in print, supported by higher hardware gross margins.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion, up a 11%, driven by increased investments for both growth and efficiency, including investments to drive future revenue and innovation, as well as investments in HP\u2019s digital transformation.\nNon-GAAP net OI&E expense was $60 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.60, up $0.06, or 11%, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.5 billion shares.\nNon-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes amortization of intangible assets of $21 million, acquisition-related charges of $21 million, restructuring and other charges of $105 million, as well as non-operating retirement-related credits of $14 million. It also excludes the net expense of $378 million for tax adjustments. This net expense is primarily driven by the termination of our Tax Matters Agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, partially offset by other tax adjustments.\nAs a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.26. At the segment level and personal systems, we are again very pleased with our results. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $10.4 billion, up 4%, or 5% in constant currency. By customer segment, commercial revenue was up 8% and consumer revenue was down 4%. By product category, revenue was up 12% for workstations, up 5% for desktops and up 2% for notebooks.\nThe team continue to successfully manage our overall product mix, as commercial demand remains strong, while navigating a softer consumer market. Personal systems has been consistently delivering profitable growth and share gains over time. HP outgrew the market in calendar quarter three with strong execution, HP specific innovation and a focus on exceptional partner and end customer experiences.\nIn addition, we see opportunities to improve our portfolio mix over time in areas of premium, displays and accessories, and services. For example, this quarter, our revenue in retail solutions business and gaming, along with our services orders, all grew double digits.\nQ4 operating margins remained exceptionally strong at 5.3%, up 1.6 points year-on-year. The large increase was driven mainly by the team\u2019s continued execution of our strategy, balancing the industry\u2019s various puts and takes and remaining disciplined in a favorable commodity cost environment. Operating profit was $556 million, up 48% from the prior year.\nIn print, the business performed generally in line with our expectations for the quarter. We continue to deliver leading customer experiences, big progress in our contractual offerings, incrementally shift more profit to hardware and address our near-term operational challenges in EMEA.\nLooking at the details. Q4 total print revenue was $5 billion, down 6% nominally and 5% in constant currency. Our operating margins were down 0.4 points to 15.6% due to lower supplies revenue.\nCommercial hardware revenue was down 2% and consumer hardware revenue was down 10%. Total hardware units were down 9%, driven by declines in consumer units, which were down 10%, with commercial units down 1%.\nFourth quarter supplies revenue was $3.2 billion, down 7% in constant currency, again, driven by declines in EMEA. We are making progress on our operational improvement plans and we\u2019ve seen a significant reduction in Tier 1 and monitored Tier 2 channel inventory dollars in EMEA throughout the year. Overall, Tier 1 channel inventory levels remain the low the reduced ceilings.\nWe continue to make progress on our strategic plans to evolve our business models. We\u2019re seeing success in contractual, as we grew both managed print service and Instant Ink this quarter. Importantly, we remain under indexed in contractual and are pleased that we continue to outgrow the market.\nLet me now turn to our transformation efforts, and specifically our cost savings opportunities. At SAM, we described our plans to generate approximately $1 billion of gross run rate savings by the end of FY 2022, and that we continue looking for more opportunities.\nIn Q4, we announced a voluntary early retirement programs in the United States within 1,000 participants have opted into the plan, which will be effective through the course of the year. This take rate adds to our confidence in delivering both the FY 2020 and overall plan savings targets.\nTurning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $588 million and $392 million, respectively. We generated $4 billion in free cash flow for the full-year. In Q4, the cash conversion cycle was minus 31 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle declined five days, in line with normal seasonality with a six-day decrease in days payable outstanding. a two-day increase in day sales outstanding and a three-day decrease in days of inventory.\nWe\u2019ve returned $461 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $236 million via cash dividends in Q4. For the full-year, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and $1 billion via cash dividends.\nLooking forward to Q1 and FY 2020, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We expect that the macroeconomic conditions will remain dynamic as they are today and we expect our end markets to remain competitive. We\u2019re expecting currency to have about a 1% year-over-year negative impact.\nSpecific to personal systems, we expect commodities to be significantly less of a tailwind in FY 2020 and in FY 2019, especially in the second-half. We now expect industry-wide CPU supply constraints to persist through the first-half of 2020.\nIn Q1 specifically, we\u2019re anticipating a larger revenue impact than in Q4. However, we expect our mix to shift to more profitable units, which should largely mitigate the profit impact.\nIn printing, we\u2019re assuming a year-over-year unit market decline, driven by the home market. As a reminder, we are deliberately not chasing share, especially as we raise hardware pricing and focus on profitable growth.\nAs described at SAM, as we progress through the year, we expect the net benefits of our transformation cost savings and other operational changes to begin to materialize. In addition, for the full-year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projections to be 16% in FY 2020.\nConsistent to what we communicated in October, we expect to return at least 75% of free cash flow to shareholders in FY 2020, as we view our shares as significantly undervalued.\nTaking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. Q1 2020 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.56. Q1 2020 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.42. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2020 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.32, and full-year fiscal 2020 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.10.\nOperator, we can now open the call for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani\nThanks, guys. I have a, I guess, question and a follow-up. The first one, I guess on supplies, Enrique. I don\u2019t want to use the word stabilize, but we\u2019ve been down 7%, I think, for a couple of quarters in a row now. Do you think we\u2019re starting to hit a bottom over here? And how should we think about the supplies trajectory as we go through fiscal 2020? And any feedback you\u2019ve had from your customers or suppliers, I guess, broadly in terms of the business model transition and the preference they have over here?\nEnrique Lores\nSo let me give \u2013 first, let me help to frame the problem that we are facing in supplies and then we will provide some more data about what we see happening in the future. As we have shared in the past, we\u2019ve had two challenges on the supply side.\nFirst, we have what we call a strategic challenge, driven by the growth of clones because of the lower pricing and the access that they have to the online space. But we also have an operational challenge in EMEA, driven by the low visibility we had of some inventory in their monitor \u2013 monitored channel, combined with the aggressiveness of the clone competition. And we\u2019re making good progress addressing both problems.\nOn the strategy side, we announced our plans in the Security Analyst Meeting to transform our model by evolving into services, accelerating the growth in big ink and big toner in emerging countries, and at the end of next year, starting to evolve our transactional model into both an end-to-end for our flexible model.\nOn the operational side, we have also made good progress, reducing our inventory, accelerating our growth online, getting better visibility of the inventory in Tier twos, and as we said in the prepared remarks, changing our control processes to make sure that we have better business management processes in EMEA. Steve?\nSteve Fieler\nYes, sure. I mean, I think to start, as I\u2019ve said many times, our focus remains on operating profit dollars across the entire print ecosystem, but it\u2019s really specifically to supplies. Enrique, you mentioned operationally making good progress. We\u2019re seeing good indicators. Strategically, we\u2019re taking the right long-term steps.\nQ1, specifically, I guess, what I\u2019d say is, we\u2019re planning prudently. Therefore, we\u2019re planning Q1 to kind of be more in the range of where we were in Q4. And that\u2019s embedded in our outlook and have confidence in the plan. Through the remainder of 2020 and there\u2019s things that we view as tailwinds, we\u2019re shifting more of our business contractual-based models and that\u2019s across both home and office. And so that\u2019s stickier higher share revenue for us.\nWe expect to continue to grow our industrial businesses across graphics and 3D. And as Enrique mentioned, we\u2019re making the right operational changes in EMEA, but also globally within new commercial organization. Obviously, we have some offsets. As you\u2019re aware, we have declines in the installed-base in home. We\u2019re very well aware of that, and, obviously need to mitigate those declines. And also the challenges we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters on the after-market share of supplies. So we got some pluses and minuses we had through the rest of the year. I guess, kind of \u2013 that\u2019s how we\u2019ve used supplies trajectory for FY 2020.\nAmit Daryanani\nGot it. That\u2019s really helpful. And I guess, my follow-up, Steve, for you. $4 billion free cash flow this year extremely impressive, I think, was better than what you guys were targeting. Can you just maybe bridge this for me and everyone \u2013 $4 billion in fiscal 2019 to $3 billion in fiscal 2020, kind of what are the puts and takes? And I\u2019m assuming \u2013 and really to understand how much of the delta over here is transitory in nature versus structural, that\u2019ll be helpful?\nEnrique Lores\nSure. So I\u2019ve got a lot of confidence delivering at least $3 billion, and that\u2019s our outlook for FY 2020. If you just look back over the past four years, we\u2019ve averaged a little bit over $3.5 billion each year. And this year, in particular, we do have a headwind primarily as it relates to restructuring of roughly $400 million. As I mentioned, SAM, there\u2019s some other one-time favorability, as we saw in FY 2019 that we don\u2019t expect to repeat.\nThat being said, given where we ended cash conversion cycle in FYI 2019, I would view CCC is actually a help year-over-year. Our outlook for FY 2020 is minus 33 days and we finished FY 2019, it\u2019s minus 31. We\u2019ll need to see how the PS volume plays out in the second-half. And I would note that the seasonality this year in PS maybe different, given some of the industry dynamics. But altogether, get a high degree of confidence in delivering the at least $3 billion on it.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. I know you talked, you said you won\u2019t talk about Xerox, so I won\u2019t ask that specifically. But in the conversations you\u2019ve had back and forth in the letters. couple of times, there has been a mention of strong balance sheet and share repurchase. So I guess, maybe can you take a minute to just talk about how you view your capital structure, uses of cash and I don\u2019t know your thoughts on sort of where investors are leaning or where the Board is \u2013 what the Board is thinking these days. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nSteve Fieler\nAnd maybe just for starters, I do want to repeat maybe some of my comments at SAM and then talk about where we are. As you\u2019re aware, we did update our long-term return of capital targets are screened and spending to return approximately 75%. That\u2019s our long-term target. And really, this is about a steady return profile for investors and supporting our business strategy.\nFor FY 2020, specifically, we\u2019re targeting at least 75% return and that was, you said the time, given our stock price significantly undervalued the business and we have confidence in our outlook. We also indicated that our Board approved an incremental 5 billion share repurchase authorization.\nSo we do have the flexibility to be opportunistic. Kind of bring it back up to, I guess, the point \u2013 question on capital allocation, which we do view is a extremely critical management responsibility. In our framework, we\u2019ll remain disciplined. We have evaluated. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate ways with our balance sheet to create additional shareholder value. That could include M&A, it could include additional return of capital. As always, we\u2019ll compare the options using return, risk adjusted view of each opportunity.\nShannon Cross\nOkay.\nEnrique Lores\nAnd, Shannon, let me emphasize the confidence we have in our plans. We explain our strategy during the Security Analysis Meeting. We\u2019re making progress, but we\u2019re very confident in our ability to create value for shareholders, which is our key priority.\nShannon Cross\nThanks. And then maybe you can talk a bit about the A3 market? What you\u2019re seeing there competition, and how some of your initiatives are going? Thank you.\nEnrique Lores\nSo A3 is our key element of our contractual plan. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we are making very good progress. In a flat market, we are growing double-digit. And if we focus for a second on A3, we have grown 5%, where the market is very flat. So very good progress.\nAnd I think this is really important, because as we look at the future of the print business and the need to change the opportunity we have to continue to expand and change the business model, growing and contractual is critical for us going forward. And this is really where our focus is, and where really our focus will continue to be in the incoming quarters.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi\nYes. Thank you. I have a question and a follow-up as well. I was wondering if you could comment specifically on channel inventory over the course of this year. So specifically, if I were to look at this day a year ago versus today, how significant was your drawdown in channel inventory in terms of weeks? And what impact did that have on supplies revenue growth this quarter \u2013 this year, excuse me, in fiscal 2019? And do you believe that supplies revenue growth will be better in fiscal 2020 than 2019? And I\u2019ll do my follow-up after.\nSteve Fieler\nSo I\u2019m assuming this is about the supplies channel inventory and not channel inventory broadly. So let me kind of comment on where the supply channel inventory went this year.\nSo throughout FY 2019, we have reduced our channel inventory dollars by over $100 million. This is more than what we initially estimated. So we continue to make good progress. This includes, both Tier 1 and parts of Trier 2 and note that we don\u2019t have complete visibility into our ecosystem. And so things are getting better. We do know at the same time, the EMEA market has softened.\nSo it\u2019s hard to bifurcate or specifically quantify how much of that channel inventory reduction was a result of starting the year off in high position versus what was happening in the market \u2013 marketplace. But you should sort of think about it is at least $100 million channel inventory reduction on a year-over-year basis.\nAs I mentioned, as it relates to FY 2020, we do feel like there\u2019s things that are going our way from the contractual models, industrial businesses and the operational changes we\u2019ve made, but we also have headwinds. And so we have to manage the headwinds around the home side, have to manage the headwinds around ensuring we\u2019re protecting our share as much as possible.\nSo I think those are all factored into how we\u2019re thinking about FY 2020. We\u2019re taking a very prudent view in that prudent view and that prudent view is factored into not just our Q1, but overall FY 2020 outlook.\nToni Sacconaghi\nOkay. So no explicit comments on whether up or down relative to fiscal 2019 in terms of what\u2019s baked into your guidance, Steve?\nSteve Fieler\nAs I said, I think, we\u2019ve got some headwinds and tailwinds. What we\u2019re driving is operating profit dollars in our print business. Obviously supplies is a big part of it, but so is the shift more to hardware. We saw our hardware gross margins expand in Q4 as an example and adding more services to the portfolio. So all together is what we\u2019re driving to focus on op dollars versus just supply, specifically.\nToni Sacconaghi\nAnd then just a follow-up, you\u2019ve stated repeatedly on the call that you believe your shares are undervalued and that you outlined a highly credible strategy at SAM. But prior to the Xerox announcement, the stock is traded at $17 or less since the Securities Analyst Meeting.\nAnd so I guess, my question to you is, what is it that you think you see that investors are missing, given where the stock is traded at following SAM? And if you really were so confident that the stock has been structurally undervalued throughout the year, why did your SAM plan not include your deciding to take on debt and much more aggressively repurchase your shares?\nEnrique Lores\nLet me start and then, I think, Steve will complement. I think the key thing that we see, Toni, is gap between the current value of the stock or the net present value for the cash flow projections that we have in our plan. And this is what will drive our comment and think about being undervalued.\nWhat we have proven this quarter and we have proven in the past is that, we have clear ability to execute and that we deliver on our commitment. And our expectation is that by executing every quarter and meeting our guidelines, we will be seeing that gap to be reduced.\nSteve Fieler\nAnd maybe just to add to that. What we did say at SAM, we did have a change in terms of our fiscal year 2020 return of capital, where we communicated that we expect to return at least 75% and also announced an incremental authorization of share repurchase from the Board of $5 billion to give us the flexibility and opportunity to repurchase more shares. To note, in Q4, we did have additional material non-public information, I think, that\u2019s obvious now. And so we were not as active in the market as we would like to have been.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKaty Huberty\nThank you. Good afternoon. How are you thinking about first quarter 2020 revenue performance versus normal seasonality, given the Intel comments about component constraints and your comments about not expecting an improvement in supplies rate of decline? And then I have a follow-up.\nSteve Fieler\nYes. So we are assuming that the CPU supply will constrain our revenue in Q1. And if you think about it on a sequential basis, certainly in the personal systems business, we would expect to have declines from Q4 to Q1 above the normal seasonal patterns. That being said, while this is more of a revenue impact than profit impact for the quarter as we expect our mixture should be better.\nKaty Huberty\nOkay. Then just thinking more broadly over the course of fiscal 2020, Steve, you had mentioned that you see the potential for different seasonality than in the past. How long are you expecting that the PC market strength associated with the Win 10 upgrade last? Does that continue well into the first-half of the year? And how do you see seasonality falling off in the back-half as customers complete those upgrades?\nEnrique Lores\nYes, Katy, I think the seasonality for next year is going to be impacted by the availability of CPUs. What we know now is that availability is going to be constrained for the first full half. And therefore, they will be having an impact on the seasonality we do the second and the first-half. So this is something that you really should have in mind, but you build a projection for next year.\nSteve Fieler\nAnd as it relates then to the Win 7, Win 10 refresh, it could be that these current supply constraints actually indeed help prolong the Win 10 refresh. And so there\u2019s a lot of dynamics going on. And that\u2019s why I think the seasonal patterns are likely to be affected, both from a supply, but also on the potential extension of the Win 10 refresh.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah\nHi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I have a question and a follow-up as well. Just sticking there, Steve, some of the distributors actually believe with regards to what\u2019s on the PC Win 10 refresh that there\u2019s actually a long way to go for a small and medium business customers, which is a meaningful part of your customer base, and not just chipset-related, but related to those folks tend to just kind of put off larger purchases as long as they possibly can. Do you have enough visibility to agree with that view or disagree with that view? And then I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.\nSteve Fieler\nI think, in general, we would agree with that view. I mean, there\u2019s a large installed base with the PCs more than four years old. And our assessment, we\u2019re a little over a third \u2013 about a third of which are still on Win 7. So there\u2019s an opportunity for upgrades. There\u2019s an opportunity for upgrades. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 and Alex described us at our Analyst Meeting that PCs are being used by this generation versus prior generations. And they\u2019re also using them for specific experiences.\nBut \u2013 so we see the TAM and our ability to gain share is a good opportunity not to mention our ability to continue improving our mix, but the short of it is, we still think that there\u2019s some life here on that Win 7, Win 10 refresh that will extend.\nEnrique Lores\nLet me reinforce his comments. I think the combination of our innovation and ability to execute have proven that have allowed us to grow faster than the market. And this is what we expect to continue to do going forward.\nAnanda Baruah\nThat \u2013 that\u2019s really helpful, guys. And just as a quick follow-up. You mentioned new \u2013 for printing, new models out by the end of fiscal, I think, you think you actually did 20. So could you clarify that\u2019s fiscal 2020 or calendar 2020 new models for the new printer model \u2013 new printer \u2013 a new harvest in the new printer model.\nCan you clarify that fiscal 2020 or calendar? And then just how does that fit in? I guess, the broader question is, how does that fit into you guys being able to really make an impact with the business model shift waiting for these new models? Thanks.\nEnrique Lores\nSo let me start from the second question and then I will go back to the details of the first. As we shared during SAM, the change of business model in print is driven by three different vectors. First, is a shift into services, both into managed print services and Instant Ink. These offers are better value proposition to customers. And this is a change that we have been driving for sometime in the past and where we are growing double-digit.\nSecond element of the change is the growth in emerging countries for the big ink on big toners category. Begging has been in the market for sometime. We are growing and we are the only company that offers a big tone of solution. And we have continued the roll out of this solution during the last month. And only the last part of the change easily driven by the new model for transactional customers. These new model, as you said, will be available in the market for the end of the year during our calendar Q4.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMatt Cabral\nThank you. Enrique, maybe to pickup on your last answer, you mentioned the initial roll out of big ink and big toner in other emerging markets. Just wondering if you talk about what the initial customer and competitive response has been so far? And just how you\u2019re thinking about the geographic roll out of that model more broadly across your portfolio?\nEnrique Lores\nSo the reception has been positive. As I said before, big ink has been in the market for sometime and we have been growing our share. Big toner is a category that we are creating and we started the launch a few months ago. And as we go into more countries, we continue to see the growth. Reception is very positive, because in those countries usually consumption is high. We have lower share of regional supply and therefore for us, it is a better model and it\u2019s also a better model for our customers.\nMatt Cabral\nThanks. And then, Steve, on personal systems margins are once again above 5% in the quarter. Just wondering if you could bridge how much of the year-over-year improvement was the tailwinds from component pricing versus just other underlying improvement. And just how we should think about that impact from component pricing as we move to fiscal 2020?\nSteve Fieler\nYes. It\u2019s fair to assume that some level of the profit margin rate and dollars did come from that. But it really is on the backs of how we execute our strategy and overall pricing discipline. There is a lot of puts and takes to pricing. Obviously, commodities have been favorable for us. Overall, a currency has been a headwind for us. And so as you take that all into consideration, in addition to the competitive dynamics, it\u2019s hard to specifically quantify how much of that sort of exceptional performance was due to the commodities.\nAs we sort of think about FY 2020 and sort of even from Q4 to Q1, we\u2019d expect the commodity costs to be a bit more stable. And therefore, I don\u2019t expect as much tailwind in Q1, and certainly as we enter into the second-half as we saw this year. That being said, we continue to have a more structural opportunity to improve our mix. And again, the team deserves a lot of credit for remaining disciplined in the overall pricing strategy.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers\nYes, thanks. Just kind of building on that last question, I have a follow-up as well. Thinking about setting component pricing to the side and thinking about the mix shift of the business, it does look like your ASP erosion on particularly your notebooks is kind of accelerated here a little bit.\nI\u2019m just kind of \u2013 wanted to understand of how I would think about the mix shift dynamic underneath of that. Any metrics you can share of how successful you\u2019ve been in terms of mix shifting within the PC portfolio and where you think that the biggest incremental levers are to continue to see that mix shift going forward as component pricing starts to stabilize and potentially whether or not we should think about ASPs on a blended basis moving higher going forward in PCs?\nSteve Fieler\nSo on a full-year basis, mix is definitely been a tailwind for us. In Q4 specifically, and as you point out in notebooks, but we did see an ASP decline, that\u2019s driven by FX, so that\u2019s a certain part of it. At the total print \u2013 EPS level is at 2 points and then rate was 2 points.\nWhen we look at the rate specifically, and I touched on this in my prior comments, but the overall industry-wide pricing adjustments in the market due to the commodity cost dynamics and certain product categories like notebooks, pricing is also dependent upon the supply availability that you get. And so all of that together is really what drove the ASP down year-over-year in Q4.\nIn terms of upside potential, I\u2019d say, we view as a significant over time. And when we think about mix, the good news for HP is we\u2019re under indexed in such favorable parts of the PC marketplace. We think about displays and accessories as you think about premium categories, and gaming which we grew double-digits this past quarter. You think about our services.\nAnd so all of that we view is more structural long-term tailwind for us. But in the near-term, yes, we\u2019re facing so many dynamics, Intel being another one as an example and the overall supply that we get. So \u2013 but when we think long-term, a lot of potential upside on our mix as we can continue to drive these growth initiatives.\nAaron Rakers\nYes. Okay, that\u2019s perfect. And then as a follow-up, kind of that Intel comment. The CPU shortage situation kind of persisted for much longer than what I think anybody would have expected. I\u2019m just curious of how you guys have kind of thought about mitigating that impact in the portfolio? There are seemingly more competitive alternatives out there in a CPU market today.\nI\u2019m just curious of how you see or what you think the explanation is for the CPU shortage and whether or not there\u2019s other ways to potentially bridge the impact of revenue here, would seemingly looks like it\u2019s going to persist here, as you say, through the first-half of 2020 at this point?\nEnrique Lores\nWell, you\u2019re right that we have been in this situation for about a year now. And as I said before, we expect it to continue for probably at least two other quarters. I think the question about the why is probably a better question to ask to Intel than to us.\nWhat I can tell you though is that, we continue to be committed to use multiple CPU providers. We are working with other vendors. We have been growing the mix of other categories. But Intel is still a very large part of our portfolio and therefore, there are shortages. We need to navigate through those and manage our business that way.\nSteve Fieler\nAnd just one other mitigation factor, I\u2019m kind of repeating my earlier comment, but it\u2019s important to reiterate, and that is, we do expect a better mix of units, which should help mitigate the profit impact of this, while there may be revenue, less so on the bottom line.\nEnrique Lores\nI think we are running out of time now. So I want to thank, everyone, for joining us today and taking the time to be here. And I\u2019d like to emphasize the confidence that we have in our strategy and the multiple levers that we have to create value.\nWe are \u2013 we have been and we will be relentless in managing costs and investing to create long-term value. And we know how to manage through the current dynamics, which is what \u2013 exactly what we have been doing during the last years. We will continue to execute our strategy with rigor and we will keep our focus to drive long-term create \u2013 the long-term value creation for our shareholders. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.\n\n",

I would like to welcome you to Adobe Systems Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nI would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMike Saviage\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe\u2019s President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen; and John Murphy, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nIn our call today, we will discuss Adobe\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2018 financial results. By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release, which crossed the wire approximately one hour ago. We\u2019ve also posted PDFs of our earnings call prepared remarks and slides, financial targets and an updated investor datasheet on adobe.com.

A reconciliation between the two is available in our earnings release and in our updated investor datasheet on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website. Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being webcast live in Adobe Connect, and is also being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be made available on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website for approximately 45 days, and is the property of Adobe. The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded, or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe.\nI will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\nShantanu Narayen\nThanks, Mike and good afternoon.\nAdobe delivered record revenue in our second quarter with strong financial results. Q2 revenue was $2.20 billion dollars, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.33, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.66.\nAdobe enables individuals, companies, governments and educational institutions to design and deliver transformative digital experiences, immersive, intelligent experiences that inspire, entertain, and drive loyalty and growth. The breadth of our product portfolio, the deep science embedded in our Adobe Cloud platform, the insights derived from the trillions of data transactions we process every year on behalf of our customers, and our global ecosystem of partners and developers have made Adobe the leader in enabling great customer experiences.\nIn our Digital Media business, we achieved strong growth in both Creative and Document Cloud revenue in Q2. We added net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR of $343 million, which grew total Digital Media ARR exiting Q2 to $6.06 billion.\nWe continue to drive steady adoption of Creative Cloud subscriptions and services by individuals, teams and enterprises across all segments and geographies. This resulted in another strong quarter for Creative Cloud, with Creative revenue growing to $1.3 billion.\nAt Adobe, we believe everyone has a story to tell. Our strategy to empower more of the world\u2019s storytellers to express themselves depends on our ability to make our tools more accessible, enjoyable and invaluable to a broader set of creative customers, from creative pros, to hobbyists, to young creatives. Experience Design is one of our fastest growing creative segments and we recently introduced a new starter plan for Adobe XD, our all-in-one UX/UI design platform. Adobe XD is the most modern, cloud-based solution available for designing, prototyping and collaborating with colleagues across multiple platforms. We recently announced several new integrations between XD and designers\u2019 existing workflows inside of tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator.\nWe launched a $10 million design investment fund to support designers and developers who innovate and push the boundaries of Experience Design. Enabling creativity in the Education segment remains a passion for Adobe. Adobe Spark Premium, our application for everyday communicators to transform their ideas into beautiful visual stories, is now available to every student globally. We\u2019ve achieved strong adoption of Spark in school districts across the nation. To further bolster our commitment to K-12 students, we introduced a new offering that gives students more affordable access to applications including Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and XD. These actions are part of our commitment to partner with educators, promote STEAM, and ensure art and creativity remain an essential part of education and professional development.\nAdobe\u2019s video editing and production tools, including Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, are the gold standard for creating films and video from the silver screen to the mobile screen. At NAB, Adobe unveiled innovative updates to Creative Cloud\u2019s digital video tools. In addition, partners including Canon, RED Cameras, AMD, and Sony announced tools and updates that allow users to work in an integrated, collaborative production environment.\nOur mission is to push the limits of creativity and storytelling while supporting exciting new mediums. We provided a sneak peek of Project Aero, a powerful new augmented reality, or AR authoring tool at Apple\u2019s WWDC last week. Project Aero is a system that makes it easier for designers and developers to create immersive content and bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. With close to 1 billion AR-enabled devices expected to be in market next year, AR can drive a new wave of digital transformation and creativity.\nIn addition to the world\u2019s best desktop and mobile tools, Creative Cloud services are driving growth in our business while offering new ways to inspire our customers and accelerate their creative process. Adobe Stock achieved record revenue in the quarter, with greater than 25% year-over-year growth. Adobe Stock now has a library of more than 100 million images, videos and creative assets including new curated HD and 4K videos, as well as Motion Graphics templates.\nAdobe Document Cloud is the world\u2019s leading digital document service, enabling individuals and businesses to digitize inefficient paper-based processes. In Q2, we achieved record revenue for Document Cloud of $243 million. Document Cloud subscriptions and Acrobat perpetual licensing drove 22% year-over-year revenue growth, and $47 million in net new Document Cloud ARR.\nThis week marks the 25th anniversary of Acrobat and PDF, the innovation that ushered in the era of digital documents. 25 years later, the pace at which we\u2019re innovating with Document Cloud has only accelerated as digital documents become more collaborative and mobile. More than 800 million PDFs are opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader on mobile devices each month. Adobe Scan, our mobile PDF creation app powered by Adobe Sensei that turns your phone or tablet into a scanning and text recognition tool, has been downloaded more than 10 million times.\nAdobe Sign, our digital signature solution for Document Cloud, continues to have strong momentum. Today, over half of Fortune 100 companies use Adobe Sign. Last September, we teamed up with Microsoft to integrate Adobe Sign into Microsoft Office 365. Next week, we\u2019ll be unveiling industry-first innovations in Adobe Sign focused on delivering superior digital document experiences to millions of customers.\nAdobe Experience Cloud is the most comprehensive, integrated, and actionable set of solutions in the market, designed to help companies deliver consistent, continuous and compelling experiences across every touch point and channel. In Q2, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $586 million, and strong bookings across Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics Cloud and Adobe Advertising Cloud. Key customer deals in the quarter included Audible, Intuit, Shell, H&R Block, Japan Airlines, PNC Bank and Samsung.\nIn May, we announced our intent to acquire Magento, a leading commerce platform. Commerce is an integral part of an end-to-end customer experience as consumers and businesses now expect every interaction to be shoppable. The addition of Magento Commerce will enable commerce to be seamlessly integrated into Adobe Experience Cloud, delivering a single platform that serves both B2B and B2C customers globally while providing the flexibility to scale to serve mid-market and large enterprise customers. The Magento Platform is supported by a robust community of more than 300,000 developers and a partner ecosystem that provides thousands of pre-built extensions, including payment, shipping, tax and logistics.\nThe acquisition of Magento will make Adobe the only company with leadership in content creation, marketing, advertising, analytics and now commerce, enabling real-time personalized experiences across the entire customer journey, whether on the web, mobile, social, in-product or in-store. We believe the addition of Magento expands our available market opportunity, builds out our product portfolio, and addresses a key underserved customer need.\nWhen combined with our world-class content and data platform, and leveraging our Sensei machine learning and AI framework, this latest capability will further differentiate Adobe Experience Cloud as the leading platform for Experience Businesses. We expect the acquisition to close next week.\nWe continue to host successful customer Summits across the globe where we roll out new innovations across Adobe Experience Cloud, including major enhancements to the Adobe Cloud Platform. Recent advancements include a new Unified Customer Profile that combines data across an enterprise, intelligent services, and General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR readiness, all aimed at solving key challenges facing marketers, data scientists and developers.\nAdobe was once again recognized for our leadership in technology segments that help to deliver and orchestrate experiences across the entire customer journey. We were named a Leader in the Forrester Wave: Digital Asset Management for Customer Experience, achieving the highest score for current offering of the vendor leaders. Adobe was positioned as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Marketing Hubs. In this inaugural report, Adobe had the strongest ranking for completeness of vision among the 21 vendors evaluated.\nAdobe Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework forms the foundation of the innovative Adobe Magic across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. We were pleased to be recognized again as one of the World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies by Forbes for 2018.\nThe talent and passion of our more than 18,000 employees worldwide continues to be the catalyst for Adobe\u2019s success. We take pride in making Adobe one of the world\u2019s best workplaces and cultivating a diverse and innovative team of global employees. This summer, we\u2019re pleased to welcome over 1,000 interns and university graduates to Adobe, the largest such group in company history.\nAdobe has the right strategy, partners, products and people in place to win. We look forward to building on the momentum we\u2019re driving across our entire business and expect a strong second half of the year.\nJohn?\nJohn Murphy\nThanks, Shantanu.\nIn the second quarter of FY18, Adobe\u2019s momentum continued with record revenue of $2.20 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.33 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.66. We drove strong performance across our product offerings and geographies during the quarter.\nHighlights in Q2 included record Digital Media revenue, including Creative revenue of $1.30 billion and Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $243 million; record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $586 million; net new Digital Media ARR of $343 million, and exiting Q2 with $5.37 billion of Creative ARR; deferred revenue growth of 27% year-over-year; cash flow from operations of $976 million; returning $589 million of cash to our stockholders through stock buyback; and approximately 89% of our revenue in Q2 was from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 28% year-over-year. The addition of $343 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $6.06 billion exiting Q2.\nWithin Digital Media, we achieved another record quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 29% year-over-year in Q2 and we increased Creative ARR by $296 million. Several key factors helped drive this growth, including strong net new subscriptions across user segments and geographies, helped by robust traffic and conversion on adobe.com; continued momentum with Creative Cloud adoption in emerging markets; stable or increasing ARPU across key offerings, which continues to be driven by retention of users on promotional prices migrating to standard prices, as well as attachment of services in the enterprise and the recently introduced price increase in North America; and strong growth with Adobe Stock.\nWith Document Cloud, we achieved record revenue of $243 million, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. The performance in Q2 was driven by continued momentum with Acrobat subscription adoption as well as strength in the enterprise with Acrobat and Document Cloud services.\nIn our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $586 million, which represents 18% year-over-year revenue growth. Subscription revenue grew 24% year-over year. Experience Cloud performance in Q2 was driven by success across our Analytics Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Advertising Cloud offerings. Experience Cloud data transactions grew to 97 trillion in the quarter, with 60% of Analytics transactions driven by mobile device usage.\nFrom a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $15.2 million. We had $0.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY18, versus $1 million in hedge gains in Q1 of FY18; thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $14.5 million.\nFrom a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $51.3 million. We had $0.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY18, versus $13.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 of FY17; thus, the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $38.3 million.\nIn Q2, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 4% on a GAAP-basis and 5% on a non-GAAP basis. These rates are below the targets we provided due to a structural change we made during Q2 in how we serve foreign customers based on the new U.S. Tax Act. Our recent international tax structure change will benefit our tax rates for the remainder of FY2018 as well as next year.\nOur trade DSO was 44 days, which compares to 46 days in the year-ago quarter, and 47 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.63 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $6.33 billion. Cash flow from operations was $976 million in the quarter.\nIn Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a cost of $589 million. We currently have $900 million remaining of our $2.5 billion authority granted in January 2017. We expect this authorization to be exhausted by the end of this fiscal year. On May 21st, we announced that our Board had authorized an incremental $8 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal year 2021, which will be funded from future cash flow generation.\nNow, I will provide our financial outlook. In January, we updated our financial targets to reflect provisions of the new U.S. Tax Act which became law during our fiscal Q1. The Tax Act affords companies like Adobe the ability to make changes to the way we serve our foreign customers with our international corporate structure. During Q2, we made a structural change and the effect of it results in even lower tax rates than we discussed previously for both this year and subsequent fiscal years.\nIn fiscal 2018, we anticipate an incremental 6 percentage-point reduction in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates when compared to the rates we provided in January. We are now expecting a GAAP tax rate of approximately 7% in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2018; and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 5% in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2018. Our November fiscal year calendar and the timing of certain Tax Act provisions make our FY18 a unique year from a tax rate perspective. We indicated in January that we anticipated our tax rates would stabilize at a new rate of approximately 18% on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis in FY19. Based on the structural change we made in Q2, we now estimate our tax rates in FY19 will stabilize at GAAP and non-GAAP rates of approximately 14%.\nTurning to Q3 FY18, we are targeting revenue of approximately $2,240,000,000; Digital Media segment year over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 15%; tax rate of approximately 7% on a GAAP basis, and 5% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 498 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.27; non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.68; and net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $310 million.\nOur Q3 targets do not reflect our pending acquisition of Magento Commerce. We have received regulatory clearance and anticipate closing the acquisition next week. For the second half of calendar year 2018, Magento\u2019s internal plan projected achieving approximately $100 million in revenue. After the transition to Adobe\u2019s November fiscal calendar and the write-down of deferred revenue due to purchase accounting rules, we anticipate Adobe will report approximately $40 million of Magento revenue in the second half of Adobe\u2019s fiscal 2018, with approximately $10 million of it in our fiscal Q3. We expect the closing of Magento to be slightly dilutive to our Q3 GAAP earnings per share target. We do not expect the closing to impact our non-GAAP Q3 earnings per share target. In Q4, we anticipate normal seasonal strength and a strong finish to the year.\nI\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mike.\nMike Saviage\nThanks, John.\nAdobe MAX returns to Los Angeles this fall, and Day One of our user conference is Monday October 15th. We plan to host a financial analyst meeting on the afternoon of the 15th, and an invitation with registration information will be sent out in early July. More details about MAX are available at max.adobe.com.\nIf you wish to listen to a playback of today\u2019s conference call, a web-based archive of the call will be available on our IR site later today. Alternatively, you can listen to a phone replay by calling 855-859-2056; use conference ID number 4599054. International callers should dial 404-537-3406. The phone playback service will be available beginning at 5 pm Pacific Time today, and ending at 5 pm Pacific Time on June 20, 2018.\nWe would now be happy to take your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session \nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty\nYes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Looking at the results, the revenue in Digital Media, both in the quarter and from the outlook is better than expected, despite the Digital Media ARR coming in line. I am wondering if there\u2019s something that\u2019s improving the revenue conversion in the quarters or some other factor that\u2019s allowing that to happen?\nShantanu Narayen\nSterling, I\u2019ll take that. I think, as we look at Digital Media, as you pointed out, ARR was again strong across all different segments. Retention continues to be in line with expect. Acrobat Perpetual had a good quarter. So, Acrobat, as it related to both licensing and perpetual was strong as well as Stock. So, I think across the board we continue to focus on converting ARR to revenue.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin\nI wanted to ask on the Experience Cloud business, clearly showed some really nice acceleration in the quarter on a much tougher comp to last year. So, I wanted to ask if kind of what changes have you observed, what strengthening, renewal activity and up sell, any comments would be helpful and how sustainable do you expect some of these trends to be?\nShantanu Narayen\nAlex, big picture, I think we\u2019re very pleased with our performance in the Experience business. I think, the metric that we look at a lot was the subscription revenue growth. If you look at the subscription revenue growth in the quarter, that was 24% year-over-year. I think in the prepared remarks we said, it was across the Marketing Cloud, Analytics Cloud as well as the Advertising Cloud. Again, digital transformation is front and center as an imperative for every single organization. Without a doubt, we have the clear leadership position in that. The value proposition is very unique. We\u2019re getting larger deals. We\u2019ve talked about the multi-solution opportunities that we have. I would say, particularly in the quarter as well, with the two summits that we organized and the interest that we have in summits, as closing opportunities for us. And last but not least, partnership with Microsoft where we\u2019re jointly going in and engaging with customers at higher levels. So, I\u2019d just point to continued leadership on the product and vision side and focus on execution in the quarter.\nAlex Zukin\nThank you, guys.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jeffries. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill\nThanks. Shantanu, just following up on digital experience, the first half of the year, you actually outpaced your yearend growth rate target and you have easier comps in the back half of this year. So, I\u2019m just curious in terms of why not take up your aspirations there? Is there something that\u2019s worrying you in the second half? Obviously, you\u2019ll have Magento layer in as well. So, are you just kind of waiting for that to layer in before you update your aspirations there?\nShantanu Narayen\nI think, in terms of overall, as you know, Brent, we do not update our full year guidance. At this point, we\u2019re coming into what has been the Q3 seasonal quarter in Europe. But, the interest and the excitement or aspirations haven\u2019t diminished in any way. As you point out, it was a strong quarter. We have with Magento even more of a comprehensive offering and so, particularly remain excited. But it\u2019s -- I won\u2019t read anything into it except for the fact that we -- we did touch on the fact that Q4 will continue to be seasonally strong. So, should proceed as expected.\nBrent Thill\nAnd just a quick follow-up for John on ARPU. I think, last quarter, you said ARPU was kind of up across the board. I think now, you\u2019re saying flat to up. Given the price increases, can you just maybe parse that? And I know we\u2019re probably digging in on a metric that we\u2019re probably going too deep into, but any color there why that won\u2019t be up and up like we saw in Q1?\nJohn Murphy\nNo. I think what we said is that it's stable and that we expect it to remain stable to up. So, also, I think it\u2019s really from our perspective a healthy metric. We don\u2019t guide to that or target externally but this really contributes to our ARR.\nShantanu Narayen\nMaybe just adding color, Brent, on that as it relates to the enterprise licensing, nothing has changed, as we see enterprise licensing, we\u2019re certainly seeing good adoption of the full offering from the customized versions that we had said. As it relates to the price, since you asked that question, we always expected it to be marginal in terms of the impact associated with that. We\u2019re pleased with what we have seen so far in terms of whether it\u2019s people buying new subscriptions or renewal, where people see the price increase, I think that is very much in line with the additional value that we provided. So, on Digital Media, we continue to be excited about the opportunity.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Your line is open.\nJennifer Lowe\nGreat. Thank you. I wanted to follow up a little bit on subscription growth that you\u2019re seeing with Creative Cloud outside of the U.S. and in particular in geographies outside of the U.S., and I guess in two pieces. First, I think last year, one of the talking points was that Japan and Germany were still relatively early in the transition from on-prem to cloud. So, I\u2019m curious if we sort of have any update on the rate of the base migration there. And then, related as you think about subscriber growth in emerging markets, I\u2019m curious if you have sort of an update on how much of that sort of piracy conversion versus net new users to the base.\nShantanu Narayen\nYes. Jennifer, I think globally, when we look at the demand for the creative solutions and specifically the cloud offerings, I think we\u2019ve stated that Japan and Germany and the other emerging markets were phase shifted from the United States and Australia where we first introduced the offerings on the learnings that we\u2019ve had about how to acquire customers and convert them whether they be new customers to the platform or as you point out former pirates. We have certainly learnt from that. We continue to think that the differential pricing that we have in countries like China as well as Southeast Asia is helping us. There is more creativity in those markets. So, Japan and Germany net-net continue to be good areas of growth for us moving forward. The emerging markets, both the piracy as well as the attractive upfront pricing are reasons why people are adopting the platform.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick\nThank you very much and congrats on a great quarter. Shantanu, can you share with us, what the learnings have been from the price increase you introduced in North America this quarter and your observations on elasticity?\nShantanu Narayen\nYes. I think, Brad, it\u2019s early. I would actually point to the learnings that we\u2019ve had from the foreign exchange changes that have happened in other countries and as a result of that what we have done with respect to pricing. Our strategy continues to be how do we get more and more people on the platform. And so you know, we continue to attract new customers with attractive pricing. And during the first year, the more engagement that we have with them, the more they are likely to add the standard pricing continue in renewal. And so, renewal continues to be an area of focus for us. And again, the goal for us right now is attracting new customers to the platform. Everything we\u2019ve done with respect to price changes has not impacted retention. And so, we continue to focus on that blend, if that makes sense.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia\nShantanu, realizing that it still has to close, can you just talk about initial customer feedback on Magento? It\u2019s been a few weeks. And any early ideas, broad brushes that you can share with us on how the business can look different as part of the Adobe family, post closing?\nShantanu Narayen\nSure, Saket. I mean, I think, despite the fact that we already had integrations with commerce systems, we had clear ask from our customers for a complete Adobe solution from content creation to delivery to analytics and now all the way out to commerce. What we are particularly excited about is the investment that we\u2019ve made in the Adobe Cloud platform provides a clear architecture and a playbook for us to integrate new acquisitions like Magento, seamlessly.\nWe were attracted by a few things when we looked at Magento, great people, great technology. But I think what\u2019s unique was that they targeted both digital and physical goods as well as B2B and B2C in terms of the customer segments. And Mark, who is their CEO, did a great job of leading them after they transitioned out of eBay. While their traditional strength has been in the mid market and departments or single geographies where large enterprises use them for commerce in one geography and then translate it, I think that will continue to be an area of good opportunity for us. And what we will bring to that is the enterprise relationships that we have with larger enterprise. So, like all our acquisitions, we look at it from the point of view of can we accelerate their growth, does it fill out our offering that we have a unique and differentiated solution. And the good news was, Magento, I think checked all of those boxes. And so, we\u2019re excited about it, as we said, hopefully it closes next week. And we\u2019ve given you some transparency into the size of their business.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nMark Moerdler\nCongrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. So, I\u2019m going to follow-up on the questions on Magento. Discuss how Magento has had strength in selling the digital goods Adobe\u2019s -- digital marketing is all about digital marking but both digital and electronic. How big a nuance, how big a difference is there, how big an opportunity is there? The fact that they are so strong in selling the digital goods and how does that play into the existing customer base that Adobe has in digital marketing?\nShantanu Narayen\nYes. Mark, I think from our point of view, we just want a very comprehensive solution. When you go into a retail customer, for example with Digital Experience who is making available for sale physical goods, we say, yes, we have the ability for you to transact and finalize your sale for physical goods that\u2019s shipping. That doesn\u2019t mean that we are in shipping our sales, but the ability to have that inventory, the building materials, the payment methods is clearly an advantage in terms of them taking non-digital way of transacting commerce and converting it to commerce. What\u2019s also nice about them is for people who want to do rooms or airline reservations or other digital ways of transacting business, the same solution scales from physical goods to digital goods. Things like subscription, what Adobe offers. I think, we would all acknowledge that more and more companies want to get to a subscription mechanism. And so, I think, I would look at it more as a comprehensive way of dealing with anything that needs to be transacted online, whether the end result was a physical good or digital good or subscription, being able to have a comprehensive offering across B2B and B2C is really helpful. And what I mean by B2B is you might have companies whether they\u2019re consumer goods companies or companies that are actually shipping to other retailers who also want to use this to transact business electronically. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting for us about what Magento offers.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC. Your line is open.\nRoss MacMillan\nShantanu, congrats on the quarter. You look like you\u2019re tracking again this year to something around 1.3 billion of net new Digital Media ARR. And we\u2019re just coming up into a period where you\u2019re starting to move on price, you have some new product introductions, there are some ARPU effects from Stock. Just philosophically, how do you think about the progress of that net new ARR, as we think about that, no just this year, but broadly speaking over the next two or three years? And do you feel like there are levers that you have to manage that number to a sort of target? And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for sustainability on that line item. Thanks.\nShantanu Narayen\nYes, Ross. Again, when we look at the ARR accomplishment and entire Digital Media performance in the first half, it\u2019s very clear that we continue to have momentum across all of the various offerings, as well as geographies. I think, if you look at our Q3, and then I\u2019ll get to the picture, we do expect Q3 is seasonally weak. And we\u2019ve said that we expect the traditional strength in Q4. One of the things that we are discontinuing to monitor in Q3 is what\u2019s happened with GDPR and the recent privacy law changes is that everybody who is doing business online in Europe, will have to make sure that GDPR is not sort of just the checklist item but a new ways of doing business which requires people to tailor their digital marketing. We were ready with that on May 25th. We just want to continue to monitor that as we transact business online. We are best-in-class both for ourselves as well as for the service that we deliver for our customers. And so, we look at the 310 million target for ARR; it\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve actually had in Q3 for Digital Media. To your point, it should result in record ARR addition in this business for FY18. But long-term, as you think about new media types, as you think about devices, what we are doing across education, immersive media opportunities with AR and VR, screen design, video and the explosion of video, I think, you\u2019ll continue to see us innovate more, attract new customers to the platform, and really drive the addressable opportunities. So, that\u2019s really is the focus for us in that business.\nRoss MacMillan\nAnd just a quick follow-up, if I can, for John. Welcome, just on the tax rate that new run rate of 14%, is that something that in the absence of material geographic revenue mix shift or M&A, is that something that you would view as broadly a sort of stable run rate, even beyond fiscal \u201819?\nJohn Murphy\nYes. Thanks, Ross. I think, how I would describe it is with the new Tax Act, we\u2019ve been digesting the different impacts to that. And so, you see as we made this recent change, again after just starting in January. So, we do feel this rate is stable, but we continue to evaluate opportunities with the provisions of the tax law. And just to remind you, our fiscal year \u201818 is really unique for us. So, we don\u2019t have the full effects of the Tax Act until FY19. But I think you can rely on those rates at this point, to be relatively stable. And then, as we continue to evaluate opportunities, take advantage of the provisions, we can update them.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open.\nJay Vleeschhouwer\nShantanu, a technology roadmap question for you regarding Digital Experience. How much of a role do you think there may ultimately be for you to have a self-serve model in the portfolio in digital experience, paralleling what you\u2019ve done with Digital Media, particularly with adobe.com. The reason I\u2019m asking is was the launch of Advertising Cloud Creative at Summit for instance perhaps an early sign of a longer term ambition for more comprehensive self-serve capability that you can deliver to customers for Digital Experience. If that\u2019s so, would there then be positive incremental margin implications, as you\u2019ve seen on the Digital Media side from that kind of a model?\nShantanu Narayen\nI think, Jay, there is no question that a focus on time to value and getting more practitioners adopting our digital experience solution sooner rather than later is a priority for us. We\u2019ve certainly, to your point, done that with Acrobat and CC. Magento is a really nice addition to that, because if people can create a website, start doing it with their customers through multiple channels and transact business through commerce, that opens up new vistas for us. And if you remember, the original Day Software as well as what Omniture had, actually targeted small and medium businesses. So, I look at it as, are we focused on continuing to drive time to value and getting more practitioners to be self served. That\u2019s only a benefit in terms of their NPS with Adobe. And it\u2019s clearly an area of focus for us.\nJay Vleeschhouwer\nA quick one for John. Could you talk about the implications for cash flow from the new cash structure, both in terms of not just net income, which is obviously going to be affected on the GAAP side but also perhaps in terms of deferred tax implications within cash flow?\nJohn Murphy\nClearly, we benefit from the tax rate changes. And I think what we\u2019ve demonstrated is that our business continues to throw cash flow strength in growth. So, I would just say that that trend is pretty consistent.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open.\nWalter Pritchard\nJust a further question around pricing. You\u2019ve talked about services for some time and stock I think continues to do well. Can you help us understand how services are impacting pricing versus some of these other factors, especially the price increase that just started to have impact this quarter, maybe a stack rank or kind of relative conversation about the drivers of ARPU?\nShantanu Narayen\nSure, Walter. I mean, I think as it relates to Adobe Stock, that is clear service. It makes the entire offerings sticker. And I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that Stock had a very strong quarter, I think it continues to make the whole aspect of an on-ramp to creativity easier. So, that\u2019s been good. I would say in the enterprise in particular as people are finding that whether you\u2019re interfacing between freelancers and the marketing or graphics departments within enterprises, storing all of these assets, so that you can increase content velocity, things like Adobe Sign, all of them are causing us to be able to both deliver better value and charge more to our enterprise customers. So, in the enterprises in particular, we\u2019re very maniacally focused on named user deployment, ensuring more people use it within an enterprise, having services be the win, which they can engage more people in the creative process. And that\u2019s leading to both greater ARPU as well as new seat deployment within the enterprise.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nHeather Bellini\nI just had a question about, as we look at your revenue targets, Shantanu, and as you look out a few years, is there a reason to think that the pace of expense growth, which we\u2019ve been seeing, would change at all? You guys have done such a great job kind of growing expenses at such a much lower pace obviously than revenue. I am just wondering if there is any reason to think that kind of the pace of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of expense growth would change based on what your revenue plans might be down the road.\nShantanu Narayen\nThat\u2019s a great question, Heather, in terms of how we think about it. And I think as a company, we\u2019re just being ruthlessly focused on both top line and bottom line growth. I mean you are driving 24% year-over-year growth in revenue, but driving 60% growth in non-GAAP EPS, I think it shows that we\u2019re really focused on both of those. We just have some very significant opportunities. And I think as you think about Q2, maybe there were a couple of investments in the Adobe Cloud platform as well as in preparation for GDPR that were factored in. But I think long-term, we just continue to ensure that are we driving great top line growth at a very profitable margin, and we\u2019re going to continue as we did in Q1, for example, all revenue overachievement will result in greater earnings and that continues to be our focus.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI, your line is open.\nKirk Materne\nShantanu, I was wondering if you could just -- I want to go back to Magento again. And could you just walk us through I guess how you\u2019re thinking about the integration? I assume given the time of your fiscal year, it\u2019ll operate generally on a standalone basis. But, is this a product that the Adobe sales force can start taking to market once the deal closes? I guess, just how are you thinking about sort of integrating, I guess mainly from a go to market perspective once the deal closes over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.\nShantanu Narayen\nKirk, I think, the sales force is already chomping at the bits in terms of saying how do we, once the deal is closed, have Magento in our bag. It\u2019s such a natural extension. But, I think to your point, our focus has always been with acquisitions, do no harm, really make sure that we can continue to bring to bear the Adobe brand, bring to bear the customer relationships that we have and truly understand the magic sauce that makes them so special. So, certainly, in terms of from day one when we are closing being able to expand our story of how we can serve customers, looking at some of the customers. And I think we pointed that out in the introductory call in terms of who they already have as customers. So, I think, we will start to deliver to enterprises but we will be a little cautious because we just want to make sure that we have discipline on-ramp to that particular product.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.\nDerrick Wood\nGreat, thanks. I wanted to touch, drilling in on GDPR. And one could argue, it could have some mixed impact for you guys. The regulation focuses on data minimization in terms of the amount of content companies should be storing about their end consumers and email lists have to be more scrutinized. And I guess that could weigh on capacity subscription sales. But at the same time, companies are needing to put more governance and workflow around their digital engagements and we could see more standardization and more usage on the Adobe platform. You clearly had a good quarter, but how do you see these dynamics around GDPR working out and impacting the demand trajectory on Experience Cloud.\nShantanu Narayen\nWhen I take a step back, Derrick, the trend towards online businesses and digital spend and the desire on the part of enterprises to understand attribution is only going to increase. More money is going to be spent digitally but the bar of how that\u2019s being spent and the understanding and effectiveness of that marketing and spend is only going to increase. And I think big picture, we look at that as a big opportunity for Advertising Cloud, because not only are we a channel for the major online marketing platforms like search, social, display and TV, but we are unique and that we have sort of the broadest perspective of efficacy across all marketing expense.\nOn the second side, all companies will need to balance the customer acquisition where this third-party data plays an important role. And the more important issue for all companies is going to be customer engagement, to your question around email list and how you engage with them. And then, I think leveraging the first-party data is going to become even more crucial. And so, we look at it and say we have the best of both worlds. The Advertising Cloud will continue to focus on helping customer acquisition, but really the energy is going to be spent by companies more on Marketing Cloud where engagement is going to be even more critical in this world of GDPR, so that you don\u2019t in any way impact the trust that you have built with companies. And I actually think analytics also across both acquisition and engagement will become even more critical in this new environment. So, you\u2019re right in that we have to help our companies navigate it and you\u2019re right. And I think long-term, it just continues to be a tailwind as the leader in this business.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss\nI just had a clarification question around the guidance. Last quarter, Mark Garrett was talking about Digital Media ARR and talking about Q3 and Q4, the expected seasonality of Q3 and Q4 to follow similar to what was achieved in FY17. And when I look at ARR from last year, Q2 to Q3 was pretty sort of flat seasonality. It looks like we are looking for closer to like down 9% to 10% this year. Is something changed between sort of Mark Garrett\u2019s comments and sort of how we are thinking about ARR into Q3 this quarter?\nShantanu Narayen\nNo, Keith. I think, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, when you look at from an absolute perspective, the Q3 target that we provided for ARR will still be the largest that we have. I think we continue to see strength in the business and nothing\u2019s changed from that particular quarter. I mentioned briefly that we want to just make sure that we get a little bit more experience with what\u2019s happening with GDPR to Derrick and other peoples questions associated with what\u2019s happening online but in no way reflects a change in how we see the business. And Q4 again, we expect the traditional strength in the business.\nKeith Weiss\nSo, some caution perhaps around GDPR, potentially questioning some Digital Media business from Q3 into Q4?\nShantanu Narayen\nI think, we look at it from first half second half and we still continue to model it, but you can look at it as we just want to make sure that we underpin GDPR in more detail across Q3. Yes.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan\nShantanu, I\u2019m just curious, if you look at companies like in your peer groups Microsoft, Intuit, they have had revenue growth in some of the key businesses outpace unit growth. Obviously, pricing and ARPU growth has been a key trend of the industry. I\u2019m curious how you think about that. Are you at a point where it\u2019s more so ARPU growth versus unit growth? If so, what is driving that? If you on the contrary believe what you said, on the previous earnings conference call that the TAM is a multiple of the previous cycle. I was curious to hear you elaborate on why you believe the TAM as a multiple of the prior cycle. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nShantanu Narayen\nYes. I mean, I think when we look at the two businesses where we have a B2C business, when we look at Acrobat and units growth for Acrobat, all the strength in the Document Cloud businesses is being driven by unit growth rather than what you would call ARPU growth. When we look at customer acquisition in Creative Cloud, we\u2019ve been pretty forthcoming about how it\u2019s really being driven by few people coming to our platform. And so I can\u2019t comment on what Microsoft and Intuit are saying, but from our point of view, it\u2019s certainly being driven not more by few customer acquisitions and focus on that. And so, as we thing about big picture, what we are focused on in creative, the first is let\u2019s just continue to drive net new subscriptions, focused on retention, the pool is becoming larger and larger. So, this is in emerging markets. I would say a little bit more adjacent markets, what we\u2019ve done with education and hobbyists. We continue to make sure that ARPUs are increasing as people go into renewals. But price is not on that first list of things that we\u2019re focused on, given where we\u2019re in the cycle.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nPat Walravens\nShantanu, I\u2019m going to step back a little bit. And I\u2019m curious how far -- I'm sorry, the artificial intelligence side of things. How far away are we from having Sensei help customers search video content with a high degree of accuracy, Sensei find all the footages that has Brad Pitt in it.\nShantanu Narayen\nPat, I think if you look at what we already have with respect to Adobe Stock, the two things that I would call Adobe magic that Sensei has provided is first auto tagging. So, you can actually get thousands of pictures and we have the ability based on the prior data set to be able to tag it and infer intent. And so, you can search. And the economical example we give us fire engine versus being it called different things in different countries. And so, we already have that. With video as well I think we have the ability across frames to do searching. And so, it\u2019s only going to get better and better with the data sets. But that data is not far in terms of being able to find across video. And in fact, we have already demonstrated abilities to do search on video.\nMike Saviage\nOperator, we\u2019re coming up on the hour. Why don\u2019t we take one more question, please?\nOperator\nAnd your last question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal. Your line is open.\nBrian Wieser\nI was wondering if you could offer a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing with Advertising Cloud. You called it certainly as supporting some growth there. And we see some of the peers to that business in particular doing phenomenally well. And related GDPR, as we\u2019re seeing something with shake out with much of the ad tech sector, I\u2019m wondering if you see opportunities for deeper investment. It seems like anyone with deep pockets a long time horizon is maybe well-positioned to take advantage just growing organically or by picking up businesses that are now available.\nShantanu Narayen\nWe had a good strong revenue quarter for Advertising Cloud in Q2. I think if you look at our overall revenue growth of 18%, it was certainly higher than what we had guided to. Advertising Cloud played a role in that. I think, to your point, we are one of the few companies that has the brand to have the ability for people to invest across search, social, display and all forms of TV. And so, I think, we\u2019re pretty uniquely positioned. I think what\u2019s even more unique about our offering is the tie-in to the segmentation that we have with audience manager and the analytics that we provide on the efficacy of the spend. So, we continue to be excited about the opportunity that we have both in Advertising Cloud as a separate cloud an opportunity, and the integration of that across the entire Experience Cloud.\nAnd since Brian that was the last question, in close, the momentum in our business clearly continued in Q2. We continue to be excited about the product roadmap that we will deliver in the second half and the innovation agenda. Big picture, the strategy of empowering people to create, as well as helping businesses transform, continue to be large addressable markets with good tailwinds, and we continue to focus on driving both top-line and bottom-line growth with significant margins while we invest in technology as a long-term differentiator for Adobe. Thank you for joining us today.\nMike Saviage\nThanks, everyone. This concludes our call.\n\n",

My name is Regina, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. (Operator\u2019s Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. \nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Miss Barbara Gasper, Group Executive of Investor Relations. Please proceed. \nBarbara Gasper\nThank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, either by phone or webcast, for a discussion about our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Bob Selander, our Chief Executive Officer, Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as Ajaypal Banga, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Following comments by Bob and Martina highlighting some of the key points about the business environment and our fourth quarter and full year results, we will open up the call for your questions. This morning\u2019s earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. The earnings release and the slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week until February 12. \nFinally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. \nWith that, I would like to now turn the call over to Bob Selander. Bob?\nRobert W. Selander\nThanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start out by saying that I am very pleased that we have been able to deliver another strong quarter of earnings results. This is indicative of the underlying momentum of our business, including several new and renewed deals that we have signed over the past several months. I will have more to say about some of these deals a little later. \nIn the fourth quarter, we saw net revenue growth of 6% on an as reported basis, and 2.2% on a constant currency basis. While the weakening U.S. dollar has created a tailwind for us this quarter, we also saw encouraging signs with regard to key aspects of our business. Gross dollar volumes, or GDV, grew 5.3% on a local currency basis. We experienced continued growth in process transactions, and cross border volumes have returned to positive growth. We also began to see the impact of some of our deals in our rebate and incentive line. Total operating expenses increased for the quarter, primarily driven by higher marketing investments and severance charges that we spoke to on our last call. And I am pleased that net income grew 21% for the quarter, excluding any special items. \nWe delivered strong financial results for the full year with net revenue growth of 2.1% on an as reported basis, or almost 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding onetime items, we delivered an operating margin improvement of 5.5 percentage points over 2008. Adjusting for special items, as well as a gain from the sale of our remaining interest and ReadyCARD in 2008, net income grew approximately 27% for the year on a constant currency basis. \nThroughout 2009 we took important steps to improve our expense management and resource alignment to ensure that the company is well positioned for growth as the global economy continues to improve. With the exception of the United States, gross dollar volume grew double digit during the fourth quarter. We also saw growth of 6.7% in process transactions around the world. Overall, these results continued to underscore the strength that our global business model affords us, even in the current environment. \nTurning now to some recent trends in the economy and the state of the business in the U.S. and Europe, as we saw last week, U.S. GDP increased at an annual rate of 5.7% for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by exports and inventory building. While the overall trend is reassuring, personal consumption expenditures grew at only 2% for the same period, and there is no change to our outlook regarding the U.S. consumer. We continue to be cautious about the health of the consumer as reflected in recent spending trends, as well as the slow pace of real improvement for people\u2019s financial security, specifically in housing and unemployment. January\u2019s conference board consumer confidence index improved 2.3 points, signaling that overall general consumer confidence is stable to slightly improving in the U.S. \nThe short-term outlook was somewhat mixed. The percentage of consumers expecting an improvement in business conditions over the next six months decreased, while those anticipating conditions will worsen increased. While home prices were up for several months through November, they are still much below 2007, and home sales for the year dropped sharply by 23%. Although the rate of unemployment has leveled off and most economists do expect an improvement in the second half of 2010, it remains very high at 10%. Our own research indicates a wavering optimism, where consumers have grown weary of the slowdown and are preparing for it to last longer than they initially thought. A new mindset seems to be emerging which suggests that people are looking for opportunities to spend, while trying to balance the temptation to consume, with a need for restraint due to the realities of the environment. \nIn Europe, the EU consumer sentiment indicator improved somewhat in December, although it remained slightly negative reflecting a continuing overall pessimistic outlook by Euro\u2019s own consumers on the financial position of their households, the general economic situation, and towards unemployment and the rate of savings. \nOn a more positive note, European business sentiment improved in December, reflecting an expected improvement in general economic activity.  In summary, there are some encouraging signs in the recent economic data and consumer sentiment findings.  \nWe remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook, although our assumptions remain unchanged from those I shared with you last quarter.  We don't expect any meaningful global economic improvement until the second half of 2010.\nTurning to the MasterCard spending polls data for the U.S. retail sector.  Retail sales, excluding automobiles, increased 2.3% in the fourth quarter, with easier year over year comparisons supported by higher gasoline prices and a generally healthier holiday shopping season.  When you exclude both autos and gas, retail sales grew about 1.6%.  \nThe 2009 holiday shopping season returned to a more traditional pattern, with sales beginning on Black Friday and then holding momentum through December.  This was different from the 2008 season, where steep discounting ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday pulled a portion of the holiday sales into early November 2008.  The net result of differences in the 2008 versus 2009 periods shows a difficult comparison in November and an easier comparison in December of 2009.\nE-commerce sales benefited from disruptive weather events in the central region of the U.S. early in the month, with storms on the east coast the weekend before Christmas.  This weather prevented consumers from traveling to brick and mortar locations and helped drive online sales to a 17.7% growth rate in December.  E-commerce spending was up over 16% for the fourth quarter.  \nOur analysis shows that retailers did not have to employ broad discounting this holiday season.  Inventories appeared to be more aligned with demand which in turn may be resulting in better financials for retailers and a generally healthier retail environment as we head into 2010.  \nWhen we look at our MasterCard process volumes and transactions through the first four weeks of January we see the following.  Our cross border volumes continued to improve across all regions and were better than the fourth quarter which was low single digits.  Once again our Asia Pacific region continues to demonstrate significant growth on a sequential basis and U.S. cross border volumes have improved from low single digit declines and are now trending slightly positive.\nWhile not a perfect proxy for gross dollar volume, U.S. processed volume growth continues in the low single digit range.  Process volumes for the rest of the world also continued to improve relative to the fourth quarter.\nFinally, process transactions continued to grow in the mid-single digit range, tempered by Maestro losses in the UK versus last year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics.\nMartina Hund-Mejean\n\nThanks, Bob and good morning everyone.  Let me begin on page three of the deck where we'll focus on the 2009 actuals versus the 2008 non-GAAP column, which excludes special items.\nAs Bob said, we are pleased to cap off 2009 with strong fourth quarter financial results.  Fourth quarter net revenues grew 6% to $1.3 billion over the comparable period last year.  On a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 2.2%.  The revenue increase was primarily driven by pricing changes of approximately five percentage points, a 3.9% increase in cross border volume and a 6.7% increase in the number of processed transactions.  This was tempered by an increase in rebates and incentives.  \nWhile we have continued our focus on expense management, the 9.8% increase we saw in total operating expense for the quarter was driven by our plan for higher advertising and marketing spending and additional severance charges.  \nForeign exchange also contributed 3.2 percentage points to the increase.  As a result our operating income was $468 million for the quarter and the quarterly operating margin was 36.1%.  MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The decrease was primarily due to a more favorable mix of earnings, a lower state tax rate and a lower provision for tax reserve in the fourth quarter of 2009.  We delivered net income of $294 million or $2.24 per diluted share.  Please keep in mind that this includes $0.19 worth of severance related charges.  \nTurning to page four.  The global diversification of our business continues to underscore our ability to generate significant volume, transactions and revenue from regions outside of the United States, and has thus cushioned our business from some of the decline that we experienced in our U.S. business.    Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 5.3% on a local currency basis in the fourth quarter and grew 11% on a U.S. dollar converted basis to $674 billion.  We've seen good improvement in U.S. GDV which is down 3.4%.  Actually, a great improvement from the high single digit declines in the third quarter.  Across the rest of the world, GDV continued to grow a healthy 11% on a local currency basis or an increase of 21.6% on a U.S. dollar basis.\nWorldwide credit GDV growth was essentially flat on a local currency basis, improving from the mid-single digit declines in the third quarter.  U.S. credit GDV growth continues to improve on a sequential basis but is still down in the low teens range.  Credit GDV for the rest of the world continued to grow at 5.4% on a local currency basis, or 16.1% on a U.S. dollar basis.  \nWorldwide debit GDV grew 19.7% on a local currency basis.  This compares to about 11.5% growth in the fourth quarter of last year and is actually the highest quarterly rate of growth this year.  In the U.S. debit GDV volume grew at 10.5% and debit growth for the rest of the world was 31.3% primarily driven, once again by growth in our Asia Pacific, Middle East Africa region.  On a local currency  basis worldwide purchase volume grew 5.7% and U.S. purchase volume declined 1.3% for the quarter driven by a decline in credit volume.  \nLet's turn to cross border volumes.  Cross border volume growth on a local currency basis was up 3.9% .  We saw double digit growth in our Asia Pacific, Middle East Africa region, as well as strong cross border growth across our European businesses.  In the U.S. cross border volume growth was just slightly negative, a vast improvement from over the last four quarters when we experienced double digit declines in each quarter.  We did see a decrease in our Latin American region, due to a sharp drop-off in Venezuelan cross border activity.  Our cross border transaction growth in the fourth quarter also returned to double digit growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008.   \n \nWhen we look at processed transactions, they increase 6.7% compared with a year ago quarter to $5.9 billion.  In Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and select Latin American regions processed transactions grew at double digit rates.  With the exception of Europe, all of the regions grew at mid to high single digit rates.  Excluding the impact of the loss of two Maestro portfolios in the UK and one U.S. debit portfolio, processed transaction growth would have been in the low double digit range.  \nThe secondized (ph) shift from cash electronic payment forms continues to provide significant growth opportunities.  The number of MasterCard branded cards worldwide declined 1.3% to $966 million for the quarter primarily as a result of U.S. issuers purchasing accounts.  Excluding the U.S. the rest of the WorldCard issuance grew 7.3%.  As of December 31, 2009 there were approximately 1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued globally.\nNow let's turn to page five.  As I mentioned earlier net revenue for the fourth quarter grew 6% on an as recorded basis or 2.2% on a constant currency basis.  Domestic assessments increased 4.9% from the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to increased volumes partially offset by the repeal of some European pricing.  As you know, we agreed to pro-repeal some of our October 2008 pricing actions as part of an interim arrangement with the European commission effective July 2009.  \nCross border volume fees increased by 21.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to new pricing implemented during the quarter, most of which was rebated to customers.  Cross border volume growth of 12.1% on a U.S. dollar basis also contributed to the growth in this revenue line item.  \nTransaction processing fees increased 20.3% compared to the prior period.  Pricing changes introduced in the U.S. in April 2009 accounted for approximately half of the increase.  Growth in processed transactions accounted for most of the remaining increase.\nOther revenues increased 8.8% versus the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily driven by a number of items  such as compliance and penalty fees.  All of these factors that I just mentioned resulted in a 13.5% increase in gross revenue.\nAs Bob mentioned earlier we began to see the impact of some deals that closed in the quarter on the rebates and incentives lines.  Of the 35.1% increase, approximately two-thirds was due to new and renewed customer agreements and the other third was due to rebates associated with the new cross border pricing.  For the quarter, rebates and incentives represented 30.7% of gross revenues versus the 25.7% in the fourth quarter a year ago.\nNow we'll turn to page six for some detail on expenses.  During the fourth quarter total operating expenses increased 9.8% excluding special items.  This includes severance related charges of $38 million for the quarter.  Without the impact of severance in both this quarter and the year ago quarter, total operating expenses increased 7.4%.  Including special items total operating expenses increased 6.6% on constant currency basis.  \nThe increase was mainly driven by the following.  General and administrative expenses increased 1.6%, with currency fluctuations accounting for 2.3 percentage points of the increase.  G&A included the severance related charges.  Excluding those charges for both periods, general and administrative expenses decreased, actually 2.3% versus the same period in 2008.  Advertising and marketing expense increased by 25.1% versus a year ago period.  This increase represents incremental investment in priority countries, including funds originally anticipated to be deployed in the third quarter and increased investments in media, customer marketing and promotions.  Foreign currency fluctuations accounted for 5.4 percentage points of the increase.  \nNow let's turn to page seven and let's take a quick look at our strong 2009 full year performance which we're very proud of, when you consider the environment that we were facing at this time last year.  We delivered net income of $1.5 billion excluding special items or $11.19 per diluted share. Also excluding the gains from the sale of our Redecard investments in 2008, net income grew approximately 27% for 2009. And excluding seven charges in both years, net income grew approximately 32%. \nWe achieved full year net revenue of $5.1 billion, representing growth of 2.1% and on a constant currency basis net revenue 3.9%. Pricing adjustments contributed approximately 6 percentage points of the growth and net revenue growth for 2009 was also driven by process transaction growth of 6.9%. Its positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lower cross-border volumes on a $US basis, and higher rebates and incentives. Total operating expenses for the year declined 6.9%, excluding special items and declined 10.5% when you also exclude severance related charges in both periods. Finally, we saw over 2009 full year operating margins improved 5.5 percentage points to 44.5% from 39% in 2008, excluding special items in both years. \nMoving to the cash flow statement and the balance sheet highlights of page eight. We generated $284 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter, and end of the year with cash, cash equivalent and current investments of $2.9 billion. \nBefore moving on to our 2010 outlook, I'd just like to spend a minute one other CAPM structure item, many of you have asked about what happens to our Class B stock upon the fourth anniversary of our IPO in May. As you will recall following the conversion programs that we have run the last three years, shares of Class B common stock now represents just over 15% or approximately $20 million of our outstanding shares. When Class B ownership drops below 15% as a result of holder's voluntary election to convert the Class M shares and associated voting right will be automatically redeemed. Earlier this week, our board of directors approved plans for further Class D conversion programs that will begin after May 31st. We included a summary of these programs in our Form 8-K files earlier this morning.\nTurning to 2010, we believe the road ahead is a positive one, though there will undoubtedly be some challenges as we navigate through the first half of the year. We're carefully balancing our risks and opportunities looking at the realities of what's happening across the world. While most economic and consumer indicators are slowly improving, we expect challenges during the first half will be concentrated in the U.S. and in Europe. \nIn the U.S. there is still uncertainty in the industry around the implication of the credit card act, while this plays out we will of course determine our customers' actions with respect to their (inaudible) businesses. And in Europe we are making nice progress across the SEPA and Eastern European regions, although as I mentioned earlier this is being tempered by Maestro losses in the U.K. and the repeal of some 2008 pricing.\nWe're seeing encouraging signs in other parts of the world, for instance in Asia Pacific in some countries in Latin America we continue to expect double digit volume growth. Additionally, cross-border activity levels are picking up around the world, which as you know is an attractive revenue driver for us. \nAs outlined on slide nine, the following represents our current view of 2010 on a constant currency basis. We expect that net revenue growth will be better than the 3.9% growth we saw in 2009. Based on what we expect for the first few months of the year it is unlikely that in 2010 we can get back to our old 12%-15% average annual net revenue objective.  We expect some contribution from pricing though at a lower level than what we saw last year. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth revenue will continue to grow in a trajectory, a bit deeper than what we've experienced over the past two years, the sum variation between the quarters depending on our ideal activity. \nAs Bob mentioned earlier we are very pleased with the number of new and renewed deals that we have signed in 2009 and we look for this momentum to continue into 2010. As a result the rebate in intensive line will include the impact of both 2009 deals, as well as new agreements that we sign in 2010. Also included will be the impact of the new cross-border pricing that has a rebate component to it. So if you just think about it, rebates and incentives are just another form of reinvestment in our business, so it should not be surprising to see this line increase as we work to drive volume and new business opportunities.\nOver the last year or so we have made significant progress in realigning the expense base of our company in response to the realities of the market, we anticipate our total operating expenses will be flat to slightly down. At this point in time, we believe our expense realignment efforts are essentially behind us. We will continue to invest for future growth therefore you should be careful about factoring the entire benefit of the 2009 severance action into your model.\nTurning to advertising and marketing we currently expect to be up mid-single digits from (inaudible) full-year 2009 spent. If the market environment recovers faster than we currently expect we will then need to reassess and potentially increase our marketing support. \nIn terms of quarterly (inaudible) past years spending in the first quarter will be the lowest of the year. We are currently planning for the spend in the remaining three quarters to be relatively equal, although this is something that we will be evaluating on a quarter-by-quarter basis as the year progresses.\nFinally, we remain committed to our longer term objectives of annual merging expansion of three to five percentage points and average annual net income growth of 20%-30%. Remember, while all of our objectives are on a constant currency basis, our as-reported numbers will include any impact of foreign exchange; you are also assuming an effective tax rate of 34.5% for 2010. Overall, as we look at our performance expectations for 2010 we believe that we will be able to see her through the challenges in order to deliver another solid year.\nLet me now turn the call back to Bob to cover some recent business highlights.\nRobert W. Selander\nBefore moving in to the Question and Answer Session, I'd like to share with you some of our recent business successes and developments from around the world, beginning with some recent deal ends starting with some debit and prepaid examples. \nA few weeks ago we announced that SunTrust has chosen MasterCard to be its payments partner in debit. SunTrust will convert all of its debit card programs to MasterCard. After the conversion, which is expected to begin later this year, SunTrust will issue approximately 5 million MasterCard debit cards. This is a significant win for our U.S. debit business and we are very pleased to start off the year with this new partnership. Additionally, SunTrust will be expanding its current commercial offering in the future to include MasterCard commercial credit cards. We look forward to working with SunTrust to enhance the value of their payments business.\nIn January we renewed and extended our agreement with Woodforest Bank, one of our largest debit insurers based in Texas. This includes both our consumer and small business debit portfolios. We also renewed and extended our agreement with Primerica Bank in December, both our commercial cards and our public sector prepaid business with Primerica is included within the scope of this agreement. We're pleased to continue to work with both Primerica and Woodforest to grow our mutual businesses and to reinforce our already strong partnerships.\nIn a deal that represents both our prepaid expertise and our best-in-class processing capabilities, ABN AMRO in the Netherlands, has selected our IPS processing platform for their prepaid business.  IPS was implemented in 2009 and has enabled ABN AMRO to achieve back office efficiencies which has led to increased productivity and competitiveness in winning new business.  \nIn Germany, West LB started issuance of the first payback Maestro debit cards with the initial conversion of their private-label portfolio.  The new issuance has enabled cardholders to immediately benefit from value-adding Maestro functions including worldwide acceptance, secure online shopping through SecureCode, and contactless payments with PayPass.  PayBack is one of Europe's leading loyalty programs.  We're happy to be working with West LB and PayBack.\nTurning to some recent developments within our innovative platforms group, we're pleased with recent announcements about our MasterCard in Control offering.  As many of you know this is our innovative product that offers financial institutions an array of advanced authorization, routing, and alert controls that they can use to create products for their cardholders.\nIn the UK, Barclaycard will now offer the option of MasterCard in Control functionality.  This is the first consumer use of our service that enables cardholders to set spending controls and receive realtime information about their accounts.  Features include automated SMS alerts to keep tabs on spending, alerts and blocks for online card spending or high-value transactions, and weekly or monthly budgets with alerts when that budget is reached.\nIn mobile there are two developments I'd like to highlight.  In Canada we announced a mobile trial with Bank of Montreal and Research in Motion to bring mobile payments to Blackberry smart phones through our MasterCard PayPass Tap & Go technology.  \nIn Brazil, Ita\u00fa Unibanco and ReadyCARD with the mobile operator Vivo will be the first to use the MasterCard Mobile Payments Gateway to deliver mobile payment solutions to the bank's customers in Brazil.  This will allow customers to use their phone as a mobile wallet and link existing credit, debit, or prepaid MasterCard or Maestro accounts to their phone to fund mobile initiated payments.  In the transit space when you couple our leading contactless PayPass technology with the unparalleled speed of our network it results in great values and efficiencies for both transit systems and cardholders and we've had several new developments including in Turkey we expanded the number of cities that accept PayPass for transit payments.  In the UK contactless payments went live in Liverpool with Stagecoach's 200 strong bus network and Transport for London is also planning to accept PayPass.  \nIn France, the second phase of the public transportation trial with PayPass went live with RATP and La Banque Postale, and in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro we launched the first contactless payment application for public transportation in Latin America.\nOverall we're very pleased with the business momentum we have as we head into the new year.  We look forward to working with our customers and merchant partners on these and future opportunities that will make everyday commerce easier and more efficient for everyone involved.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Barbara so we can begin taking your questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nBarbara Gasper\nWe're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period.  And in order to get to as many people as possible in our allotted timeframe we ask that you limit yourself to a single question with one followup and then queue back in for additional questions.  Operator?\nOperator\n(Operator's Instructions) And your first question today comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with Keefe Bruyette & Woods.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe Bruyette & Woods\n\nOkay thank you.  I was wondering if I could get a little bit more color on the rebates line.  My math shows about 24% rebates to growth revenues.  I was wondering what we should expect specifically for 2010?  Will it be higher than this?  And could you just help with the seasonality in that line throughout the quarters?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nYeah, Sanjay.  What I referenced when I talked a little bit about 2010 was what you saw in 2008 from a rebate point of view and what you saw from 2009 a rebate point of view as a percentage of growth.  So when you look at 2008 percentage of growth rebates and incentives were almost 23%, like 22.7%.  And in 2009 as you know it goes up to 24% and what we are at this point in time expecting for 2010 is that the rates will be a little bit of a steeper increase than the differential between those two years.  Now please keep in mind we have a number of things going on.  We already told you the pricing changes that we made in October of 2009 has a rebate component to it and we pretty much gave you the numbers which allow you to calculate how much in that particular quarter our rebates related to pricing impacted the rebates and incentive line and that will be pretty much going on for all of 2010.  And then the other part will be due to the agreement we already signed and some new agreements that we are expecting to sign in 2010.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe Bruyette & Woods\nOkay.  And then just to followup on the pricing changes you mentioned, Martina.  I mean, could you provide a little bit more color as far as scope and timing?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nPricing changes, what do you mean?\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe Bruyette & Woods\nOh, in this year.\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nThis year?  Well, as you know the only real pricing changes that we have announced is an April pricing change, but other than that I don't think we have anything else to say at this point.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe Bruyette & Woods\nOkay great, thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.\nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs\nGreat, thanks.  Martina, just to sort of bracket your comments around the revenue growth.  So obviously your average target for revenue growth, it sounded like you're saying you were going to be below that, but better than the 3.9, so do we walk away from this with a range of 3.9-11 or can you just help us think a little bit better about the revenue growth there?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nYeah, Julio, that's a tough one because we do not give annual revenue guidance as you know, and so we just are trying to be helpful to focus it for you between what we saw last year.  Certainly we are going to see a better trajectory this year based on our assumptions, economic assumptions.  And you can try to do some calculations given the 12%-15% that we had on the table sometime ago, but we're not really giving an annual revenue guidance.\nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs\nOkay.  And just one quick followup, your target is a constant currency number.  In 2010 you are expecting currency to be \u2014 is it a benefit or a drag in your \u2014\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nJulio, it depends.  You're seeing what the euro is doing at this point in time.\nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs\nI know, I know (laughs).\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nApparently yesterday it broke the 1.39 barrier so Q1 and Q2 of last year we had like a 1.30-1.33 euro on average I think in the quarter so it definitely would be \u2014 I mean, unless they have the euro cratering we have still some benefit ahead of us, but that could turn in the latter part of the year.\nJulio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs\nOkay great.  Thank you, guys.  Good luck.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray.\nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray\nThank you.  A little bit of color, I'd like to get a little more color on the Maestro losses, the two Maestro losses in Europe and also the processing loss in the US?\nRobert W. Selander\nI think probably that is one that I referred to in my comments and you'll probably recall, and I think this was about two years ago, we lost some Maestro business in the UK and those conversions are working their way through our card numbers in terms of Maestro cards as well as processed transactions in the UK.  That will continue, I believe, throughout 2010, and we should be at what I would call I guess the new steady state starting 2011.\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nYeah.  Just to add to that, Bob, we have one customer that (inaudible) in the UK which will pretty much roll off in the middle of this year, one other which is going to go through the whole year, and then one US customer when we're not really sure when it will start, but we do think that our, at least process transaction numbers will be tempered for the whole year for that customer too.\nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray\nOkay.  My followup question I guess to try to dig a little bit more into rebates because I mean your big competitor doesn't seem to be having the same issue on rebates so I'm a little bit confused why you're having that issue.  And I guess when you talk about revenue growth you're talking about net revenue growth after rebates and you're still forecasting very big margin increases, but if you could \u2014 why are the rebates raising so much for you guys versus Visa?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nI'm not sure you can really make the statement in terms of our rebates increasing a lot more than our competitors, but what you do have to realize is that when you look at the growth revenues versus the net revenues, a number of us have different list prices and different tiers that we're giving to our customers to the numbers are not actually comparable in a very easy manner.  \nThe second thing that you have to factor in, which is a little different I have to say than what we had in the past, is what we did on the cross border pricing increasing which you had in October of 2009 which really has two components to it.  There is one component where it goes through the gross revenue line, the other component which goes now for the rebates and incentive line and you typically don't have that, Bob, so that's a new factor.  But we designed that price increase in a particular way in order to encourage our customers for a certain behavior and the financial perspective came out to be that way.  So that is a big component of the increase that you will see in 2010.\nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan\nThanks, good morning.  I had a couple of questions first I guess on the rebates and incentives.  I was kind of curious about \u2014 let me ask you this way.  Is this level a new normal for the company, meaning should we expect this kind of growth trajectory beyond 2010 given your ambition to grow the business?  And similarly should we change our thinking for longer-term revenue yield given what we're seeing in new bids?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nTien-Tsin it's Martina again.  I guess I'm not doing such a great job on rebates and incentives, but let me \u2014 I mean when you look back, and look back all the way back to the 2006 financials, you actually had ups and downs in the rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth quite a bit.  The real difference between 2009 and prior years in 2010 again is what we did on the cross border pricing.  In addition to that, as we are now growing and expecting to grow again you would expect rebates and incentives to also grow in sync with gross revenue growth.  And as we are going after a number of new agreements as well as some renewed agreements, that has a factor in it too.\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan\nGot it.  I guess that makes sense.  I was thinking about it beyond 2010, but it sounds like you're going to see a similar effect on net revenue.\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nYeah.  What I would urge you is to really look overall at the net revenue line and one thing that I just want to remind everybody on, rebates and incentives are very lumpy.  Quarter over quarter over quarter it's probably the hardest line for us to forecast as well as for you to forecast because it completely depends on when we sign a particular customer agreement.\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan\nOkay.  So maybe I'll ask then, in general when you sign a new deal, what drives the accounting for the up-front rebates versus ongoing rebates?  I believe it's different from Visa.  I just thought it might make sense to understand that a little bit better here.\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nYeah. I mean every deal is a little bit different, but if we do, for instance, sign-on bonuses, what we do is we amortize the sign-on bonuses equally over the years of the agreement.\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan\nOver the years of the agreement, got it.  I'll move off rebates and end with a quick one, just process transaction growth.  That came in a touch below our estimate, but the revenues there were actually in line so it looks like the revenue per transaction picked up a bit sequentially.  So my question is, is this level sustainable and is it indicative of the lower revenue yield of some of the lost business?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nNo, Tien-Tsin.  There are a number of other things that are going around.  When we actually look at the average ticket price per transaction it has not picked up in this point in time, but we had a number of other things in the transaction line that drive that growth and it's just the other normal items that we have like settlements, et cetera.\nTien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Bruce Harting with Barclays Capital.\nBruce Harting - Barclays Capital\nYou said to be careful about how we treat severance in terms of thinking about the growth in your guidance on flat expenses.  Can you just expand on that a little?  Should we be basing our 20% EPS growth off the number as reported or add back the severance cost?  And then also how do we think about the progression in terms of the flat expense with regard to severance?  Thanks.\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nGood question, Bruce.  The 20%-30% average annual net income growth should be calculated on the as reported numbers.  In terms of severance, for the whole year of 2009 we had almost $140 million of severance, $139 million of severance in the numbers.  Every year we had usually some small, very small amount of severance.  We think the small amount of severance will continue, but at this point in time we believe that we are by and large done with any employee-related actions so we are not going to foresee a large severance charge at this point in time.\nJust in terms of to be helpful in terms of what could drop to the bottom line, it's about a 2-2.2 year payback of the program so of that $140 million or so that we spent you can assume that in 2010 about $70-$80 million will drop to the bottom line on the G&A side.  Although as you heard in my comments we are reinvesting some of that money in specifically advertising and marketing as we said that would go up in the mid-single digit rate.  So hopefully that gives you a little bit of help on your model.\nBruce Harting - Barclays Capital\nThanks.  And then just a quick follow, my memory is that you said something about 200 basis points in 2010 prior guidance for pricing increase, is that still?  I didn't hear that mentioned today.\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nYeah.  What I actually said here as part of our 2010 assumptions is that we still expect some benefit from pricing, albeit at a lower rate than what we had in 2009.\nBruce Harting - Barclays Capital\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Sanford Bernstein.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford Bernstein\nGreat.  I was wondering if you could give us some updated trends maybe for the month of January.  We know at Visa, US credit volume growth turned positive in the month of December and in January and I was wondering if you could comment on whether MasterCard is experiencing similar trends on the US credit front and possibly even on the cross-border front as things seem to be improving into the month of January.\nRobert W. Selander\nWell, I think I made a couple of observations on that in my overview, Rod, in terms of our cross border volumes continuing to improve across all regions during the month of January.  They were better than what we saw in the fourth quarter which was low single-digit growth.  Once again I think regionally there are going to be some variations on that.  Asia-Pacific is very strong.  They continue to grow on a sequential basis.  From the standpoint of the US, cross-border volumes have improved from what were low single-digit declines and they are now trending slightly positive.\nIf you look at processed volumes which are a pretty good indicator, but they're not a perfect indicator of what the eventual gross dollar volume numbers will be that we report, process volume growth has continued in the US in the low-single digit rates and that's a blend of both credit and debit.  I don't have the credit breakout.  I don't know, Martina, do you have a sense of what credit debit is?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nYeah.  The credit is still in the low-single digit decline at this point in time and credit is still as healthy as it was before.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford Bernstein\nOkay.  And guys, just as followup, when you look at your major priorities for investment in 2010, should we be expecting your disproportion investment priorities in the areas of new customers wins maybe following on the SunTrust deal or possibly some priority investments in the area of sort of new product categories?\nRobert W. Selander\nI think you're going to find a little bit of all of the above.  If you think about it we've got a great global presence that we're operating with and there are clearly some of our customers and consumers in various markets in the world who are more healthy and more aggressive in terms of investing in their payments business and so we're trying to be there with them as that happens.  What we did this past year in realigning resources, and that manifested itself in terms of some of the severance and other charges we took that realignment process was to position ourselves to take advantage of what our customers were going to start doing or had begun doing in the course of last year and that varies by geography and product.  \nWe have a regional amount of energy going into Asia-Pacific and Latin America.  From a product sense, the affluent, the prepaid, and the debt, I've already shared some of the highlights and things we're seeing happening in the prepaid and debit marketplace in the first month of 2010.  So we think there's plenty of opportunities out there.  At the end of the day, globally with the size and importance of both the US and Western Europe we need those economies and those consumers to start getting better.  And while we see early positive signs we think we still have a ways to go.\nRod Bourgeois - Sanford Bernstein\nThat's helpful.  Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen & Co.\nMoshe Katri - Cowen & Co.\nYeah, thanks.  You've had a decent acceleration in year-over-year growth rates in all of your metrics whether it's GDV, purchase volume, cross border, et cetera.  Do you see anything out there that will slow down this trend or these trends as we go along throughout the year?  And then as a followup, can you comment on some of the trends you're seeing in credit, specifically in North America?  Thanks.\nRobert W. Selander\nBoy, let your imagination run wild in terms of the things that could adversely impact us.  I think it's been, for most businesses, a very challenging 18 months.  And while I think we've come through this one in a stronger position to capitalize on opportunities as they present themselves with our customers and in markets around the world, it also has made us acutely aware of how flexible and adaptable we have to be as the environmental conditions throw potential challenges our way.  As I said we're viewing the first half of the year as challenging and that makes us a little conservative I hope, or a little cautious, versus what the reality will be.  Then as I expect the world and at least the consensus of economists I follow, expect the world and the US and Europe to get healthier in the second half, and that would for me mean improving employment statistics, improving consumer confident statistics, and those are necessary for us to start to see the consumer reengage actively in the economy and that's really what we're all looking forward to.\nMoshe Katri - Cowen & Co.\nAny color on credit trends in North America?\nRobert W. Selander\nThe color commentary you just heard from Martina when we look at January's performance and compare it with the fourth quarter.  We continue to see year-over-year declines in credit and charge volume in the low single digit range.  Now that's significantly improved, but as you go back to the second quarter say of last year, we were seeing 15% order of magnitude year-over-year declines in our credit volumes.  Now, through this whole time debit has performed well and we see that continuing in January as well.\nMoshe Katri - Cowen & Co.\nThanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Adam Frisch with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Frisch - Morgan Stanley\nThanks, good morning.  Real fast on the rebates and incentive, I think we've kind of gone through that a lot, but just to clarify what's going on here, are you prepared to offset the increase in rebates incentives with cost management to preserve the 3%+ margin increase objective in the year?\nMartina Hund-Mejean\nAdam, obviously there are a lot of things that go in a P&L of a company, but net-net, what we said in the end we will be, or will be expecting at least to 2010 the 3-5 percentage point improvement in operating margin.\nAdam Frisch - Morgan Stanley\nOkay great, just wanted to clarify that.  And then you an Bob spoke to a bunch of different initiatives whether it be in emerging markets around the globe or prepaid and debit and all that kind of stuff.  There are a lot of things that were thrown out here.  If you could just clarify for us in terms of what are your top priorities right now in terms of spend?  Maybe rank the top three or four or five or something just to give us an idea in terms of how you're allocating resources, that would be helpful.\nRobert W. Selander\nYeah.  As we went through our budget process we really went down to a local market level to an extent that we hadn't in several years and that's because of the fairly significant divergence among various markets around the world both from the standpoint of the health of the financial institution and the health of the consumer and the economy, but also from the perspective of differing challenges in those markets with regard to the evolution of the structure of their payment system.  \nLet me be specific you still have a lot of ATM transactions in a market like Japan relative to the POS number of transactions that you would expect to see in a more developed market.  And so as we went through our planning process, we became very market focused and those initiatives that we felt would produce the best value for the company, and you will have to go market by market to answer that question. That is not something I am in a position to do today. \nThe three or four themes that emerged are the ones that I have already mentioned. We have got a lot of focus on the debit prepaid space around the world. The more affluent consumer has performed better, has gotten through this difficult time better, and has an increasing focus of the financial institutions we do business with, and as I already mentioned, our focus on making investments in some of the emerging markets, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and so forth, continues to have a high priority for the company as those are the places where we see greater growth opportunity for the near to midterm future. \nAdam Frisch - Morgan Stanley\nAny clarity in terms of the emerging markets, and obviously the Asia-Pac and Latin have a lot of different submarkets, but are there specific countries or regions that you are focused on in those areas?\nRobert W. Selander\nWell, I gave you a couple of examples of some programs we have announced. Brazil is a very exciting market for us. We have a great presence there, and we think we have great growth opportunities. That is one of the ones in Latin America. We believe that several in Asia are significant opportunities for us. India would be an example. Clearly Japan is a great growth opportunity. Australia \u2014 we are doing very well there. The economies tend to be better in that part of the world so there is a greater mix of opportunity right now probably in Asia than any other place in the world. \nAdam Frisch - Morgan Stanley\nOkay, thank you.\nBarbara Gasper\nOperator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator\nExcellent. Your last question comes from the line of James Kissane with Bank of America. \nJames Kissane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch\nGreat. Thanks, Barbara. Martina, could you clarify when you say that pricing added 5%. Is that a gross number or is that on a net basis, and has the definition changed as a result of \u2014\nMartina Hund-Mejean \nJust to remind everybody, what we do when we announce a pricing change is, is the change that we have in this price is less any particular related waivers or rebates, so it is the net number from that point of view, and what we have done for that 5% in this particular quarter, in particular on the cross border pricing is that we took the gross revenues and we deducted from it what we gave back in rebates, which I said is pretty much most of it. Okay? So you can count on that this is still the same kind of sensitivity as, you know, the same kind of calculation as we have done before. \nJames Kissane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch\nOkay, so if you look at the pricing on a gross basis where do you think it would be?\nMartina Hund-Mejean \nYou know, Jim, we don\u2019t give that kind of number. I don\u2019t think it is even relevant, you know, at this point in time. \nJames Kissane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch\nWell then, I guess, just philosophically how you think about rebates and incentives? I think Bob called it investment. Should we not think of it more as pricing actions?\nMartina Hund-Mejean \nOther than, let me just tell you, the crux (ph) as I said before on the cross border pricing that was a very particularly designed pricing to encourage customers for certain behaviors. If the customers do the certain behaviors that we encouraged them to do, they will get a rebate. We have not designed price increases like this before. So this is an extraordinary way of how we designed it and that is what you are seeing in addition to the normal development on the rebates and incentive line. We have not changed our thinking on the rest of the rebates and incentives. It truly goes with where the business goes, i.e. when you have increased gross revenues, you typically see an in line increase with rebates and incentives, and then in addition to that, when we sign new or renew agreements, you might see some variations in the line. \nJames Kissane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch\nGot you. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThis concludes the Q and A portion of the call. I will turn the call back over to Bob Selander for closing remarks. \nRobert W. Selander\nWell, thanks again for joining us today. We are very pleased with our strong fourth quarter and full year results, particularly since we deliver those results in what has been the most challenging business and economic environment we have faced, certainly since I have been at MasterCard and perhaps in the company\u2019s 44 year history. \nFortunately, when we headed into the economic crisis at the end of 2008, we did so as a strong company. Our business model, good capital structure, and sound management practices allowed us to remain flexible and adaptable as we weathered the storm. Now, some 18 months later, I believe we have emerged even stronger. \nWe have made investments that laid the groundwork for future growth, we have sharpened our focus on local market opportunities, and we have achieved efficiencies that allow us to benefit from a higher operating margin. As the global economy rebounds, we remain optimistic that our efforts of the last year and a half will pay dividends and prove their value in the future. So thanks again for your time today. Have a good one.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes our presentation and you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day. \n\n",

My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, all participants have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations Ms. Stacey Brodbar for opening remarks and introduction. Ms. Brodbar you may begin your conference.\nStacey Brodbar\nThank you, Jay and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2019 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide a brief overview of the strategic direction of our business. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer will then provide an update on our insurance segment. Lastly, Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer will highlight some key points about our financial performance.\nThe earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the investor section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.\nFinally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.\nNow, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Stephenson\nThanks, Stacy. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Verisk had another strong quarter of growth fueled by our market-leading innovation and continued focus on delivering an exceptional customer experience. Verisk reported organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.6% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.7%. This growth was driven by strength in our Insurance segment and solid improvements in Energy and Specialized Markets.\nOn the innovation front, I'm especially pleased to see strong revenue growth tied to the investments, we have made in platformed analytic environments. Such environments include our visualized ClaimSearch for fraud fighting and claims adjudication; our Touchstone platform for catastrophe modeling X1 for global property estimating, Lens for energy analytics; and our PowerAdvocate platform were adjusting and understanding supply chain costs in the Energy space. These platforms take the level of intimacy with our customers and their workflows to a whole new level and deliver enhanced growth and operating leverage.\nSpecifically at Wood Mackenzie, this month we released the second module to Lens called global upstream valuation, which expands screening and valuation capabilities across the whole world. This solution enables our customers to analyze and interact with out comprehensive global upstream data set to make faster data-driven commercial decisions.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the early results of Lens, but equally important is the fact that having a new and unique product in the marketplace has really energized our sales teams. This has translated into improving sales of our core research as well as strong growth in our breakout solutions, including subsurface, chemicals and the energy transition practice.\nOur energy transition practice was previously known as power and renewables and this shift reflects our commitment to helping our clients cope with changes in the energy markets. In our PowerAdvocate business we are experiencing strong growth as we are helping our energy customers use data to more effectively spend their capital and save costs. We see opportunities to leverage the C-suite relationships from Wood Mackenzie to introduce PowerAdvocate at an enterprise-wide level and also to help bring our spend and cost solution.\nOne of my leading indicators of the health of our business is how we are doing with the new disruptive players in our verticals as well as the largest and most established players. We are doing well on both fronts. We continue to win new business with InsurTech as they find value in our full suite of solutions and we continue to see progress in the cross-selling of even more valuable solutions to the established leaders in all three of our verticals.\nI spent several weeks in Asia recently visiting with client leaders across our verticals from Saudi Arabia to India to Japan. What struck me was how alert the CEOs of the leading companies around the globe are to data analytic innovation and their extreme interest in Verisk solutions. We see this driving an increasing level of inquiry and a growing pipeline of opportunities for our products.\nI'm also pleased with the progress, we have made with respect to our infrastructure and analytic methods over the past 90 days. We continue to make steady progress in moving our computing infrastructure to the cloud.\nIn the past you've heard me talk about how cloud capacity grows in a linear fashion, whereas on-premise computing gets retired episodically at what I call shelves. Because of the great work of our team, we have now reached the first of those shelves and are seeing the expected efficiencies.\nWe will continue to pursue these infrastructure improvements and savings persistently by product over the next few years. The global expansion of our data science team is coming along nicely and we are delighted with the quality and capacity of our emerging data science team in Krak\u00f3w.\nWe are now out in the market with industry-standard insurance solutions that incorporate machine-learned methodologies which take the world of regulatory-ready methods to a whole new level.\nOn the strategic acquisition front our focus continues to be on adding valuable data sets within our existing verticals that can be leveraged across our enterprise to drive high returns on capital.\nGenscape and BuildFax represent opportunities to both extend their businesses and enhance our existing products and relationships. Genscape is a market leader in sensed data for the power, oil and gas and maritime end markets. Genscape uses a network of sensors to gather for -- or near real time. We believe we can create value by combining Genscape's real-time short-term data set with WoodMac's longer-term asset valuation data sets.\nWe plan to develop new analytics solutions based on these combined data sets and ultimately see the data set incorporated into the Lens platform so that it can be seamlessly integrated into customers' workflows. We also see opportunities to cross-sell and expand into new client segments as there is limited customer overlap.\nUltimately, we believe that Genscape as a part of WoodMac will bolster our journey as the energy mix shifts toward more of a balance between molecule-based and electron-based.\nBuildFax is a leading provider of proprietary condition and history data with a blue-chip customer base that is now part of our ISO underwriting business. We are excited to incorporate building property data and analytics solutions and see opportunities to develop new solutions as we partner with our insurance customers to help them drive their underwriting process to become quicker and more precise. We also see real opportunity to expand distribution and cross-sell BuildFax's core products across our customer base.\nFinally I'd like to take a minute to clarify developments in the imaging space. In connection with the jury verdict and associated injunction related to the Geomni roof report business we have recorded a $125 million legal reserve. We were disappointed in the verdict and plan to appeal once we receive final judgment.\nWith respect to the current operations, the ruling pertains to only some of what we do in our Geomni unit and our roof report business represents about 1% of our annual revenues.\nWe are energetically working to develop a non-infringing alternative method to the current tech adjusting the cost structure over the next few quarters in light of the injunction. To that end, we are taking aggressive steps to minimize the negative impact on profitability and cash flow of the roughly $7 million in lost quarterly revenue and should see sequential progress over the next several quarters.\nPerhaps the most important thing to note about our imagery business is the asset we have built in our image library and our image capture program. We now have a distinctive data asset on a national scale.\nWe continue to believe strongly that the combination of automated measurement through remote imagery and automated estimation and create great value for our insurance customers for Verisk and for our shareholders and remain committed to and is exciting about these technologies as ever.\nHaving gone through a number of specifics let me give you my overall assessment of where we stand. Our verticals are in great shape with a notable achievement of Energy and Specialized Markets exceeding Insurance's organic growth rate for the first time thus expanding our sticky recurrent subscription revenues.\nOur technical infrastructure is becoming more efficient in real-time and the technical talent of our team has grown through tapping new talent sources. We've supplemented our data sets with two acquisitions that we can leverage across our enterprise. While we have lost the contribution to revenue growth provided by 1% of our revenue, we exit the quarter stronger than we entered it.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Mark to provide some insights on our Insurance segment.\nMark Anquillare\nThank you, Scott. I'm pleased to share with you that we had another strong quarter in Insurance with all businesses looking to growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.7% was fueled by market-leading innovation and enhanced customer engagement. Our retention rates remain very high as we continue to focus on getting close to our customers and delivering a best-in-class customer service experience.\nDuring the quarter, underwriting and rating delivered strong organic constant currency revenue growth across both personal and commercial lines underwriting, extreme event modeling, and industry-standard insurance programs.\nWe continue to see great success in market share gains in personal lines due to the strong sales of our LightSpeed Auto suite of products. We're excited about the new sales and growing pipeline for our data-forward LightSpeed platform, extended into small commercial and personal property.\nIn the industry standard insurance programs, we're experiencing growth in customer accounts. We've had success winning engagements with new start-ups and InsurTech. In extreme event modeling, we're experiencing solid demand for our detailed models, driven by signings with new clients as well as expanding relationships with existing clients. We're also seeing increased interest in some of our newer solutions including our global resilience practice which works with governments and NGOs.\nDuring the quarter, we hosted several successful seminars for our catastrophe modeling business in Auckland, Sydney, London, and Zurich that touch more than 350 clients and prospects.\nAnd in October, we hosted Verisk Velocity, our signature event for underwriting and rating. The event focused on the future of the insurance industry with an eye towards digitization and automation of the insurance process. The conference attendance increased 46% versus last year as we attracted attendees from 130 insurance companies from around the world.\nFeedback was positive from participants. We're excited about the direction of our new solutions and our thought leadership in the property and casualty insurance industry. The agenda feature presentations and panel discussions by industry-thought leaders and allowed Verisk to showcase our latest pipeline InsurTech solution.\nIn fact, our customers are telling us that they look to Verisk to drive forward the innovation agenda because we not only develop leading solutions, but we can back them up with financial strength in a long and stable operating history. The claims business also delivered solid growth with contributions from claims analytics, repair cost estimating, remote imagery, and our international businesses.\nAs Scott mentioned, we're seeing nice success with our visualized ClaimSearch platform, which is delivering significant growth in usage and positive sentiment in customers. The platform offers customers improvements like real-time analytics, improved security and privacy protection, fast delivery, and is seamlessly integrated into workflows and claim systems.\nOn the international side, we're seeing solid growth from recent acquisitions like Validus in claims subrogation solution and ENI, claims automation, and fraud detection solution. They're now part of organic.\nA steady stream of first-to-market innovations is one of the four distinctives at Verisk and also a key driver of our growth. In the quarter, we announced several exciting new initiatives including the launch of our Sequel product suite in the U.S. The early feedback from the market is positive and the pipeline of interest from among our specialty commercial customers is robust.\nWe also announced solutions in new partnerships within the life insurance market. These solutions utilize the most advanced data analytic methods including advanced voice analytics, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and will enable Verisk to develop new benchmarking risk-scoring solutions that can help life insurance on direct policies and managed portfolio risk with increased speed and precision.\nWith that, let me now turn it over to Lee to cover the financials.\nLee Shavel\nThanks Mark. First I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. The presentation provides background, data trends, and analysis to support our conversation today.\nMoving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 9% to $653 million. In the current quarter, we incurred some significant non-operating expenses including firstly, the $125 million litigation reserve related to our remote imagery business; secondly, $29 million in acquisition-related earnout expenses as many of our acquisitions are on target to achieve payments for exceptional performance; and thirdly, a $6 million loss generated from the sale of our retail analytics solutions business, which was previously part of our Financial Services segment. In light of these expenses, net income and diluted GAAP EPS decreased approximately 80% to $33 million and $0.20 per share respectively.\nMoving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items including currency fluctuations, acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons, acquisition-related costs including earn-outs, dispositions and non-recurring items including the litigation reserve, remained solid.\nOn an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 7.6% in the third quarter of 2019, reflecting organic growth across all three segments and delivering on our long-term target of 7% growth.\nOf our three segments, Energy and Specialized Markets recorded the fastest growth, while Insurance also delivered solid results. This was offset in part by softer growth within Financial Services. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.7% demonstrating organic constant currency margin expansion, while also continuing to invest in future growth opportunities within our business.\nTotal adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 47.4%, flat with the prior year period. This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenue and EBITDA. Acquisitions decreased total adjusted EBITDA points in the period. On an organic basis and particularly on the pre-investment organic basis that we've discussed before, we saw a margin expansion demonstrating the exceptional operating leverage at the core of our businesses.\nOn that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 7.7% revenue growth, while adjusted EBITDA increased 7.9%. Within our underwriting and rating business, growth was very broad across our solution sets in personal lines and commercial lines.\nWe saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, LightSpeed auto suite of products, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe model solutions revenue. We also had positive contributions from our international business. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance in claims analytics, repair cost estimating solutions, remote imagery solutions and international markets.\nTotal adjusted EBITDA margin declined 25 basis points to 53.1% from 53.3% in the prior year period, reflecting leverage in our core business more than offset by investment in future growth opportunities and acquisitions.\nOur fastest-growing segment was Energy and Specialized Markets, which delivered revenue growth of 8.7% for the quarter, representing record growth for that segment. Strong growth in market and cost intelligence solutions, as well as noted improvement in our core research and consulting revenues, drove the growth.\nDespite volatility in the oil price and recent geopolitical events in the quarter, we continue to see a stable macro mat with new and innovative platforms that help our customers more efficiently drive revenue growth and deliver cost savings.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 10.9%, reflecting leverage on solid sales balanced with ongoing investments in breakout opportunities like Lens and our chemicals, subsurface and energy transition practice. Total adjusted EBITDA margin grew to 33.3% from 31.7%.\nFinancial Services revenue increased 2.7% in the quarter, led by solid growth in enterprise data management and fraud and credit risk management solutions. This was offset in part by decreases in portfolio management from non-recurring consulting revenues as well as some pushouts of certain projects.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 3.5% and total adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 32.8% from 35.5%. We have discussed previously the journey we are on to transition this business from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach, with an emphasis on steady growth.\nChange at scale is never linear and as we work through this process we will continue to see quarterly fluctuations on revenue and growth, which are higher than in our other business segments. That said, we are confident in the long-term potential of financial services as we set the business up on a stronger foundation.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the company completed an additional $200 million issuance of our 4.125 percentage senior notes due 2029 at an issuance price of 110.9% for an effective yield of 2.78%, into a fourth amendment to our revolving credit facility which reduced the borrowing capacity to $1 billion from $1.5 billion, extended the maturity date to August 15, 2024 and amended the pricing grid with lower rates and improved economics.\nReported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter down 3.2% from the prior year quarter due to the net repayments of our revolving credit facility. Total reported debt was $2.7 billion at September 30 unchanged from the year-end of 2018. Our leverage at the end of the quarter -- of the third quarter 2019 was 2.4 times.\nOur consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $312 million at September 30, 2019. Our reported effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter compared to 13.9% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of a lower level of option exercises and nondeductible earnout expenses in the current -- period.\nWe maintain our estimate of our effective tax rate in the full year 2019 to be between 19% and 21%. Adjusted net income was $186 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.12 for the third quarter, up 2.6% and 3.7% respectively. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a decrease in interest expense and lower share count. The benefits were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the quarter down 5.7% from the prior year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $780 million year-to-date, up 2.5% from the prior year. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter, up 10.1% from the prior year and CapEx represented 9.3% of total revenue in the quarter.\nWe now expect capital expenditures to come in at the low end of the $220 million to $240 million range, we provided for 2019. Free cash flow was $153 million for the quarter a decrease of 10.8% from the prior year, primarily due to higher income tax payments associated with a lower level of option exercises and timing differences related to the payment of certain expenses.\nFree cash flow was $627 million year-to-date, an increase of 3.4% from the prior year. During the third quarter we returned -- reserves through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 491,000 shares at a weighted average price of $152.84 for a total cost of $75 million.\nAt September 30, we had $228 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the fourth quarter.\nAnd on September 30, we paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. This year, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on December 31, 2019 for shareholders of record on December 13, 2019.\nWe are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and continue to manage capital prudently through internal investment strategic acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders, being confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term.\nWe continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik\nThank you. Good morning gentlemen. My first question is just broadly around innovation and I guess the existing contribution from those products. You mentioned a lot on the call today. And I think recently you launched the cyber data exchange court side etcetera, etcetera.\nIs there any way to parse out like how much of the last several years innovation is contributing to the revenue growth today?\nScott Stephenson\nIt's kind of hard to separate the effects Manav and reason is that, some of the innovation shows us as an entirely unique product with a very discrete revenue stream, but it also shows up as increased penetration of an existing product or price realization related to an existing product.\nSo it actually shows up in several places and an example of that would be the Lens platform which is supportive of \u2013 solutions, but also represents a discrete revenue stream in and of itself.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan\nThank you. Scott, you discussed the impact of the litigation with regard to Geomni. But could you just give us a sense of if you feel the future opportunity is reduced? Or I know you mentioned you're trying to find non-infringing ways to address the roofing opportunity. But are you shifting some focus to the non-roofing opportunities? Or just I guess, how should we think about the future here?\nScott Stephenson\nSo we've always been interested in remote imagery for a whole variety of reasons and actually those reasons relate to use cases, which are even beyond the insurance vertical and we're -- well. So first of all by way of context what we do is a lot more than just roof reporting.\nAnd we remain very interested in the category. We think that imaging remotely and then being able to in a very automated way translate what you've seen with the sensor is just -- that's an important technology for the world going forward, and we're intending to participate in it. We have participated in it and there are a number of ways to monetize the imagery itself. And so, no, I don't think that our opportunity is -- we don't see it any differently than we did.\nToni Kaplan\nThank you.\nScott Stephenson\nWelcome. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra\nThanks for taking my question. Can you just help size the annualized revenues for the two acquisitions Genscape and BuildFax? And then also just talk about the historic growth and margin profile for these two acquisitions. Thanks.\nLee Shavel\nYeah. Ashish thanks for the question. We haven't broken out the revenues for those acquisitions separately. It will become organic. We're still closing Genscape and expect that within the next couple of weeks. But I would expect for the organic components incorporated in the fourth quarter results where you begin to get some sense of the scale of that.\nAshish Sabadra\nThat\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas [ph]. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst\nHi, Morning. Just wanted to stick with the Genscape acquisition. I was -- I know you guys gave some good color in your remarks and I appreciate that. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the product set, how it's complementary to your existing business potentially with an example. And then any synergies we can think about in pairing that with the Verisk business as it stands today? Thanks.\nScott Stephenson\nSure. So first of all just -- I want to make sure everybody understands the breadth of what we do in the energy space. So we work with oil and gas companies on a global basis. We work with those who are producing the alternatives in terms of the renewables and we also work with electric utilities.\nSo I wanted to sell that -- to say that the way that the Genscape business got built was by creating sensors, which actually talk about real-time flows in those ecosystems. So, for example, there are sensors that are literally measuring the amount of current running through the transmission line. There are sensors, which are literally metering the flow of liquefied natural gas for example.\nAnd these real-time data sets, we think are very complementary to the data sets we've already got. So in what we do with Wood Mackenzie, we have really good granular operating data, for example, from the wellhead. But it's not as real-time as these other data sets that we're talking about.\nSo now pull those two data sets together and provide even more of a perspective about what's happening commodity by commodity, location by location. And we just know that that's going to be valuable for our customers.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee. Your line is open.\nGary Bisbee\nYeah, thanks good morning. So, Scott you've been talking for a while now probably a couple of years about just the work you're doing with your technology infrastructure moving where appropriate to the cloud. You've also alluded to some efficiencies there and obviously, a lot of discussion of innovation. So can you just take a step back for us and talk about how you see the cloud and where you are in the process number one?\nNumber two, what you see the long-term opportunity? As I'm sure you're aware a number of your information services for have actually proven out meaningful cost saves but also have seen the ability to accelerate their innovation efforts by getting more of their data into the cloud and hooking customers into that. So, are you on that same path? Do you see those same opportunities? And where exactly are you today? Thank you.\nScott Stephenson\nYes. So, we -- yes, I mean so you really had there Gary the two categories of benefit that arise from rotating our infrastructure into the cloud. So, one of them has to do with agility and that has to do with we can compute anywhere around the world literally by going to our say AWS dashboard and turning on new servers. It's that easy and it's that fast.\nSo, the ability to spin up new products I would also say that our customers are increasingly interested in being able to interact with what we provide in a whole variety of ways.\nTo the extent that what they're interested in is the sort of API on demand kind of approach then being already platforms in the cloud just makes it even that easier for them to attach to it. So, you've got all those benefits and then you've got cost benefits.\nAnd so we're very much in pursuit of both of those. With respect to where we are in the journey, so you're right. We've been talking about it for a couple of years. It's a lot of heavy lifting and it does play out over time.\nSo, what I said in my remarks earlier is we've reached the first shelf. So, we've seen the first return of efficiency on the investments we've been making in moving to the cloud. There will be several more shelves over the course of the next couple of years. And so we feel very good about where we are.\nI'll just say that we have a very close relationship with one of the cloud provider -- convenient to sort of dig in, especially with one of them. And they give us a lot of feedback that says that we're actually in advanced implementation of cloud computing at the scale that we're doing it.\nSo, we -- there's a -- we still have a good distance to go. Actually I look forward to the next shelves. But in the meantime, I'm very pleased with the work that our team is doing.\nLee Shavel\nAnd Gary this is Lee. Just to supplement that a bit. And one thing that I want to make certain that everyone understands is that this is a discipline in a process. It's not a monolithic project where you do every -- a hundreds of individual products that need to be the data sets the applications need to be moved to the cloud. The code needs to be optimized for the cloud and so it is an ongoing process.\nWhat I can assure you is that the economics are very good both from an OpEx standpoint and from a CapEx standpoint. We are taking this with some kind of key projects that we've demonstrated what we can accomplish and that's guiding us in the future projects ahead.\nSo, we think this will be a very clear uplift for us from a capital efficiency and from a margin perspective that will factor into our ability to further enhance our operating leverage across the business. But I want to make sure that everyone has an appreciation. This is something that you literally have to go product-by-product in order to make sure that you're fully realizing the potential.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler\nYes, thank you. I wanted to ask about Energy and Specialized Markets and just make sure I'm not missing anything but it feels like the phrase solid improvement is underselling how good the numbers look to me. And when you describe it, I hear a lot of positive factors that sound recurring with I guess PowerAdvocate, cross-selling, the improvement in research and consulting and the Lens benefits.\nSo, is there any significant one-time revenue from consulting? Or I don't know if there's PowerAdvocate success fees or anything like that in the quarter. Or just curious on kind of the way you're characterizing the performance of that business. Thanks.\nLee Shavel\nYes. Thank you Jeff. We're obviously pleased with the results. I think I would try to break it down a bit by saying we saw solid improvement in those WoodMac -- in both the subscription and the consulting revenues at WoodMac. So, there was progress there.\nAnd PowerAdvocate is clearly contributing and I would say had -- is having an exceptional 2019 as a result from some very good pipeline build at the end of 2018 and into 2019. And so part of driving through, we are seeing that reflected both in some of the implementation revenue as well as the subscription revenue, but over time we will expect to see a higher percentage of that kind of core subscription and recurring revenue within it.\nAgain, it's still primarily recurring revenue, but we are at the front end of some of their success early in the year in bringing new clients onto their solutions platform.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey\nHi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. I wonder Mark or Lee, if you could just remind us about the macro exposure and insurance. And I'm thinking about two factors: one, generally a hardening P&C market to the extent we go into that kind of environment, how that might affect the insurance business; and then two, if you could just give us an update on cat modeling. We heard one of your competitors perhaps if the reinsurance market continues to soften. Doesn't seem appearing in your results, but I'm just wondering if you could weigh in sort of at a high level on those items?\nMark Anquillare\nSure. So let me try to take those and you already ask them. So first of all, I think the general macro environment has been -- needs to be positive. There is a hardening in the market, especially around some of the commercial lines. Over the years, we have distanced our pricing from the actual premium. So if you have this history, I will tell you we are much more thoughtful about long-term contracts and -- but there is a little bit of a pull associated with more premium and there's more utility of the solutions.\nSo, there's a little more value on pricing that we would gain. But I think the bigger macro trend is as the markets harden everyone is kind of focused on the top line and growing it profitably. So the use of our solutions, I think continues to expand. People look to go into different lines and grow. And purchase is more easily -- it's easier to get through procurement in an environment where growth is happening.\nSo those are kind of the general trends that affect us inside the market. I would also tell you from a macro perspective the industry is very much focused on big data analytics. So we're right in the wheelhouse there. They're focused on automation. They're trying to become more efficient. There's a lot of technology projects in search of automation. That works to our advantage as well.\nAnd finally, where we're trying to play more is inside the world of digitization. They're trying to make sure that their digital engagement with their policyholders continues to grow. And we had some solutions that help them.\nI don't want to make this too long. On the sort of reinsurance side, we do see an opportunity or at least more consolidation among reinsurers. When that happens, it does cause a little bit of a challenge as we kind of renegotiate with the combined entity.\nBut generally, we have seen increased engagement with insurers and reinsurers on the extreme event modeling side of things. There has been kind of a little bit of a turn, where people are coming and moving towards our AR models and that is a broad kind of industry trend that we are very happy with and I think they recognize the power of the Touchstone platform that Scott was referring to earlier. I hope that responds to your question.\nAndrew Jeffrey\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of George Tong. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. Scott with respect to the EagleView ruling you've indicated that you're working to adjust the cost structure of Geomni. My understanding is that Geomni is running at a loss. Just to confirm are you planning to taper your breakout investment spend in Geomni? Or are you planning to stay the course but redirect your investments elsewhere in aerial imagery?\nLee Shavel\nYeah. So George, thanks for the question. So as we described recognizing that we have this impact on the roof report revenue, our objective is to look for efficiencies that we can achieve in reducing the costs related to that dimension of the business. And again, that's just a part of the business in order to minimize the impact of that revenue -- the revenue loss.\nAt the same time, as Scott described, our commitment to the technology, our investment in the broader application of that business will continue. So we're trying to accomplish both of those, maintaining that commitment exploring the other applications and developing those dimensions, while at the same time offsetting as much as possible on that loss of revenue.\nGeorge Tong\nVery helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Christopher Campbell. Your line is open.\nChristopher Campbell\nYeah. Hi. Good morning. Just kind of a follow-up question on the Geomni question before. Is there -- I'm assuming that the margins are lower in the Geomni roof than your legacy P&C business. So with, like, kind of the rightsizing of this business, would that be accretive for Insurance segment margins?\nScott Stephenson\nWell, we're not making a forward statement about where the margins are going. But what I will say is, it has been a category of heavy investment on our part. And one of the things I was trying to emphasize in my comments upfront, because we made a lot of investments in image capture. We now have a national image capture capability.\nLee Shavel\nAnd I would confirm your assumption that on some of the non-roof report legacy businesses, that those were positive margin businesses and that the -- in development on the roof report, given the scaling up of those expenses, we're -- as we've indicated before, had a negative impact overall to our margins as we were in investment phase. So I think that observation is accurate.\nChristopher Campbell\nOkay. Thanks.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi. Your line is open.\nJoseph Foresi\nHi. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what the second shelf that you're referring to looks like, either from a margin or cash flow perspective. And what are the puts and takes on the margin side as we head into 2020?\nScott Stephenson\nYes. So maybe, Lee, you'd like to conclude and respond to that. But I'll just open by saying that there are really sort of two discrete things that go on as we hit these shelves. So one of them is -- and I'm pretty sure we've talked about this before, there's been a mainframe intensity to the way that we compute at Verisk.\nThat's because of our long legacy as an extremely data-rich company. And when this company first got going the mainframe configuration was very definitely the logical way to try to manage large data sets. But that's not true anymore. There has been change there.\nSo one of the shelf-creating developments is when we retire mainframe capacity and that is an ongoing activity. So that's one. And then, the second is, when we close data centers and that also will contribute shelves at moments in time as we go forward.\nThere are really no trade-offs, actually. I mean, in -- as I've said before, obviously, we build in a linear way the cost associated with cloud computing. But when I say there are no trade-offs I'm really saying two things. One is, the unit economics of computing in the cloud are just superior, period.\nBut the second thing is, actually, and Lee mentioned this when he took on the topic before, we actually are taking this opportunity to think about the very nature of our platforms. Literally, how does the calculation work? And as we move things up into the cloud, we're actually sort of peeling open the applications and reconsidering, you do this, you do this, then you do that, are there ways to be more efficient in capacity.\nAnd so, it's actually a very constructive exercise. We just have to continue to be vary in touch with the way that the algorithms tool and the way that the -- the very nature of our data and how we put together our data sets. So there are no trade-offs. Actually, it's constructive microeconomically. It's constructive in terms of responsiveness to customers. And actually, we're just treating it as a journey to tighten up a lot of things about the way that we operate.\nMark Anquillare\nAnd the only thing that maybe I'll use, tiers or shelves, there's a lot of investment that's required to do it right, right? You need to make sure you tune the application, so you use the cloud properly, so you don't overuse the processing time and effort. And as you transition, besides kind of this code rewrite, you're also taking advantage of cheaper database management systems and things like that.\nSo there's a ramp-up of cost before you see the benefit. And some of those are kind of trading off inside of our P&L and CapEx. And I just want to share that perspective with you about the timing of the shelves.\nJoseph Foresi\nFrom a quantitative perspective on, what the margins -- what this means for margins, going forward? I would assume that, Geomni kind of continuing to be more and more profitable and the data centers shifts going on.\nAnd we're moving towards the second shelf, that the margins would naturally start to improve. But I just don't want to get ahead of myself from a modeling perspective. Thanks.\nLee Shavel\nYeah. So let me try to kind of give some context around that. So, I think, what you heard in Scott and Mark's comments are, that yes there certainly is a cost savings in terms of achieving the shelves. But also it is kind of the net effect of taking on the cloud costs, and then also optimizing the business.\nAnd so, there is a complicated dimension to this. I want to underscore one thing. There clearly is a margin opportunity for us. But it consists both of greater OpEx efficiency, but also overall improvement in the operating leverage of the business itself in terms of what the applications can do and their ability to integrate other data and expand that.\nAnd again adding another layer of complexity, we have a large number of products and businesses that we are moving to the cloud of how applicable cloud is to what they do, and with different time lines.\nAnd so, it is impossible to extract what the quantum of that margin improvement is. We're learning as we go with each individual project tackling the biggest ones first. But we will see that positive margin improvement that we manage as part of our overall core objective of increasing margin over time. And then also investing that margin expansion to some level, where we are investing in future growth.\nSo, there is a lot of that. But it is clearly a very strong component of what will allow us to grow our core operating leverage further. And I know it would be great if we could provide some quantification. But it's just too large a project. And too complex for us to pin that to a specific number.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington. Your line is open.\nBill Warmington\nGood morning, everyone.\nLee Shavel\nHi, Bill.\nBill Warmington\nSo a question for you on Financial Services, the -- just wanted to ask about the product push outs, whether those go into Q4 or whether they're going into 2020? Or is it indefinite. And then, sort of along those lines on the EDM transition to more of a subscription model, what inning are we in there?\nLee Shavel\nBill on the push outs I think, we had some of the third quarter revenues. And some of them are longer development products that got pushed out into the fourth quarter. There were some that I think they pushed out into 2020. So I think a combination there.\nAnd with regard to EDM, I think it is still a development project for us. We continue to see a very strong response from customers. And we're dealing with really substantiating this as a broader opportunity within the business on a client-by-client basis.\nSo very early stage, but everything that we have seen and continues to keep us enthusiastic about this as a core service, that is additive to our most important and largest clients.\nBill Warmington\nWell, thank you very much.\nLee Shavel\nThanks, Bill.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Presenters, you may proceed.\nScott Stephenson\nYeah. Thank you. So, thanks everybody for joining us. Appreciate the questions, and the dialogue will be following up with several of you. And have a great day.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.\n\n",

And welcome to the Church & Dwight Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that, on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatt Farrell\nOkay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q3 results, and I'll turn the call over to Rick, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions.\nThe pandemic has given us an opportunity to display our agility as a company. We increased our communications with retailers. We changed our marketing messages. We shifted investments to categories that are most important to consumers. And we set new production records for VITAFUSION, ARM & HAMMER laundry and ARM & HAMMER baking soda. And we've moved people to focus on the online class of trade.\nSo we've been proactive in seizing the opportunities presented by the crisis and are increasing manufacturing capacity in our plants and externally with new co-packers. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work. Their efforts are paying off. The agility and resilience of the Church & Dwight team is showing up in our results.\nOur priorities continue to be employee safety, meeting the needs of consumers and retailers, helping the communities where we live and ensuring the strength of our brands. Our plant warehouse and laboratory employees have done an exceptional job keeping safe, which has contributed to our ability to operate our supply chain.\nOur office employees continue to work remotely and are doing a super job running the company. So now let's talk about the results. Q3 was another exceptional quarter. Reported sales growth was 13. 9% and adjusted EPS was $0.70. Revenue, earnings and operating cash flow were all significantly higher in Q3 than last year, driven by the significant increase in demand for many of our products.\nOrganic sales grew 9. 9%, driven by higher consumption. Regarding e-commerce, we were already strong pre COVID and well positioned online. In Q3, our online sales increased by 77% as all retailer.coms have grown.\nOne example would be gummy vitamins. In 2019, 8% of our full year sales were online. This year, we expect full year to be about 14% online. Recall, we began the year targeting 9% online sales as a percentage of global consumer sales. In Q1, it was 10% online, Q2 13% and Q3 also 13%. So we expect the full year to be actually close to 13% as well.\nWe continue to conduct research on the purchasing habits of U.S. consumers. There is no surprises here, actually. There is continued consumer concern that stores will run out of stock and websites will face delivery issues. Consumers report that they are consolidating shopping trips and continue to stockpile to ensure that they have enough product for a couple of weeks at a time.\nIf we look at year-to-date shipment and consumption patterns, our brands remain generally in balance in the 15 categories in which we compete. With respect to our brands, we had broad based consumption growth in Q3. We saw a double-digit consumption growth in VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda, OXICLEAN, FLAWLESS, ORAJEL, NAIR, First Response pregnancy kits and cleaners.\nIn Household, our laundry business consumption was up 4% and ARM & HAMMER cat litter was up 8%. Water flossers is another bright spot, as consumption turned slightly positive in Q3. Although our lunch and learn activity continues to be significantly curtailed, we intend to continue to address this with incremental advertising.\nIn addition to VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS, water flossers is another brand we expect to benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. BATISTE dry shampoo remains impacted by social distancing, with consumption down 10%, but improved sequentially compared to Q2 when consumption was down 22%.\nTROJAN consumption was down 6% Q3, but also improved sequentially when we were down 15% in Q2. There's no doubt that consumers have made health and wellness of priority. VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins saw the greatest consumption growth of any of our categories in Q3, up 49%.\nThe category consumption was even higher. Our expectation is that consumer demand for gummy vitamins will remain high. And we have new third-party capacity coming online in late Q4 to take advantage of this trend.\nConsumers are focusing on health and wellness, but also cleaning, home cooking and new grooming routines. At a recent investor conference, you may have heard me cite consumer research that suggests it takes 66 days to form a new habit.\nAnd only time will tell, if all of these new behaviors will translate into permanently higher levels of consumption. But if they do endure over time, we believe we are well positioned.\nNow a few words about private label. As you know, our exposure to private label is limited to five categories. Private label shares have remained generally unchanged for the first, second and third quarters of this year.\nAnd now international. Our international business came through with double-digit organic growth in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our GMG business. That's our Global Markets Group and Canada.\nIn October, our GMG business is off to another strong start, and we continue to see strong POS recovery in Canada and Europe. After three consecutive quarters of growth, our Specialty Products business contracted 3.4% in Q3, primarily due to the poultry segment.\nNow turning to new products. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers even in this economy. In 2020, we've launched many new products, which are described in our press release. VITAFUSION gummy vitamins launched a number of new products. And to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity, we launched POWER ZINC and Elderberry Gummies.\nWe've launched ARM & HAMMER Clean & Simple, which has only six ingredients plus water, compared to 15 to 30 ingredients for typical liquid detergents. And in the second half, we launched ARM & HAMMER AbsorbX clumping cat litter, a new litter, which is 55% lighter than our regular litter.\nNow let's turn to the outlook. We're having an exceptional year. We now expect full year adjusted EPS growth of 13% to 14%, which is far above our evergreen target of 8% annual EPS growth. Given our strong performance, we have raised our full year outlook for sales growth to be approximately 11% and organic sales growth to be approximately 9%. As mentioned many times in the past, we take the long view in managing Church & Dwight, in order to sustain our evergreen model.\nIn the second half, we took the opportunity to increase our marketing spend behind our new products and we made incremental investments in the company. As we wind up the year, we are putting together our 2021 plan. It's safe to say that we have a high degree of confidence that we will meet our evergreen model in 2021. In February, we'll provide our detailed outlook for next year.\nNow in conclusion, I would like to remind everyone of the many reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight. The great thing about our company is we are positioned to do well in both good and bad economic times. The categories in which we play are largely essential to consumers.\nAnd we have a few categories that stand to benefit from the current environment. We have a balance of value and premium products. Our power brands are number one or number two in our categories. And we have low exposure to private label.\nWe're coming off some of the best growth quarters we've ever had. And with a strong balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquiring TSR-accretive businesses. We believe our company is stronger and more agile than ever. And finally, we have the resources, the common sense and the ambition to ensure that our brands perform well in the future.\nNext up is Rick to give you details on the third quarter.\nRick Dierker\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Third quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes an acquisition-related earnout adjustment, grew 6.1% to $0.70 compared to $0.66 in 2019.\nAs we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment will continue until the conclusion of the earnout period. Stronger-than-expected sales performance allowed the company to spend incrementally on marketing.\nReported revenue was up 13.9%, reflecting a continued increase in consumer demand for our products. Organic sales was up 9.9%, driven by a volume increase of 10.2%, partially offset by 0.3% of unfavorable product mix and pricing, primarily driven by new product support. Volume growth was driven by higher consumption.\nNow let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic, organic sales increased by 10.7%, largely due to higher volume. Overall, growth was led by VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, WATERPIK oral care products, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent and OXICLEAN stain fighters.\nWe commonly get asked to bridge the Nielsen reporting to our organic results. This quarter, tracked consumption was 7.7% for our brands compared to an organic sales increase of 10.7%. In this environment, one might assume that is recessionary retailer inventory.\nThat is not the case. We had 400 basis points of help from strong growth in untracked channels, primarily online, and 100 basis point drag from couponing to support new products.\nThe good news is, as you heard from Matt, consumption and shipments are in balance, both low double digits. Consumer International delivered 11.6% organic growth due to higher volume, offset by lower price and product mix. This was a great recovery for our international business from a flat Q2.\nGrowth was primarily driven by the Global Markets Group in Canada. For our SPD business, organic sales decreased 3.4% due to lower volume, offset by higher pricing. The lower volume was primarily driven by the non-dairy animal and food production in sodium bicarbonate business.\nTurning now to gross margin. Our third quarter gross margin was 45.5%, a 110 basis point decrease from a year ago. Gross margin was impacted by 110 basis point drag from tariffs and a 90 basis point impact from acquisition accounting.\nIn addition, to round out the Q3, gross margin bridge is a plus 100 basis points from price, volume mix, plus 160 basis points from productivity programs, offset by a drag of 80 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, inflation and higher distribution costs, as well as a drag of 90 basis points for COVID costs.\nMoving now to marketing. Marketing was up $45.7 million year-over-year as we invested behind our brands. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales increased 230 basis points to 13.8%. For SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A decreased 30 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to leverage from strong sales growth.\nOther expense all in was $12.3 million and $3.9 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 17.3% compared to 21.6% in 2019, a decrease of 430 basis points, primarily driven by higher tax benefits related to stock option exercises.\nAnd now turning to cash. For the first nine months of 2020, cash from operating activities increased 29% to $798 million due to significantly higher cash earnings and an improvement in working capital. As of September 30, cash on hand was $549 million.\nOur full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $100 million as we began to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. As I mentioned back at the Barclays conference in September, we do expect a step-up in CapEx over the next couple of years to approximately 3.5% of sales for these capacity-related investments.\nIn addition, as you read in the release, due to the strong cash position, the company may resume stock repurchases in the future. For Q4, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 9%, organic sales growth of approximately 8%. And as Matt mentioned, we have strong consumption across many of our categories.\nTurning to gross margin. We previously called 150 basis point contraction in the second half. Now we're saying down 190 basis points. The change is primarily due to nonrecurring supply chain costs. We also expect significant expense, and we have called flat for the year in terms of percent of sales, which implies a step-up in Q4. We also anticipate a lower tax rate.\nAs a result, we expect Q4 adjusted EPS to be $0.50 to $0.52 per share, excluding the acquisition and earnout adjustment as we exit 2020 with momentum. And now for the full year outlook, we now expect approximately 11% for year 2020 sales growth, which is above our previously 9% to 10% range.\nWe're also raising our full year organic sales growth to approximately 9%, up from our previous 7% to 8% outlook. We raised our cash from operations outlook to $975 million, which is up 13% versus year ago.\nTurning to gross margin. We expect gross margin to be down 20 basis points for the year, primarily due to the impact of acquisition accounting, COVID costs, incremental manufacturing and distribution capacity investments and the higher tariffs on WATERPIK.\nAs to tariffs, remember back in 2018, we got caught up in Tier 2 tariffs for which we were granted exemption in 2019. That exemption expired and was not extended as of Q3 2020. We continue to work on mitigating that impact. Another word or two on gross margin.\nPreviously, I have said the first half of the year was plus 150 basis points on gross margin and the second half was down 150 basis points on gross margin. And so our outlook as of last quarter was flat for the year. And then also last quarter, you heard me walk through investments we were making in the second half of 2020.\nExamples here included a new third-party logistics provider, outside storage to handle surge inventories, preliminary engineering on capacity, VMS outsourcing costs as well as other investments around automation, consumer research and analytics.\nSo what changed now we're calling down 190 basis points for the back half or down 20 basis points for the year, and that implies down 250 basis points for the quarter. We have some supply chain nonrecurring costs.\nHere are a few examples. First, because of our outsized growth, I mentioned last quarter, we're adding a new 3PL distribution center. In the quarter, we again had stronger sales. And as such, had duplicative outside storage locations and the new 3PL distribution center that wasn't operational.\nSo for a period of time, we had duplicative costs. We're also in the process of going through make-first buy decisions. And that will trigger a couple of asset write-offs likely in Q4. We have lean training across the plants. And finally, due to the great results this year, higher incentive comp cost that flow through COGS.\nSo our full year tax rate expectations are 19%, and we also raised our adjusted EPS growth to 13% to 14%. Now that we're through the outlook, I also want to spend a minute on FLAWLESS. As you saw in the release, we had an earnout benefit of approximately $50 million in the quarter in reported earnings. We exclude any of the earnout movements in adjusted EPS.\nSome color on that swing. As a backdrop, we bought that business for $475 million upfront and a $425 million earnout tied to year-end 2021 sales. That sales target represented in excess of 15% CAGR for 3 years off of a baseline of $180 million of trailing sales.\nOur revised 3-year CAGR for this business is closer to 8%. And as such, the earnout liability comes down and earnings go up. We're still positive on this business. And the strong consumption growth the past 6 months is a great indicator for the future. As you heard from Matt, the company is well positioned as we enter 2021.\nAnd with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMatt Farrell\nHi, Olivia. Are you there?\nOlivia Tong\nHi. Can you hear me?\nMatt Farrell\nYes, I hear you now.\nOlivia Tong\nOkay. Great. Good morning. First, I want to talk a little bit about some of the expenditures. First, on marketing, can you just talk a little bit about the key buckets of spending and whether is it more about frequency, depth of brands being advertised, more mediums and the e-commerce investment that you're making as well? Thanks.\nMatt Farrell\nYeah. Olivia, about 70% of our advertising right now is digital, and that's been moving up year-after-year. And it was accelerated more this year because of consumers moving online.\nAs far as where to invest, we have a couple of big launches right now. We have ARM & HAMMER CLEAN & SIMPLE, as I described in the opening comments and also in the script.\nIt's a new platform for us. It's got six ingredients plus water compared to many ingredients for the typical laundry detergent, and we think that's going to be a platform we can build on in the future. So we've been spending behind it.\nAnd the second is ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL ABSORBx. That's a new cat litter. We haven't had a strong cat litter in the category. There's been a lot of growth there over the years. So we came up with a brand-new cat litter that has a different substrate. That's 55% lighter than our existing cat litter. So we're getting behind that in the second half.\nThe third would be FLAWLESS. FLAWLESS is obviously a new brand that we acquired last year. It's an at-home solution. A lot of people are turning to devices instead of going to salons and spas that are generally closed and have lower volumes.\nSo we've been putting money behind FLAWLESS as well. And again, the other money would be on just brand building, which we've typically done in the past when we have the ability to spend.\nRick Dierker\nYes. And I would just add, Olivia, to that, right the brand-building comment is maybe a quarter ago, we did have some met of stocks as such, but 5 of our brands were growing share as of last quarter seven this quarter, and we think it's going to be even stronger than that as we exit the year.\nOlivia Tong\nCan I just follow up, too, on the strength in organic sales, obviously very strong, but I'm a bit getting off of that in the SG&A? Because it does seem that peers are growing maybe not 10%, but close to it on the top line, and they're seeing a lot better margin flow through. So can you just talk a little bit about the SG&A? Thank you.\nRick Dierker\nYeah, sure. No, you're right. We're getting phenomenal growth on the top line. SG&A, we're not getting the leverage maybe that you might think because we're also making investments. When we talked about investments last quarter, that transpired across the P&L.\nSo talking about marketing investment step-up. We're talking about supply chain investments, and we're talking about SG&A investments. And so as we look at analytics or we look at IT or cybersecurity or things that we can do to just bulletproof the company for many years to come, SG&A is one factor.\nMatt Farrell\nYeah. Olivia, we run Church & Dwight a very lean shop, so there's no shortage of good things in which we can invest across the company. So as Rick said, we got automation projects, not just in the plants, but office environment, new product initiatives, where we do a lot of test and learns, IT projects, R&D. These are all SG&A items.\nRick Dierker\nOlivia, you still there?\nOlivia Tong\nThank you.\nRick Dierker\nOkay.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, guys. And congrats on the strong quarter. Matt, a question for you just on longer term guidance. I mean, this is clearly an exceptional year for the company. I mean, probably the strongest in the company's history from a top line perspective.\nAnd you're planning on 9% organic growth this year, clearly investing in capacity. So there's recognition here that demand is going to be sustainably higher in some of your key categories, expanding relationships with co-manufacturers, et cetera.\nSo I don't expect you to guide for next year at this point. You'll do that in February. But should investors expect the company to revisit the longer-term algorithm as well? I mean, clearly, it would seem like 3% is not the appropriate number, nor do I think that's what's discounted in stock or in sell-side numbers. So maybe you could just comment on that. And then I have a follow-up for Rick on margins.\nMatt Farrell\nWell, in my comments, was it's safe to say we'll hit our number for next year, but we typically don't give the details or the numbers right now, as you know. But there's - we have a lot of tailwinds going into the next year, the biggest being in wellness - health and wellness, but also cleaning at-home grooming and at-home cooking.\nAll of those things are tailwind for us. And we do also expect an improvement in consumer mobility next year, and that's going to help the PC brands have an up year for those brands that are down this year.\nRick Dierker\nYeah, I want to make sure you heard that, Kevin. I know we have 12 pages of material that we read through during the call. Matt did say that we have a high degree of confidence on hitting our evergreen model next year.\nKevin Grundy\nGot it. Very clear. Rick, quick one for you, and then I'll pass along. A couple of areas that are getting increasing attention from investors would be the normalization or return of trade spending, as well as higher freight costs. With respect to promotion, we're starting to see that a little bit in the Nielsen data. You guys appear to be spending behind laundry and litter and household. Can you just talk a little bit about your intentions, what you're seeing competitively?\nAnd then, Rick, with respect to freight cost as well, maybe talk a little bit about that and maybe even broadly expectations from a planning perspective, and I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nRick Dierker\nYeah. When thinking about the promotional environment, you have to go to household, and household is laundry and litter. So if you go back to Q2, Kevin, and you look at sold on deal for laundry and litter, if you look year-over-year, Q2 2020, Q2 2019, litter was down like 800 basis points sold on deal and laundry was down 1,700 basis points.\nThe numbers were in Q2 laundry was sold on deal 19% and litter at 12%. If you go to go to Q3 and you look at laundry and litter sold on deal, you're going to see litter at 15% and laundry at 30%. So, they've stepped up a bit in laundry and litter. But if you still look at year-over-year, this is still a huge gap. So, 2019 Q3 sold on deal for laundry was 38%. It's 30% in Q3. So, it's still an 800-point gap.\nAnd then if you look at litter, it's also similar. Last year Q3, 23% sold on deal. This year, 15% sold on deal. So, an 800-point gap both in laundry and litter. So, as the in-stock levels have improved, promotional activity has slowly returned to normal, but it's still well below normal.\nMatt Farrell\nYes. And I would just add to what the gross margin impact of that is, right. The first half of the year, if you look at price, volume mix because this is where that would show up, price/volume mix for us was, on average, for the first half, a good guy of 180 basis points, 170 basis points or so. And remember, we pulled back a ton on trade and couponing because we just didn't want to exacerbate out of stocks.\nIn the second half of the year, that number was closer [Technical Difficulty] to a positive 80 basis points as [Technical Difficulty] promotional levels have started to return to normal and we're supporting our new products. So, while still positive, just a deceleration as a [Technical Difficulty] contributor maybe on margin.\nYour second question was distribution. [Technical Difficulty] of all spot loads were - wouldn't be picked up or rejected [Technical Difficulty] another way. And now that's up to about 25% of all spot loads in the industry are being rejected.\nFor us, the good thing is we do have a big - a large significant part that is dedicated lanes, right? We have some customers that are - that pick up. And so it's more on their supply or distribution network.\nBut I would just tell you, it's tight. Costs are increasing. Brokerage costs are increasing. But at the end of the day, we've done a good job managing that and is not as impactful for us because of our dedicated lanes.\nKevin Grundy\nThanks for the color guys. Good luck.\nMatt Farrell\nOkay. Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from and Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira\nYes. Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just following up on the commentary on the gross margin that you just gave now. Is it fair to assume that given the tariffs that were, I believe, started more in the back half of the year, right, that you had been hit by some of the tariffs, the tariffs in flow in - especially in the water flossing?\nIs it fair to assume that you're going to have lingering gross margin pressures, at least to the first half of the year, especially as you mentioned now some of the puts and takes? Or we should be seeing some mitigating or pricing as you go into 2021?\nMatt Farrell\nYes. No, it's a fair question, Andrea. Of course, if the tariffs come into the back half, then there'll be more pressure in the first half of next year. But I would just put you back to Matt's comment is we kind of tried to give kind of an outlook and said that in 2021, we believe that we're going to hit the evergreen model.\nAnd so that does mean margin expansion, as an example, because we have to - it's our job to mitigate things like that, whether it's where we manufacture from, how we can increase productivity. Our supply chain has done a fantastic job. We hit an all-time high this year in terms of productivity. Our good to great program. And that trend, we think, is going to continue.\nRick Dierker\nYes. The other thing, Andrew, to keep in mind, it's always - we always tend to focus on what can hurt you. But you say, yes, there's going to be some pressure on because of the tariffs initially. But you got to remember COVID is also going the other way. So that won't be as high, those COVID costs, in 2021 versus 2020. So there's always offsets.\nMatt Farrell\nYes. And let me give you an example because you might say, what happens if COVID spikes back up in 2021? Well, a big part of incremental cove COVID cost for us early on was just trying to ship as much product as we could to customers.\nAnd so we were shipping out less than full trucks. Right now that we've built inventory, now that we're building capacity, we have more flexibility to make sure that we don't run into that same issue again.\nAndrea Teixeira\nAnd then on the distribution centers, which, obviously, you're - it's the right thing to do. You're trying to get in third parties and all of that, and you're also investing a lot of money on your own capacity, when would you think on that end, you're going to be having the capacity coming through from a production standpoint and also the distribution? When you think you're going to hit those targets and alleviate those pressures that you said you called out as non-recurring.\nMatt Farrell\nYes. Well, the great news is we just did our first shipments from the new 3PL this past week. And so we believe we'll be up and running almost full board in Q1 of next year, which is fantastic. So that's distribution. That's a meaningful difference in terms of our shipping capacity overall for the network.\nFor manufacturing, right, if you do something in-house, it always takes about 18 months. But the good news is we said for vitamins specifically as an example, that we're going to go outside. And that's going to be outside for some small quantities already in Q4 and then ramped up really quickly at the beginning of 2021.\nAndrea Teixeira\nOkay. Great. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nRupesh Parikh\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Also congrats on a nice quarter.\nMatt Farrell\nHey, Rupesh.\nRupesh Parikh\nI just want to start - hey Matt, so I guess just starting out the M&A. Curious what you're seeing right now on the M&A front. And does anything change in terms of what you guys are looking at from an M&A perspective, just given the pandemic and maybe some new opportunities you see going forward?\nMatt Farrell\nWell, we've had the same criteria for many years, as you know, Rupesh, so I don't expect that to change. At one point, we thought that there may be a more properties come to market in the back half of the year as the election was looming. I guess that's still possible between next week and the end of the year.\nWe did do a deal once upon a time that started in mid-November when we closed it by the end of December. So we know that's possible. But I would say, with respect to criteria, it hasn't changed.\nRupesh Parikh\nOkay. Great. And then you guys also mentioned that you may resume share buybacks. So is it fair to assume that you may prioritize share buybacks over debt paydown near-term?\nRick Dierker\nWell, I mean, you got to keep in mind, Rupesh, that our debt-to-EBITDA levels are still 1 point - net debt to EBITDA is 1.1 times by end of the year. So in my mind, we can do both, no problem.\nRupesh Parikh\nOkay. Great. And then maybe just one last question. So there's been some question just around thinking about gross margins going forward. So clearly, you have some headwinds this year. We also have tailwinds from a lower promotional environment.\nHow do you think about the base level of gross margin as we look to next year? Like is it flat? I guess, is it modestly - I guess, a 20 basis point decline in gross margins? Is that the right way to think about the new base level, or could there be more? I don't know. More headwinds this year that are artificially depressing that base level in first quarter.\nRick Dierker\nWell, I mean, you heard Matt, and we talked about the COVID costs as an example that we think are extraordinarily high this year that won't be as high next year. But again, in January, February, when we go through our outlook, we'll go through it in detail. Today, we just want to leave you guys with that we're confident in achieving our evergreen model, and that means gross margin expansion.\nRupesh Parikh\nOkay, great. Thank you.\nRick Dierker\nAll right. Thanks, Rupesh.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about the vitamin business. I know you guys have expressed a high degree of confidence in both it being taking a sticky habit. And I think, assuming that you can lap the performance this year with growth in 2021 has to be a key part of the outlook.\nBecause as I look at it, at least using the Nielsen, not knowing, I don't have the full look of all channel. Vitamins is growing, is contributing maybe 50% of the top line growth in Consumer Domestic right now.\nSo I mean, historically, BMS has been a fairly cyclical business overall for the industry. So can you just maybe talk a little bit about why you think this time is different, why you think that taking vitamins is going to be something that really persists as people's degree of belief that immunity comes from vitamins? I just think that would be really helpful perspective that feels pretty critical to the outlook. Thanks.\nMatt Farrell\nYes. I think you're a little bit high in the 50% estimate.\nLauren Lieberman\nOkay. Am just using Nielsen. That's why I try to clarify.\nMatt Farrell\nYes. You're a bit over the line there. I think you have to remember that, when we bought this business, Gummies were 3% of BMS. And obviously, that's grown over time. And I think a lot of people have discovered gummy vitamins as a result of the pandemic. So you have a lot more consumers oriented towards gummy vitamins than they were in the past. So that's number one.\nNumber two is we're not growing as fast as the category. In Q2 and Q3, the category, on average, grew 55%, and we grew 40%. We grew 35% in Q2. And this is consumption, Lauren, and 49% in Q3. So consumers are looking for product. We're the number one brand, and we're sold out. We're capacity constrained.\nSo we're going to take the governor off the business as soon as we get this third-party capacity online, and we expect to get our fair share, which we're missing out on right now.\nAnd like I said in my remarks, it does take a while for a new habit to stick. But I don't expect the current levels to return back to 2019 levels. If anybody is thinking that's a possibility, I would steal that to worry.\nRick Dierker\nAnd just to give you some color, Lauren, on - we usually don't do this, but since you asked the question directly, we'll do it. VMS, and this is out of the 9.9% organic, it was about 1/3. So 1/3 of the growth out of the company's growth.\nLaundry was about 10%. WATERPIK was about 20%. OXICLEAN, it was about 10%. Litter was about 10%, baking soda was 10%. So it was pretty broad-based in my mind this quarter.\nLauren Lieberman\nOkay. Great. That's super helpful, helpful color. And then just on the CapEx\u2026\nRick Dierker\nThe other thing, too, I think, that with respect to health and wellness, you got to also keep in mind, WATERPIK water flossers. So they took a big hit in the second quarter as far as the sales being down year-over-year. So that business is not going to grow year-over-year in 2020 versus 2019. That's - but this is a perennial grower. And this is a business that have been growing 10% a year since we bought it.\nSo you got kind of a reset this year for WATERPIK. But there's so much growth ahead of us both in the U.S. and internationally. That's just going to get restarted next year. So long term, that's another one that's going to benefit from this focus on health and wellness.\nLauren Lieberman\nOkay. That's great. And then on the CapEx, just - and I know you've spoken around it, and maybe I've kind of missed the specifics, but the usual run rate is about 2% of sales, and I think you're going up to 3% to 4% over the next couple of years. It sounds though like for vitamin, it's more going to be a third party.\nSo I just wanted to understand a lot of where this extra CapEx is going because I think laundry was added this year, to get just some more color. And for how long you think that higher rate of CapEx continues?\nRick Dierker\nYeah. I said in my remarks is approximately 3.5%. So - and I said it for the first time at your conference, and I think I did say 3% or 4% then, but it's about 3.5% for about two years, and its laundry, litter and vitamins, laundry, we just had - we just are experiencing three or four years of growth in one year in many of our categories.\nAnd laundry is not - there's no exception. We just - I think we talked publicly last quarter about how we were sometimes better to be lucky than good, and we had a line come on in late March, early April. And that's already fully utilized.\nI mean, really, a brand-new line fully utilized within four to six months, right? And so we have great plans for laundry. That business is doing extremely well. And so we know that we have to add capacity there. Litter, I think you heard from Matt, I think in the quarter, as an example, it was up 8% on consumption. We have some great new products.\nSo again, we need to lay the groundwork for litter. For vitamins, you're right, we said initially you're going to go outside, but you have to go outside, if you need volume within months. Over the long term, of course, that's one of those businesses that we want to have in-house because we have expertise in gummy manufacturing.\nLauren Lieberman\nOkay. That's great. Thanks for all the time. I appreciate it.\nRick Dierker\nOkay.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala\nGood afternoon. Would you mind giving us a little more on ad spend, the increase here - your plans on increase to net spend maybe percentage of sales into 4Q? And also maybe some context of how much of the ad spend you're maybe pulling forward from 2021 into the back half of this year, given the strength of your P&L year-to-date?\nRick Dierker\nI wouldn't necessarily think of it as a pull forward. Remember, Rick said that on a full year basis, we're going to be comparable to 2019. It's just that in Q2 we have pulled the way back because we had lots of in stocks. So we were spending at a 10% level. We're in the 13s, meaning 10% as a percentage of sale in Q2. Q3 was obviously higher, 13% and change. And then our fourth quarter, we'll be around 14.5%. So we have a lot of spending coming in the fourth quarter.\nAnd again, it's behind these big new product launches. We just happen to have two big ones coinciding at the same time. And so we're concentrating our effort in the second half.\nMatt Farrell\nYes. The only thing I'd add to that is, last quarter, when I was asked, for the full year outlook on marketing, I said - somebody said, 'Hey, 11.5% to 12%, is that sweet spot?' And I said, 'Yes, it is.' And if you do the math based on our gross margin outlook and everything else, it would have put you at maybe the lower end of that range. And now we're saying we're at closer to 11.8% for the full year, which implies kind of a step-up from where we thought even three months ago.\nKaumil Gajrawala\nOkay. Got it. And if I could - I know we talked about gross margins a lot, but just to try to understand a little bit better from some of the information you gave us is, some of the gross margin pressure sounds like it will continue into the first half of next year.\nBut some of it such as duplicative storage and such sound like they are more temporary. Can you give us maybe a read on how much of the pressure is temporary? How much might be permanent as it relates to some of the things, you're putting in place?\nMatt Farrell\nYes. No, it's a fair question. I would say we kind of - I would just go through a couple of different lines. We talked about COVID, right? And those costs should be rolling back in terms of some of inefficiencies on how we shipped, especially early on in the front half. The WATERPIK tariffs, that will be probably a headwind in the first half.\nThe FLAWLESS accounting, the good news is we're out of that, the acquisition accounting. We've lapped all that noise, and there's going to be no impact next year from acquisition accounting, which has been a 40 basis point drag this year. So that's fairly significant.\nCommodities, for us, have actually - we've discussed this last few calls and resins and ethylene, for us, has been up the last few quarters. So nothing really new there. That will likely be a bit of a headwind. But then our productivity program, which I just said, was kind of hit an all-time record this year is going to be a tailwind and will offset that.\nSo I'm not going to get into the quarterly cadence. I would just tell you that at this point in time we're confident of gross margin expansion for next year. And a lot of those investments you heard me walk through, for Q4 specifically, are discrete onetime non-recurring items.\nKaumil Gajrawala\nOkay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.\nJoe Altobello\nThanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. So first question you guys have been very clear that you're extremely confident in hitting your evergreen targets next year. I know, Matt, you talked about a lot of permanent changes going on in consumer habits, which are clearly net-net beneficial to you. So I guess, what do you guys need to see to maybe rethink those evergreen targets, at least on the top line heading into 2021 and beyond?\nMatt Farrell\nYes, Joe, you got to give us a few months. I mean, we typically come out in February with these numbers. We just want to give everybody assurance that the evergreen models intact for next year. As far as how high is high, we have to - we'll come out with that in February.\nJoe Altobello\nWell, you said 66 days. So I think you were beyond that period, but just kidding. Secondly, on FLAWLESS. In terms of the revised outlook, 8% is obviously still a good number, but it's not 15%. How much of that delta is COVID-related? And how much of that is coming from other factors?\nMatt Farrell\nYes. I mean, we're not going to get into that. But I mean, just know that, right, especially retailers were closed for a period of time, right? So that jumping-off point, the baseline is really was depressed. But if you look at consumption right now, and you guys see this, but consumption for that business is just really strong. And it has been strong for the last six months. So it's a good indicator.\nJoe Altobello\nOkay. And just one last one, if I could. In terms of online sales, you mentioned it was up, I think, 77% this quarter, I think it was up 75% last quarter. So do you think that takes a step back next year? Or do you think this is a new plateau and we could increase penetration off of that 13% base going forward?\nRick Dierker\nYeah. Well, look, one of the things that we found is that there are many consumers that rarely used - order online and now have discovered it. And more and more people are discovering it. And I think as we get into the winter months, and it sounds like this COVID thing is not going away, there could be a resurgence, more and more people get use of it.\nSo I do think you may have one more quarter, Q1 where you'll have a big growth year-over-year just because Q1 of 2020 didn't spike as much as Q2 and Q3. But I do think it's going to - this March is going to continue, Joe, over time. We went back to 2015. We had 1% of our sales online, just 1%. And this year, it will be 13%.\nNow last year was 9% or 8%, this 8% going to 13%. So we had a big pop this year, 500 basis points, but we fully expect that this is going to be a significant part of our sales - online sales in the future. So we'll be well over 2020 in a few years.\nJoe Altobello\nGot it. Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nBill Chappell\nThanks. Good morning.\nMatt Farrell\nHey, Bill.\nBill Chappell\nI guess, first question on FLAWLESS. Just any color around the timing of, I guess, the change of the payout? And is it just COVID related they couldn't get to the three-year numbers in part because of that and the weak start? Or is there something else on the outlook where you - that you were seeing that you need to make a change now?\nMatt Farrell\nJoe just asked a similar question, Bill. I would say that our original methodology was an extremely aggressive growth number, right? And it was 15%-plus. It was in excess of 15%. So as we go through and time gets closer to that end of 2021, we have to right-size those expectations. And yeah, it's been a little bit choppy because of the current economic environment.\nBut like I said to Joe, we've had some really good consumption. We feel confident in that business and an 8% plus CAGR, we had sign up for that business every day of the week.\nRick Dierker\nIt may not be as big earnout as might initially been contemplated, but the prospects for the business are bright. So we think it's - the math is going to work out. This is going to be a real good acquisition for us.\nBill Chappell\nGot you. Well, in the same vein of Joe's questioning, how do you figure out on contract manufacturing versus internal expansion for some of the categories like vitamins or other at-home type categories that you're spiking now, which maybe they continue to grow in 2022 at this rate.\nBut certainly, it would seem like it would come back to earth. I mean are there areas where you're thinking, look, contract manufacturing makes sense for the next couple of years until we know more? Or are you changing your CapEx budget for next year at this point we need to step it up even faster?\nRick Dierker\nIt's a good question, Bill. It's a fair question. I'd tell you that, for those businesses, those are the keystones of the company, right? Those are the growth drivers. And we've had capacity plans in place. We have an outlook on three, four, five-year capacity and volume forecast. And it's not like it's a new demand. It's just fast-forwarding some of those plans that were already in place.\nBill Chappell\nOkay. So, did you change your CapEx budget for next year over the past year?\nRick Dierker\nYes. Yes. I announced that at Barclays, and I reemphasize it today that for the next two years we're going to approximate 3.5% of sales as we invest in capacity for laundry, litter and vitamins and distribution capacity as well.\nBill Chappell\nOkay, great. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan\nThanks and good morning everybody. Wanted to ask on promotional activity, just out of curiosity, who's pushing increasing promotions or point of sale or any sort of step-up there? Is it being done because, as you've talked about, you've got some upside to numbers, want to reinvest, I know not all of that goes into the promotional activity, I know some of that's in marketing, but is it the CPG companies? Is it the retailer? Is it both?\nAnd kind of how do you think about that looking out to 2021, obviously, with a lot of uncertainty, but would seem greater than this year, at least in absolute? So, anything that could be helpful.\nMatt Farrell\nYes. My comments earlier were that if you looked at Q2 versus Q3, that sold on deal has increased sequentially, but it's still down significantly year-over-year. So, the shorthand is both laundry and litter sold on deal is 800 basis points lower in Q3 of 2020 compared to Q3 2019. So - and the reason for that's recovered a bit is because of in-stock levels.\nAs far as you're trying to figure out what's going to happen in 2021, look, it's possible that it could stay where it is right now for a period of time as opposed to keep creeping up because, obviously, all the competitors are benefiting from the lower sold on deal year-over-year, and it doesn't seem to be affecting consumption. But I think we'll just - we'll update everybody with our thinking about 2021 sold on deal or promotion when we get to February, but it's too soon to speculate on that.\nMark Astrachan\nGot it. Okay. And then just quickly back to FLAWLESS. So maybe building on the other questions, I guess, why now in terms of changing the payout and the CAGR, especially given your commentary last quarter about seeing increasing at-home consumption given salon closings and such?\nAnd maybe bigger picture, does this at all change your thinking about which categories you focus on from an M&A standpoint, meaning more kind of the legacy HPC business versus some of the hardware businesses that you've acquired in recent times?\nRick Dierker\nYes. Maybe I'll take the first part, and then Matt can talk about M&A. But the reason we do it now is the accounting guidance says we need to look at it every quarter. And last quarter - in the last - really, the last two quarters, it's tough to go through the haze of the macro environment when there's a COVID impact or when retailers are closed. And so we're waiting for - as time goes by, you get a little bit more prudence on what's actually happening from a consumer trend.\nAnd while consumption is positive, it was just going to have to start at a lower baseline because of some of the retailers being closed and some of the consumption and demand trends. So, I guess, my answer would be, we look at it every quarter. We didn't make a big adjustment last quarter because we didn't have the visibility into the baseline like we do now.\nMatt Farrell\nYes. As far as the category itself, we've made a lot of investments in categories we thought there could be a tailwind. And so if you go back and we say we bought gummy vitamins in 2012 because we thought there would be a transition from capsules to gummies over time.\nAnd that's proved to be true, and we obviously benefited from what's happened this past year. And we bought WATERPIK. It was obviously a device, but we believed that gum health was going to become more important to consumers over time. And I think that's proven to be true.\nSo we think there's a lot of opportunity there going forward. When it comes to FLAWLESS, FLAWLESS is hair removal using a device. And there's historically been a stigma attached with using devices - women using devices to remove facial hair, both face and brows.\nWe thought that was going to pass over time. And we think that the COVID has - because spas and salons being closed, has helped the business because people have discovered the at-home solution.\nSo as far as how that's going to work out, that's going to work well for both the seller and the buyer, Church & Dwight, as far as the multiple ultimately that we will have paid for it. But our criteria hasn't changed, and all of those investments meet the same criteria and be the number one brand, you've got to be able to grow, got to be a high gross margin, asset-light and either have a competitive advantage.\nMark Astrachan\nThank you.\nMatt Farrell\nOkay.\nOperator\nThank you. And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Farrell for his final remarks.\nMatt Farrell\nYes. Hey, thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and we're looking forward to February, when we tell you about our 2021 plans. So thank you.\nOperator\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.\n\n",
